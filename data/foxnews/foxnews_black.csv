Legendary Dodge Challenger 'Black Ghost' street racer resurrected with 807 hp,"It's an infamous muscle car that hid in the shadows.

The ""Black Ghost"" is a 1970 Dodge Challenger R/T SE originally owned by Detroit police officer and U.S. Army veteran Dennis Qualls.

Qualls used it for street racing in the city, but kept a low profile given his profession.

He'd show up to race, usually dominate, then drive off into the night and disappear for months at a time instead of hanging out with the other drivers.

THE DODGE CHARGER DAYTONA SRT IS A ‘BADA--’ ELECTRIC MUSCLE CAR THAT SCREAMS LIKE A BANSHEE

The 426 Hemi V8-powered car was known as the ""Black Ghost"" until it mysteriously stopped showing up and faded into legend after Qualls reenlisted in the Army in the late 1970s.

Qualls mostly kept it in his garage until he died in 2015 and it passed onto his son, Gregory, who only then learned about its illicit history.

""I’d know Dad was taking the car out because starting it shook the house,"" Gregory Qualls told The Detroit News.

The car was added to the National Historic Vehicle Register of significant cars and trucks that's kept at the U.S. Library of Congress and maintained by the Hagerty Drivers Foundation in 2020. It even spent time on display on the National Mall last year.

Dodge is now saluting the car with a Challenger Black Ghost limited edition model that will be one of the last V8-powered muscle cars it ever builds before the Challenger is replaced by the electric Charger Daytona SRT in 2024.

DODGE DESIGNER EXPLAINS HOW TO MAKE ELECTRIC MUSCLE CARS LOOK COOL

The widebody Challenger is equipped with an 807 horsepower version of Dodge's supercharged 6.2-liter Hellcat V8 and a 20-by-11-inch wheel and tire package.

DODGE IS FINALLY SELLING A CHALLENGER CONVERTIBLE

Cosmetic updates include Dodge lettering on the nose, hood pins, black Brembo brake calipers, throwback Challenger script badges on the fenders, a white tail stripe and a unique alligator skin roof wrap inspired by the vinyl top on Qualls' car. The interior features Alcantara and leather trim, plus carbon fiber inserts and a Black Ghost dash plaque.

Dodge will build just 300 examples at a yet to be announced price that's likely to be above the $88,335 starting price for a Challenger Jailbreak model that it shares its body and engine with.

The Black Ghost is the sixth of seven special edition ""Last Call"" Challenger and Charger models Dodge is releasing in 2023.

It previously revealed the Challenger Shakedown, Charger Super Bee, Challenger and Charger Swingers, Charger King Daytona and there's one more on the way.

The seventh will be unveiled at the SEMA auto show in Las Vegas in November as the final new V8-powered Dodge model.

No details have been released, but Dodge CEO Tim Kuniskis said it will be ""history making,"" which suggests it could surpass the 808 hp Dodge Challenger SRT Demon as the most powerful muscle car ever built.",https://www.foxnews.com/auto/legendary-dodge-challenger-black-ghost,N/A
The mysterious 1970 Dodge Challenger 'Black Ghost' is up for auction and worth a fortune,"A once-mythical muscle car will be crossing the auction block soon.

The 1970 Dodge Challenger R/T SE was owned by Detroit police officer and decorated U.S. Army veteran Godfrey ""Dennis"" Qualls, who used it for illegal street racing on the famed Woodward and Telegraph Avenues.

Qualls kept a low profile because of his profession and didn't mingle much with the other racers.

He'd just show up every once in a while, usually win, and then drive off into the night in the 426 Hemi V8-powered coupe with its gator skin-patterned vinyl top and pistol grip shifter.

HERE'S WHEN THE LAST V8 DODGE MUSCLE CAR WILL BE REVEALED

It became known as the ""Black Ghost,"" but after a few years Qualls disappeared from the scene and faded into Motown lore, keeping his exploits close to the vest, and the car hidden away.

That was until 2014, when he let his son Gregory in on the story about the car in the garage that he used to ride in as a little boy. A year later, Dennis died from prostate cancer, leaving the Black Ghost to Gregory, who got it fixed up with a few friends and revealed it to the world again. It was considered so significant that when the news got out, it was added to the National Historic Vehicle Registry kept at the Library of Congress in 2020 and displayed on the National Mall.

This year, Dodge is even building 300 special-edition versions of the 2023 Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat Redeye that pay tribute to the Black Ghost, all powered by the brand's 807 hp supercharged V8 and priced around $100,000. But if you don't mind spending a little bit more, you can buy the real one instead.

This May, Gregory is sending the Black Ghost across the auction block at the Mecum Auctions event in Indianapolis, where it is expected to sell for an astonishing amount.

""This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and the value is well into seven figures,"" Mecum Auctions vice president of consignments Frank Mecum told Fox News Digital.

Even without its history, the car that Qualls paid $5,272 for is one of just 23 Challenger R/T SEs built that year with the Hemi and 4-speed manual transmission, with high-quality survivors worth hundreds of thousands today.

Jack Black hints a 'School of Rock' sequel could be coming: 'We strive to inspire',"Jack Black could be stepping back into the role of substitute teacher soon.

During a recent interview with SiriusXM, host Caity Babs, Black and his Tenacious D bandmate Kyle Glass spoke about the possibility of a sequel to the cult classic movies ""School of Rock"" and ""Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny.""

When asked if fans should hope for it, Black announced the ""breaking news"" that the two of them are ""thinking about doing both of those,"" before Glass suggested the sequel film be ""a hybrid"" of the two movies called ""School of D.""

Babs praised both films for being an influence on ""kids who thought they couldn't be musicians"" by allowing them to believe in themselves and chase their dreams. Black was moved by Babs' statement, telling her, ""That means a lot,"" with Glass acknowledging he and Black ""inspired"" and ""shaped young minds.""

JACK BLACK SINGS 'SCHOOL OF ROCK' SONG TO TERMINALLY ILL TEEN IN HEARTWARMING VIDEO

""We strive to inspire, but we also sometimes discourage if we feel like we tried, and we've seen what you've done, and we don't think you rock; you should stop rocking. We do both,"" Black said. ""We build them up, and we tear them down. But thank you for noticing the good parts.""

Babs said all of it was good, even the bad parts.

""The bad parts, like you say, are sometimes the best parts, and a lot of our best stuff comes from horrible mistakes, and you got to be able to be open to your own badness to really capture the magic,"" Black said.

""That's where the genius lies.""

""School of Rock"" follows the story of Dewey Finn, played by Black, an aspiring rock star who got kicked out of the band he started and whose friends are growing tired of his refusal to find a real job. He then poses as his friend to get a job as a substitute teacher at a prestigious elementary school, turning his class into a rock band to win a battle of the bands.

The movie also stars Joan Cusack, Miranda Cosgrove and the late Kevin Clark. In 2021, Black posted on Instagram he was ""heartbroken"" to hear the ""devastating news"" about Clark, calling the actor a ""beautiful soul"" with whom he ""shared so many great memories.""

While ""School of Rock"" was made for kids and equally enjoyed by adults, ""Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny"" is a raunchier take on two musicians' dreams of making it big in the industry. Glass and Black's characters steal a magical guitar pick from a rock and roll museum and somehow end up in a musical battle with Satan.

The title of the film was inspired by Glass and Black's real-life band, Tenacious D, which they started in 1994. They have released four albums: ""Tenacious D"" in 2001, ""The Pick of Destiny"" in 2006, ""Rize of the Fenix"" in 2012 and ""Post-Apocalypto"" in 2018. They won a Grammy Award in 2015 for best metal performance.

As for what they listen to in their spare time, Glass said he is happy to ""let the radio do the work"" for him. Black says he lets his 14- and 16-year-old sons take the reins when they're in the car.

""My boys play me some good music. I've been listening to whatever my kids are listening to when I take them to school every morning. … The last time they let me listen they were rocking some Death Grips,"" Black said.

""My youngest boy Tommy is playing a lot of drums, and he's really into death metal. ... There is a movement of rockers that just play by themselves, they play all their instruments, and it's the darkest, murkiest rock from the depths of their souls. It's kind of scary.

Jack Black sings 'School of Rock' song to terminally ill teen in heartwarming video,"Jack Black sang to a terminally ill young fan in a heartwarming video that was shared on social media.

The 53-year-old actor was hosting the Layla Paige and Friends Walk for TrinityKids Care charity event in Rancho Palos Verdes, California, on Oct. 6 when he was introduced to 15-year-old Abraham.

Black was seen smiling and kneeling down to shake hands with Abraham at the beginning of the clip, which was obtained by Fox News Digital.

Upon being told that ""School of Rock"" was Abraham's favorite movie and ""In the End of Time"" was his favorite song from the film, Black said, ""That's my favorite movie. Thank you.""

He then went into character and began singing the song to the delighted teen while holding his hand.

JACK BLACK MAY NOT BE RETIRING AFTER ALL: ‘I’M NOT GOING ANYWHERE'

Abraham smiled and nodded along as Black finished his serenade with a flourish while the crowd that had gathered around the two clapped and cheered.

In the 2003 comedy, Black played Dewey Finn, a rock guitarist who poses as a substitute teacher at a prestigious private elementary school. After turning his students into rock-n-roll fans, he forms a new band called ""School of Rock"" to compete at the Battle of the Bands.

Abraham's mother Veronica told Upworthy that her son's nurse knew that ""School of Rock"" was his favorite movie and arranged for the teen to meet Black at the event.

""It’s almost been a week since the meet and Abraham is still talking about how he got to meet Jack,"" Veronica told Upworthy.

According to the website, Abraham has Pearson syndrome, a rare mitochondrial disease that makes it hard for the body's cells to make energy.

For the past year, he has been in palliative care at TrinityKids Care, a dedicated pediatric hospice program in Los Angeles and Orange counties.

It was the third time that Black hosted the walk, which raises money for Trinitykids Care.

In addition to his acting career, Black also makes up one half of the Grammy Award-winning comedy rock duo Tenacious D.

Last April, Black talked about ""School of Rock"" ahead of the film's 20th anniversary next year. He told Entertainment Tonight, ""My best memories are just that group of kids, and how funny and great they were.""

He continued,""This is my take on celebrating [their] natural form and the beauty of being one's self. I wanted to create an image which people have never seen Sam in.""

Last month, Smith divided Twitter after releasing a music video featuring hyper-sexualized scenes, including the performer wearing nipple clasps while having liquid blasted in their face.

The music video was for the album single ""I’m Not Here to Make Friends"" from their new album ""Gloria.""

In one scene, Smith is undressed down to a glittery corset and underwear complete with nipple pasties and a tiara. Back up talent dances around the singer in similar attire, with the addition of pants with the back cut-out in the shape of a heart. Smith squats over the dancers planking on the ground and pats their behinds.

Another scene shows dancers in leather underwear and BDSM gear moving suggestively along a row of beds, contorting themselves into flexible positions and rolling their bodies atop one another.

The scenes sparked intense debate online, with some praising Smith for their confidence and others condemning the sexual material. Some called for an overhaul to age restrictions on music videos.

At the BRIT Awards, Smith and transgender singer Kim Petras donned black leather ensembles as they delivered a raunchy performance of their Grammy Award-winning song ""Unholy.""

Texas fishermen reel in rare black alligator gar: 'Wild experience',"Two fishermen in Texas were shocked when they reeled in a rare, black alligator gar last week.

Justin Jordan, 29, a fishing guide in Galveston, Texas, told Fox News Digital on Monday about the moment he saw the unique fish.

""It was a pretty wild experience,"" Jordan said.

TEXAS MAN CATCHES 9.5-FOOT TIGER SHARK WITH THE HELP OF A DRONE

Jordan – who runs Lotus Guide Service – said he’s been fishing in the Galveston area for his whole life, but only just started guiding last year.

On May 15, Jordan was out on the water with fellow fisherman Terrell Maguire when they noticed a ""menacing looking"" fish in the marshes, Jordan said.

Maguire cast his fly and the gar went for it almost right away, Jordan added.

""The fish started jumping out of the water and going crazy,"" Jordan said. ""When we got it over to the boat and it reached the surface, we saw it and it was jet black.""

Jordan said he immediately recognized it as a melanistic alligator gar, which is a gar with a high level of melanin.

Typically, alligator gars are more of an olive brown color, according to National Geographic. FTW Outdoors reported that fishermen rarely see or catch melanistic alligator gar.

The fish can also grow up to 10 feet long and weigh up to 350 pounds, National Geographic reported.

The alligator gar that Maguire reeled in was only about five feet long, according to Jordan.

""We took some pictures and picked it up and then put it back in the water and let it loose,"" Jordan said of the catch.

""It was really cool,"" Jordan added. ""It was special. It’s almost like it was meant to happen, that we were supposed to catch that fish.""

Though Jordan said he sees alligator gar all the time, this was the first melanistic alligator gar he’s ever seen.

""We’ve caught some oddities, but it’s not really what we go for,"" Jordan said. ""You always get some crazy looking stuff, but never a jet black gar, that’s for sure.""

Beautiful black bear with white fur in Michigan is killed by wolves shortly after a sighting,"A rare black bear with white fur has met a tragic end after it was spotted in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula.

The one-in-a-million bear was killed by wolves shortly after photos of the bear were posted by Facebook group Yooper Outdoors #906 on Sept. 6, 2022.

The group, a Michigan-based guide service and outfitter, informed Fox News Digital this week that the white-colored black bear was found dead following the early-September sighting of the animal.

THE BALD EAGLE: A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE GREAT CONSERVATION SUCCESS STORY OF AMERICA'S BIRD

""Our wolf population has devastated our big game populations in the U.P.,"" Yooper Outdoors #906 wrote in a Facebook chat.

The bear was originally caught on a trail camera in Michigan’s western upper peninsula.

It had been rummaging through bait placed there by a hunter.

""There’s been a white black bear on camera in the Yoop!"" the post reads.

""Extremely rare, but [you] never know what [may be] walking into your bait!""

Michigan’s Department of Natural Resources told Fox 2 Detroit that they’re ""fairly certain"" the bear actually has a white coat.

""I thought it was just too cool,"" said DNR large carnivore specialist Cody Norton.

""It's just exciting seeing an animal pop up like this here instead of somewhere else.""

""We've had some cinnamon color phases show up, some blonde and chocolate on some trail cameras we use for surveys, which is also really cool to see,"" he said.

""But those are more common in bear populations. White is its own thing.""

The bear was about two years old and was most likely the rare product of two bears that both held a recessive gene for white fur, according to Norton and Fox 2 Detroit.

This happens almost exclusively in western Canada where Kermode bears — an American black bear subspecies — reside in the province, the same sources indicated.

Only up to 20% of the bear population has white fur.

These bears are sometimes referred to as ""spirit bears.""

Black Friday: A brief history and little known facts,"Black Friday has long served as the kick-off for the holiday shopping season, but the annual retail event is a day that’s arguably shrouded in a little mystery.

While competing myths may have left some history-loving shoppers scratching their heads, the general consensus is that Black Friday got its start in Pennsylvania in the 20th century.

""Many people think that ‘Black Friday’ comes from the idea that it’s a highly profitable day for retailers, one where they’re getting ‘out of the red’ and ‘into the black,’"" said Jay Myers, the co-founder and vice president of growth at Bold Commerce.

HOW TO SCORE THE BEST DEALS THIS BLACK FRIDAY, CYBER MONDAY

""The term didn’t actually originate from retailers,"" he added. ""Philadelphia police officers first used the term ‘Black Friday’ in the 1960s to describe the day after Thanksgiving, when a flurry of tourists came into the city to shop, causing traffic jams and accidents.""

Black Friday Little Known Facts

1. The first recorded ‘Black Friday’: The first time the term ""Black Friday"" was used on a national level came in September 1869. But, it wasn’t in reference to holiday shopping, according to Encyclopedia Britannica.

History records show the term was used to describe American Wall Street financiers Jay Gould and Jim Fisk, who bought up a significant portion of the nation’s gold to drive up the price. The pair weren’t able to re-sell the gold at the inflated profit margins they planned for and their business venture got unveiled on Sept. 24, 1869.

""The scheme ultimately came to light on that Friday in September, throwing the stock market into rapid decline and bankrupting everybody from Wall Street millionaires to poor citizens,"" said Lyle David Solomon, a bankruptcy attorney at Oak View Law Group. ""The stock market plummeted by 20%, and foreign trading ceased. The value of wheat and corn harvests dropped by half for peasants.""

AMERICA'S 'UNIQUE' THANKSGIVING STUFFING PREFERENCES STATE-BY-STATE

2. Black Friday is celebrated in other countries: America isn’t the only country that celebrates Black Friday. Fourteen countries reportedly observe the annual holiday shopping event, according to Baruch Labunski – the CEO at Rank Secure, a digital analytics and SEO marketing firm.

The countries that observe Black Friday include Canada, the U.K., South Africa, Ireland, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Brazil, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand.

3. Black Friday sale events have extended: For more than 60 years, Black Friday has been one of the busiest days for retail stores and holiday shoppers. The event has gotten longer with early or extended Black Friday doorbusters that customers can take advantage of in stores and online.

"Black history through the years: Rosa Parks, Sojourner Truth, MLK Jr. and other famous figures in the US","Black history in the U.S. dates back to 1619, when enslaved Africans were brought to Jamestown Colony — present-day Williamsburg, Virginia.

Since then, Black Americans have persevered despite enormous challenges throughout the nation’s history and have been able to leave their mark on American culture.

Every February, the nation celebrates Black History Month by honoring the contributions of African Americans while also recognizing that the fight for racial justice continues today.

BLACK HISTORY MONTH QUIZ: TEST YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF THIS MONTH OF TRIBUTE

The theme for February is ""Black Resistance,"" with festivals and events occurring in community centers across the U.S., according to the Association for the Study of African American Life and History.

From trailblazing abolitionists, scientists and artists to politicians, judges and civil rights leaders, numerous historical figures have done their part to shape America into the country it is today.

Here are 10 famous figures and the impactful contributions they made over the years.

1. Sojourner Truth

Sojourner Truth was born in 1797 under the name Isabella Baumfree, in Ulster County, New York — where slavery was still legal at the time. She escaped to freedom in 1826 with her infant daughter after her owner refused to comply with the gradual abolition of slavery law New York had passed, the National Parks Service reports.

Baumfree later freed her son, who had been sold to an Alabama slave owner, by bringing her case to court.

BLACK HISTORY MONTH FACTS: 10 THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW

By 1828, she became the first Black woman to win a case against a former slave owner.

Almost two decades later, Baumfree joined a Methodist church and changed her name to Sojourner Truth as she traveled the country to promote the abolition of slavery, the advancement of women’s rights, and religious tolerance.

Baumfree famously delivered her ""Ain’t I a Woman?"" speech in 1851 at the Ohio Women’s Rights Convention and met President Lincoln in 1864 through her work for the National Freedmen’s Relief Association. She also dictated a group of memoirs that were published in her book ""The Narrative of Sojourner Truth: a Northern Slave"" (1850).

2. Frederick Douglass

Frederick Douglass, an American abolitionist and orator, was born as an enslaved person in February 1818 in Talbot County, Maryland.

He became a national leader in the abolitionist movement in New York and Massachusetts after escaping bondage as a disguised sailor, according to the Library of Congress.

Douglass delivered moving speeches and essays about his experience and anti-slavery stance, including his ""What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July?"" speech (1852) and ""Life and Times of Frederick Douglass"" autobiography (1881).

Douglass also fought for civil reforms, including equal treatment for Black Americans and women, free public education and the end of capital punishment.

Harriet Tubman, conductor of the Underground Railroad and a Union Army spy, was born in March 1822 in Dorchester County, Maryland, under the name Araminta Ross.

She changed her name in 1844 following her marriage to John Tubman, a free man, the National Parks Service reports. About five years after her marriage, Tubman escaped to freedom in Philadelphia, where slavery was abolished.

Tubman personally made ""about 13 trips into Maryland"" to free her companions and provided a map to freedom to ""about 70 more.""

Tubman spent the next decade of her life rescuing family and friends in what is now known as the Underground Railroad. She personally made ""about 13 trips into Maryland"" to free her companions and provided a map to freedom to ""about 70 more,"" according to the NPS.

By the time the American Civil War broke out in the 1860s, Tubman served as an instrumental spy for the Union Army. She famously joined Colonel James Montgomery and his 2nd South Carolina Infantry during the group’s 1863 raid on Combahee River plantations, where Tubman provided scouting, nursing, and cooking aid.

4. George Washington Carver

Agriculture scientist and educator George Washington Carver was born in the early- or mid-1860s in Diamond, Missouri.

While initially enslaved with his mother and sister, Carver was separated from his family after he was kidnapped in a slave raid. The Carver family retrieved him from his captors and eventually taught him to read, write, and care for plants after the abolishment of slavery in 1865.

Carver went on to attend various schools in the Midwest. He was accepted into the botany program at the Iowa State Agricultural School and became the first African American to earn a bachelor's and master's of science degree.

Carver’s agricultural research and inventions led to advancements in soil health, conservation, and rotational peanut crops, the USDA reports.

Carver famously made a variety of peanut-based products and herbal concoctions, and later became a professor at the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, a historically Black college.

5. Ida B. Wells

American journalist and civil rights advocate Ida B. Wells was born in Holly Springs, Mississippi, on July 16, 1862, five months and two weeks before the delivery of the Emancipation Proclamation.

Wells moved to Tennessee and became a teacher in adulthood. Wells began to write political articles after she won a lawsuit against the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad in 1887 for being forcibly removed from a first-class train car she paid for; that decision was ultimately overturned by the Tennessee Supreme Court, Mississippi History reports.

Wells later moved to Chicago and took on a leadership role at the NAACP.

Wells went on to write exposés about school segregation and lynching in Memphis until she was forced to move to New York City for her safety. She continued her investigative reports about disparities in the American education system under segregation, mistreatment that African Americans experienced, and the road to women’s suffrage.

Some of her famous written works include ""Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in All Its Phases"" (1893) and ""Mob Rule in New Orleans"" (1900).

Wells later moved to Chicago and took on a leadership role at the NAACP. She also ran for the Illinois legislature before her death in 1931.

6. W. E. B. Du Bois

American sociologist and historian William Edward Burghardt Du Bois was born on Feb. 23, 1868, in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. Du Bois was the first Black graduate of Searles High School in 1884 and later earned his bachelor of arts from Fisk University in Tennessee, America’s Library reports.

He then earned a second bachelor’s degree, a master's and a doctorate in history from Harvard University. During his schooling, Du Bois also traveled to Germany for a fellowship at the University of Berlin, where he studied the works of famous social scientists, including Gustav von Schmoller and Heinrich von Treitschke.

Du Bois became a founding member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), America’s oldest and largest civil rights organization.

Du Bois used his education and talents as a writer and editor to address race relations in the U.S. and advance rights for Black Americans. He published 16 books on sociology, history and politics, including ""Black Reconstruction in America,"" ""The Souls of Black Folk"" and ""The Talented Tenth.""

Du Bois became a professor of history, sociology and economics at Atlanta University, a historically Black research college with Methodist roots. He also became a founding member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), America’s oldest and largest civil rights organization.

The NAACP characterizes itself as a grassroots organization that ""builds Black political power to end structural racism.""

Thurgood Marshall, the first African American appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court, was born on July 2, 1908, in Baltimore.

He was formerly named Thoroughgood Marshall, but he legally changed his name at the age of 6. Marshall later became interested in the law as a high school student after he was ordered to read the U.S. Constitution as a punishment for a prank he pulled, United States Courts reports.

From that moment, he was inspired to become a lawyer after he realized not all African Americans were able to enjoy the liberties laid out in the Bill of Rights.

THURGOOD MARSHALL: EXPLORING HIS LIFE

Marshall attended Lincoln University and then Howard University School of Law, where he worked with the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund. Around 1935, Marshall found counterarguments for segregation when he reviewed the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), which stated facilities could be divided by race if they were ""separate but equal.""

Marshall found that this doctrine was flawed and created discrepancies in the education children received, which led him to take on and win several landmark cases.

His most famous case that changed the American school system was Brown v. Board of Education (1954), which declared that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional.

President Kennedy appointed Marshall as a federal judge to the U.S. Court of Appeals in 1961. Four years later, Marshall was appointed as solicitor general by President Johnson. By 1967, Johnson appointed Marshall to the Supreme Court — where he served as a justice until 1991.

Civil rights leader Rosa Parks was born on Feb. 4, 1913, in Tuskegee, Alabama, under the name Rosa Louise McCauley. She married her husband Raymond Parks in 1932 and worked as a seamstress before she became a member of the Montgomery National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the National Parks Service reports.

At age 42, Parks was arrested for refusing to give up her seat at the front of a bus to a White passenger and move to the back, a practice that wasn’t uncommon during the time of Jim Crow.

The arrest inspired 17,000 African Americans to start the Montgomery Bus Boycott, which lasted for 13 months and hurt the city bus service’s revenue. Parks remained a symbol of resilience during this time.

The boycott finally came to an end in 1956 when the Supreme Court ruled that segregated buses were unconstitutional. Parks moved to Detroit a year later, working with the NAACP and Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., to fight homelessness, and even created a job training institute.

She earned a Congressional Gold Medal of Honor in 1991.

9. Shirley Chisholm

Shirley Chisholm, the first African American woman to serve in the United States Congress, was born in Brooklyn, New York, on Nov. 30, 1924, under the name Shirley Anita St. Hill.

In her youth, Chisholm was partially raised by her grandparents in Barbados before her family settled in Brooklyn for good, the U.S. House of Representatives reports.

Chisholm earned a bachelor's degree in sociology from Brooklyn College and a master's in elementary education from Columbia University. She worked as a teacher, daycare center director and educational consultant before entering politics.

Chisholm was elected to the New York state legislature in 1964 and then the U.S. House of Representatives in 1968, when she represented Brooklyn’s Bedford-Stuyvesant district for seven terms. Chisholm made waves in the House when she appealed her initial committee assignment in agriculture to find a committee more relevant to her district.

She was reassigned to the Veterans Affairs Committee and moved up to the Education and Labor Committee, where she dedicated herself to advancing equal education and employment opportunities. In 1972, Chisholm, a Democrat, also became the first African American to run for a major political party's nomination for president.

Civil rights leader Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was born on Jan. 15, 1929, in Atlanta. Post-college, King dedicated his life to fighting racial inequality with peaceful resistance to unjust laws.

He notably protested segregation in public schools, restaurants and hotels with nonviolent sit-ins, America’s Library reports. King also delivered moving speeches that challenged the mistreatment that African Americans faced under Jim Crow laws and called for equality.

King delivered his most famous speech, ""I Have a Dream,"" on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial during the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.

King's notable accomplishments during the Civil Rights Movement (1954-1968) included the Montgomery Bus Boycott; pleading for peace when U.S. marshals were called in to disperse the Freedom Riders (segregation protesters riding on interracial buses) in Montgomery; and leading the Voting Rights March from Selma to Montgomery, which was met with violent resistance.

10 facts about Black History Month that are well worth knowing during observances in February,"Every February, the nation celebrates Black History Month by honoring the contributions African Americans have made throughout history, while also recognizing that the fight for racial justice continues.

Previously, the theme for Black History Month was Black Health and Wellness, as outlined by the Association for the Study of African American Life and History (ASALH), which is headquartered in Washington, D.C. This year, the association has announced the month's theme is ""Black resistance"" with a planned virtual festival hosted by the association throughout February.

""African Americans have resisted historic and ongoing oppression, in all forms, especially the racial terrorism of lynching, racial pogroms and police killings since our arrival upon these shores,"" said the ASALH in a statement.

BLACK HISTORY IS AMERICAN HISTORY

""These efforts have been to advocate for a dignified self-determined life in a just democratic society in the United States and beyond the United States political jurisdiction,"" added the association.

Scores of events across the country – in cities, communities, college campuses and more – are scheduled for this month.

10 key facts about Black History Month

1. The current population of Black and African Americans is 46.9 million, the U.S. Census Bureau reports. Also, 89.4% of African Americans age 25 and older had a high school diploma or higher in 2020, as Fox10 Phoenix reported.

2. A founder of ASALH, Carter G. Woodson, first had the idea of celebrating Black history. Woodson was born in 1875 to newly freed Virginia slaves. He later earned a Ph.D. in history from Harvard University. He worried that Black children were not being taught about their ancestors’ achievements in American schools in the early 1900s, as Fox 10 noted.

3. By the late 1960s, Negro History Week – the precursor for this month's celebrations and events – changed into what is now known as Black History Month. In February 1969, a group of Black activist students and teachers at Kent State conducted the first celebration of Black History Month. Within a decade, Black social and cultural institutions throughout the country were celebrating the month, and by 1976, President Gerald Ford officially recognized it.

4. The month of February was picked for Black History Month because it contained the birthdays of President Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass. Lincoln was born on Feb. 12, and Douglass, a former slave who did not know his precise birthday, celebrated his date of birth on Feb. 14, Fox 10 also noted.

MEET THE AMERICAN WHO FIRST RECORDED THE BLUES, NATION'S ORIGINAL POP DIVA MAMIE SMITH

5. ASALH has celebrated Negro History Week and Black History Month for 96 years. Woodson, along with the association, announced in 1926 that the second week of February would commemorate the achievements of Black Americans. Initially, prominent Black leaders and newspapers supported the idea, and some education centers along the East Coast observed the monthly celebration.

6. Fifty years after the first celebrations, President Gerald R. Ford officially recognized Black History Month at the country's 1976 bicentennial. Ford called on Americans to ""seize the opportunity to honor the too-often neglected accomplishments of Black Americans in every area of endeavor throughout our history,"" as History.com noted.

WORDS MY UNCLE, MARTIN LUTHER KING JR., WOULD SHARE IN OUR TROUBLED TIMES

7. Forty years after Ford's recognition of Black History Month, President Barack Obama delivered this message, in part, from the White House: ""Black History Month shouldn't be treated as though it is somehow separate from our collective American history or somehow just boiled down to a compilation of greatest hits from the March on Washington or from some of our sports heroes… It's about the lived, shared experience of all African Americans.""

8. Canada also commemorates Black History Month in February. Although Black Canadians are approximately 3.5% of the country's total population, community leaders and activists still celebrate the historical achievements of the Black community. Canadian politicians Jean Augustine and Donald Oliver were instrumental in getting Black History Month officially recognized in the country by 2008.

9. At the time of Negro History Week's launch in 1926, Woodson believed the teaching of Black history was key to the physical and intellectual survival of the race: ""If a race has no history, it has no worthwhile tradition, it becomes a negligible factor in the thought of the world, and it stands in danger of being exterminated,"" he said in part, as the Journal of Negro History reported.

"At Queen Elizabeth II's funeral, female mourners likely to wear black veils: Here's what it means","Queen Elizabeth II, England's longest reigning monarch, died on Sept. 8 at age 96.

She is now lying in state at Westminster Hall, and her coffin will remain there until the morning of her funeral on Monday.

Ahead of the queen's funeral, female members of the royal family have been spotted wearing mourning veils as they attend various events in honor of the late queen.

A mourning veil is worn by someone who is grieving as a symbol of sorrow.

QUEEN ELIZABETH II: 10 FACTS AND STANDOUT MOMENTS FROM THE BRITISH MONARCH'S LIFE

Unlike other religious head coverings, which typically sit atop the head and cascade down the hair, mourning veils also cover the face of the wearer, the BBC pointed out.

Most mourning veils are made of a dark-colored lace or netting and are nearly transparent.

In the case of Queen Elizabeth II, it is tradition for bereaved family members of the royal family to wear a mourning veil to a state funeral, the BBC noted.

Mourning veils, however, are not just limited to royalty.

First lady Jacqueline Kennedy famously wore a mourning veil during President John F. Kennedy’s funeral and funeral procession in Washington, D.C., in November 1963.

QUEEN ELIZABETH II'S ICONIC FASHION REVEALED, FROM HER BRIGHTLY COLORED DRESSES TO HER SIGNATURE HANDBAG

While female religious head coverings are commonly associated with brides, vowed religious sisters and followers of Islam or Orthodox Judaism, there is a longstanding tradition of everyday Christian women covering their heads during worship, according to the Gospel Coalition, a faith website.

Mourning veils have unique symbolism and meaning dating back to the Bible's New Testament days, said Lily Wilson, owner of Veils by Lily in Kimmswick, Missouri.

""In 1 Corinthians 11, the apostle Paul instructs the early church at Corinth that women should cover their heads when praying or prophesying.""

Christian adherents to head coverings cite the Bible verse 1 Corinthians 11 as their reason for covering their heads, Wilson told Fox News Digital in a phone interview.

""In 1 Corinthians 11, the apostle Paul instructs the early church at Corinth that women should cover their heads when praying or prophesying,"" she said.

""This instruction goes along with others meant to correct certain practices by the faithful during the early liturgy of the breaking of the bread, which was being carried out according to the command left by the Lord on the night before he died.""

QUEEN ELIZABETH II'S FAVORITE DRINK WAS REPORTEDLY GIN AND DUBONNET: RECIPE

Christian veiling largely fell out of practice ""around the 1960s"" among Catholic and mainline Protestant denominations, Wilson explained.

However, it has started to make a comeback.

""In recent years, some Christian women have returned to the practice, especially in conservative Catholic parishes and certain Christian denominations,"" she said.

This includes the wearing of mourning veils at funerals.

""Customers who requested [mourning veils] appeared to be drawn to the privacy afforded by the lace that covered their faces,"" Wilson said.

""In years past, moreso than today, it was seen as undesirable to show emotion in public.""

Mourning veils ""served the dual purpose of giving privacy to the wearer in their mourning and covering the head according to the instructions of St. Paul in 1 Corinthians 11.""

The Rev. Jeffrey Kirby, pastor of Our Lady of Grace Parish in Indian Land, South Carolina, said in an email interview with Fox News Digital that the Bible teaches that ""a women’s hair is her glory.""

When a woman was in public during biblical times, ""she veiled her hair as a sign of modesty and, if married, as a sign of love and respect to her husband,"" he said.

""Veils today can be worn, but they are not obligatory,"" he added. ""Some women who wear veils insist on other women wearing them, but Saint Paul’s counsel was limited to the Corinthians, perhaps because of a lack of morals [in Corinth].

""He did not ask for veils to be worn in other Christian communities. Today, when veils are ceremonially worn by women, it is a sign of esteem to the other person. When veils are worn at funerals, it is a traditional and uniquely feminine act of deference to the person who has died.""

For Wilson, veiling is ""spiritually significant and enriching for our worship of God.""

An evening dress from the 1890s worn by ""history’s most famous mourner,"" Queen Victoria, was made of black taffeta and accompanied by a veil, according to the BBC.

ABC's 'The View' goes off the rails as Sunny Hostin calls Black Republicans an 'oxymoron',"ABC's liberal daytime gabfest ""The View"" went off the rails Friday as co-host Sunny Hostin referred to Black Republicans as an ""oxymoron"" and said she didn't understand how any Blacks or Latinos could be in the GOP.

During a segment focused on the potential conflict of interest between newly tapped White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre and her partner, CNN reporter Suzanne Malveaux, Hostin, co-host Ana Navarro and guest co-host Lindsey Granger broke into an all out war of words, as the former declared she didn't understand Black or Latino Republicans.

The segment began with the co-hosts debating whether it was a potential issue for Jean-Pierre and Malveaux to be in their respective positions given their relationship.

Navarro, Hostin and co-host Sara Haines pushed back on the notion that it created a conflict of interest; however, Granger argued it was necessary to be realistic ""about what happens when you're in bed with somebody,"" and that people didn't want to see situations where the media gives a politician an advantage.

The conversation broke down when Navarro pushed back on Granger, declaring that the ability for people with a relationship to work in government and the media without acting unethically was ""a novel idea"" for a supporter of former President Donald Trump.

Granger declared that she didn't agree with everything Trump did and that she was ""a Black woman first.""

""Are you a Republican?"" Hostin asked Granger, to which she confirmed she was.

""I feel like it's an oxymoron, a Black Republican,"" Hostin said, interrupting her.

""Why? Your friend right here is a Republican,"" Granger shot back, referring to Ana Navarro, who identifies as a Republican, although she's now a diehard Democratic supporter and even worked for Joe Biden's 2020 campaign.

Granger referenced Hostin's previous admittance to being a Catholic and disagreeing with abortion, but also advocating for abortion to be legal.

""I don't understand either of you,"" Hostin said, again interrupting Granger.

""No you don't understand yourself then,"" Granger retorted.

""I don't understand either of you,"" Hostin repeated. ""I don't understand Black Republicans and I don't understand Latino Republicans.""

African-American studies professor decries 'legacies of slavery' that prevented Black QBs at the Super Bowl,"Gustavus Adolphus College professor Kare Aguilar penned a Washington Post op-ed on Sunday celebrating the milestone of two Black quarterbacks playing at the Super Bowl while also attacking the ""legacies of slavery"" inherent in the game.

The African-American History professor, who is White, published her piece hours before the big gam insisting that ""ideas dating back to slavery have minimized opportunities for Black quarterbacks in the NFL.""

""The matchup between [Patrick] Mahomes and [Jalen] Hurts has been decades in the making, as Black players, including these quarterbacks, have worked to bust century-old myths surrounding Black people, athletes, intellect and leadership that have historically prevented Black players from getting a chance at quarterback in the NFL,"" Aguilar wrote.

According to Aguilar, Mahomes of the Kansas City Chiefs and Hurts of the Philadelphia Eagles also marked the eighth and ninth Black quarterback to play at the Super Bowl with the first winning Black quarterback, Doug Williams, playing in 1988.

FOX SPORTS’ CHRIS MYERS ON WHAT TO EXPECT DURING SUPERBOWL LVII BETWEEN THE EAGLES AND CHIEFS

As the piece continued, Aguilar began connecting the lack of Black Super Bowl quarterbacks to slavery itself.

""To justify slavery and the transatlantic trade of enslaved people, Europeans — and later Americans — asserted that Black people were built for labor. Proponents of slavery argued that biological differences between Black and White Americans necessitated separation and social control. They also developed ideas about the intellectual superiority of Whites, as well as their supposed greater fitness to lead,"" she wrote.

Aguilar continued, ""These beliefs shaped the development of football in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and later the NFL, which formed in 1920. Initially, the league had a few Black players, but by 1933, they were banned, with no Black players allowed in the NFL between 1933 and 1946. While the league began integrating in the 1940s, it was not until 1962 that the last team, what is now the Washington Commanders, desegregated.""

SUPER BOWL LVII: KELCE BROTHERS’ HIGH SCHOOL COACH DETAILS DUO’S ‘COMPETITIVE’ NATURE AHEAD OF FINAL GAME

However, she noted, integration ""did not mean equal opportunity for Black and White players"" and that ""racist ideas about innate differences between the races"" persisted to force Black players out of the quarterback position and still continue to this day.

""This brings us to the meaning of Super Bowl LVII. The game offers an opportunity to see sports as a stage for examining our beliefs and putting them in their proper historical and cultural context. In this case, it is a stark reminder of how the legacies of slavery and the racist ideas underpinning it continue to affect American society,"" Aguilar wrote. ""That story can help fans better understand how slavery — and the noxious, racist ideas that came with it — still affect how we see race, sports and leadership in the 21st century. If this happens, regardless of which team wins, this Super Bowl will be a victory for all who watch it.""

The NFL has announced numerous initiatives to combat what they called ""systemic racism."" For the third year in a row, the league will feature a rendition of ""Lift Every Voice and Sing,"" a song that has been dubbed the ""Black National Anthem,"" prior to the Super Bowl game.

Black California doctor torches mandatory implicit bias training: 'Appalled',"Marilyn Singleton, a visiting fellow from the medical organization Do No Harm, penned an opinion piece for the Washington Post attacking recent focus on ""implicit bias training"" in her field.

She explained Wednesday ""I’m a Black physician, and I’m appalled by mandated implicit bias training"" as she has been required by the state of California to take part in racialized ""education"" that she had not seen since graduating in 1973.

""That racial obsession has come rushing back — in academia, politics, business and even in my beloved medical profession. But now it’s coming from the opposite direction. The malignant false assumption that Black people are inherently inferior intellectually has been traded in for the malignant false assumption that White people are inherently racist,"" Singleton wrote.

Various states, including California, have recently enacted an ""implicit bias"" training course within the medical field. Singleton explained that the law in her state took effect last year and requires at least 50 hours of ""continuing medical education"" every two years in order to be granted medical license renewal. Although the deadline to complete these hours for Singleton is the end of 2023, she revealed that she has yet to take part in any training.

PROFESSOR LAMBASTES WHITE PEOPLE AS ‘DAMAGING’ WHO NEED TO DISMANTLE THEIR ‘WHITENESS’

""My answer is simple. I reject the unscientific accusation that people are defined by their race, not by their individual beliefs and choices. It is little consolation that studies are finding implicit bias training has no effect on its intended targets, and might even make matters worse,"" Singleton argued.

She specifically attacked the training’s insistence that Black physicians such as herself should always be wary of her White colleagues by suggesting that ""bias is always going to be there, beneath the surface, threatening to rear its ugly, racist head.""

""The message to physicians is bad enough, but the message to patients is much worse,"" Singleton continued. ""Black people are, in effect, being told that White physicians are likely to quite literally damage our health. If that’s the case, why on earth would you seek medical care, unless you could be absolutely certain of not being treated by a White physician? And if you do seek medical care, why wouldn’t you doubt every word from a White doctor who is inherently prejudiced against you?""

PHYSICIANS LIKE ME AREN’T RACIST, NO MATTER WHAT THE GOVERNMENT SAYS

""The whole point of implicit bias training is to create better health outcomes for Black patients and others who might be the target of discrimination, but the opposite seems more likely,"" she said in closing. ""It fosters a climate of distrust and resentment that threatens to undermine the medical and moral progress I’ve seen over the decades. When I graduated from medical school, we were moving past the era of racial obsession and anger. Why are we going back to the days when race defined so many lives and dimmed so many futures?""

Medical practitioners in various states have called out ""implicit bias"" training and have even lost their jobs over their refusal to take part in the courses.

Black Rifle Coffee Company responds to critics after partnership with Dallas Cowboys caused stir,"Black Rifle Coffee Company had a ready response when the NFL's Dallas Cowboys irked liberals over its partnership with the military veteran-backed coffee company, following a series of tragic mass shootings that put American gun ownership under a microscope.

The coffee company, which features images of guns and American flags on its packaging, works closely with veterans, law enforcement and first responders and is largely operated by veterans themselves. On Tuesday, the Cowboys announced a new partnership by tweeting, ""#CowboysNation, please welcome America’s Coffee to America’s Team.""

However, some didn’t appreciate the Cowboys announcing a deal with a gun-themed coffee company on the heels of mass shootings in Highland Park, Ill., and Uvalde, Texas, including some liberal sports journalists.

COWBOYS AGREE TO PARTNERSHIP WITH BLACK RIFLE COFFEE COMPANY, MET WITH MIXED REVIEWS

A Cowboys beat writer for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram called the team ""tone deaf,"" and the football team’s Twitter account was flooded with criticism that was highlighted across the media.

""Eighteen hours after the July 4 shooting in Illinois, the Dallas Cowboys announced a partnership with a company called Black Rifle Coffee, which sells a brand called AK Espresso,"" sports business reporter Darren Rovell tweeted.

Left-wing sports site Deadspin fretted over the Cowboys showing a ""shocking-yet-predictable level of self-awareness.""

The coffee company is pushing back on criticism by noting the good work it's done since U.S. Army veteran Evan Hafer founded the company in 2014.

HIGHLAND PARK FOURTH OF JULY PARADE SHOOTING VICTIMS IDENTIFIED: WHO WERE THEY?

""Last year we donated over $1.2M in cash to charitable organizations and $3M worth of coffee and products to active military and first responder units. Thus far, in 2022, the Black Rifle Coffee Company and the Black Rifle Coffee Fund have donated over a million dollars in cash, coffee and products to such organizations, including The Gary Sinise Foundation, Semper Fi Fund, Hunter Seven Foundation, Global War On Terror Memorial Fund, and the FDNY Foundation,"" a Black Rifle Coffee Company spokesperson told Fox News Digital.

VETERAN-OWNED BLACK RIFLE COFFEE GOES PUBLIC ON NYSE

Retired NFL linebacker Jarret Johnson, a Black Rifle Coffee franchisee, also spoke out about the controversy.

""I’m proud to be a Black Rifle Coffee franchisee. My business partner is a special operations veteran and we both get a lot of satisfaction from being part of a company that does so much for the veteran community. It’s great to see the Cowboys supporting veterans by partnering with Black Rifle Coffee,"" Johnson told Fox News Digital. ""I'd love for more NFL teams to join them.""

Last month, President Biden signed into law the most sweeping gun control bill in nearly 30 years after two mass shootings in Buffalo, New York, and Uvalde, Texas, left dozens dead within a week of each other. Since then, the July 4 mass shooting at a Fourth of July parade in Highland Park left seven dead and further intensified the national debate over gun control.

Hafer started Black Rifle Coffee in his Salt Lake City garage in 2014. Prior to that, he spent about 300 days a year, for a decade, deployed to some of the most remote and hostile regions of the world, with both the U.S. special forces and the CIA.

Today, Black Rifle Coffee is one of the most successful veteran-owned businesses in America.

"Florida rejects AP African American course that contained elements of CRT, 'Black Queer Studies'","The state of Florida Department of Education (DOE) rejected an Advanced Placement (AP) African Studies Course because it lacks educational value and historical accuracy, according to a letter sent to the College Board by the state.

""As submitted, the course is a vehicle for a political agenda and leaves large, ambiguous gaps that can be filled with additional ideological material, which we will not allow,"" Bryan Griffin, press secretary to Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said in a statement. ""As Governor DeSantis has stated, our classrooms will be a place for education, not indoctrination.""

The course contains tenets of Critical Race Theory (CRT) and elements of queer theory, according to a copy of the syllabus obtained by Fox News Digital.

TAMPA RESIDENTS SPEAK OUT AGAINST SCHOOL DISTRICT'S SEX ED CURRICULUM, CALLS FOR IT TO BE REMOVED

A section of the course, titled ""African American Studies: Movements and Methods,"" includes a lesson on ""Black Queer Studies"" that teaches students about ""the concept of the queer of color critique, grounded in Black feminism and intersectionality, as a Black studies lens that shifts sexuality studies toward racial analysis,"" according to the syllabus.

""As presented, the content of this course is inexplicably contrary to Florida law and significantly lacks educational value,"" the DOE rejection letter said.

The College Board said the course is in development and being piloted at 60 high schools across the U.S., before it is expanded nationwide by 2025, according to its website. The course has been in development for more than a decade with the help of ""college faculty and teachers across the country"" whose ""expertise and experience"" will provide the basis for ""an evidence-based introduction to African American studies.""

Florida teacher on leave after accusation he had White students bow to Black students in his classroom,"A Florida teacher who was accused of having White students in his classroom bow to Black students is on leave.

Ethan Hooper, a middle school teacher in Orlando, posted the videos to his personal social media which went viral after being shared by the popular right-wing account Libs of TikTok.

One of the videos Hooper posted showed White students acting like servants to Black students in the class in honor of Black History Month. White students were shown in the video fanning and feeding Black students.

""It was in good fun. There was no political agenda behind it,"" the teacher said. He said the video was being ""maliciously used.""

If this does not match up with what they viewed [of me], I am truly sorry. My heart is for my students and the parents, first and foremost.""

The Orange County Public School District issued a statement saying that it will ""not tolerate the use of our children as political pawns by anyone, including a classroom teacher.

Former Black Panther Angela Davis shocked to learn she is a descendant of the Mayflower,"Racial activist and former fugitive Angela Davis was shocked to learn she is a Mayflower descendent on Tuesday's episode of ""Finding Your Roots"" on PBS.

Davis is notorious for working with the Communist Party USA and the Black Panther Party in the 1960s and 70s. Her involvement in the armed takeover of a California courtroom resulted in four deaths and her placement on the FBI's Most Wanted List.

Now 79, Davis was the latest to appear on the PBS show where celebrities and public figures learn about their ancestry.

Near the end of the episode, after discussing multiple members of her family, the former Black Panther learned she descended from William Brewster, one of the 101 people who came to the colonies in 1620 aboard the Mayflower.

""Our researchers discovered #AngelaDavis’s ancestors traveled to the US on the Mayflower and here is her reaction. #FindingYourRoots,"" he tweeted.

""Do you know what you’re looking at? That is a list of the passengers on the Mayflower,"" Gates asked Davis in the video.

""No, I can't believe this,"" Davis replied, laughing. ""No, my ancestors did not come here on the Mayflower.""

She continued to protest while Gates confirmed the findings then responded, ""Oof. That’s a little bit too much to deal with right now.""

""Would you ever in your wildest dreams think that you may have been descended from the people who laid the foundation of this country?"" he asked.



""Never, never, never, never, never,"" she said.

Twitter users across the political spectrum expressed surprise or fascination at the revelation as well.

Gov. Youngkin rips Black Lives Matter curriculum as ‘politically-driven',"Gov. Glenn Youngkin, R., blasted a curriculum pushed by a program associated with the Black Lives Matter movement, according to a report.

The Virginia Education Association (VEA), a teachers union, released a toolkit that pushes an initiative called the Black Lives Matter at School Week of Action, an event started by teachers in Seattle in 2016. The event is a week-long focus on the 13 Guiding Principles of the Black Lives Matter movement in schools which is set for Feb. 6-10 this year.

The organization’s 13 principles include ""transgender affirming,"" ""queer affirming,"" ""restorative justice"" and ""globalism.""

TEXAS A&M COURSE ASSIGNS BOOK THAT RIPS TRUMP: ‘WELCOME TO THE REALITY-BASED COMMUNITY'

The VEA’s director of human and civil rights released a statement with the toolkit saying ""Enclosed is Virginia Education Association’s Black Lives Matter at School Toolkit to be used as a resource guide for advancing racial justice in Virginia’s schools. Black Lives Matter at School is a national coalition organizing for racial justice in education.""

They added, ""All educators, students, parents, unions, and community organizations are encouraged to join their annual week of action during the first week of February.""

Youngkin’s office said the VEA is trying ""inject politically-driven curriculum"" in schools.

PROFESSOR ARGUES MATH EDUCATION IS WHITE AND CISHETEROPATRIARCHAL SPACE, 'LIMITS' QUEER AND STUDENTS OF COLOR

""Gov. Youngkin is empowering parents, restoring excellence in education, and has removed critical race theory from Virginia’s schools,"" Youngkin spokeswoman Macaulay Porter told The Daily Signal. ""The VEA—the same union that kept schools shuttered and students at home during the pandemic—is now attempting to inject a politically-driven curriculum toolkit in an effort to teach kids to discriminate against one another based off their color, gender, race, or background.""

""This will not be tolerated,"" she added.

The controversial lens expressed in the training is called critical race theory , which holds that America is and was always structurally racist; CRT adds that the U.S. was designed from its start to systematically oppress minority groups in order to uphold systems of power for the dominant culture or White racial group. CRT also maintains an oppressor versus oppressed lens of society and classifies people into groups based on supposed ""privilege.""

MARYLAND SCHOOL DISTRICT GIVES KIDS WORKSHEET ABOUT THEIR LEVEL OF PRIVILEGE OR OPPRESSION

Among the nine executive orders Youngkin signed on his first day of office, was ending the use of Critical Race Theory in schools and appointing an education secretary who would remove ""politics from the classroom.""

Youngkin's first appointment to his administration was education secretary, Aimee Rogstad Guidera. He said at the time that she ""will be a critical partner in restoring expectations of excellence … and standing for a curriculum that prepares Virginia’s children for a dynamic future and removes politics from the classroom.""

Critical Race Theory was also a key issue in the race with Youngkin responding to complaints about the controversial curriculum being embedded in Virginia schools by promising to remove it and give parents a larger say in what is taught to their children. Youngkin's opponent, former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, dismissed parent concerns telling them that Critical Race Theory was not being taught and saying, ""I don’t think parents should be telling schools what they should teach.""

Why Black Americans are leaving Biden in droves,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

It should come as no surprise that Black Americans are ditching the Biden administration in droves. The recent exodus of 21 Black staffers, which has been dubbed ""Blaxit,"" should be a warning sign to Democrats that instead of playing the race card, they should tackle the issues that actually matter to Black Americans – starting with inflation and crime.

Contrary to the spin coming out of the White House, the departure of 21 Black staffers – with more expected in the coming weeks – is not something that can just be brushed off as a coincidence or a normal part of the political cycle. The fact that the White House is trying to treat this as being inconsequential just underscores the root of the problem – the Biden administration is happy to have Black votes on Election Day, but doesn’t actually care about our interests.

The same pattern plays out again and again. Team Biden is presented with evidence of an impending catastrophe that is likely to devastate the Black community, and they either scoff at the idea that it’s a problem, or attempt to shift the blame onto someone else.

WASHINGTON POST OP-ED ASKS IF IT'S TIME FOR BLACK PEOPLE TO 'FLEE THE COUNTRY'

When prices first started rising at the gas pump and in grocery stores, President Joe Biden and his advisers insisted that inflation would be a ""transitory"" phenomenon – nothing to worry about. Now that inflation has been at a 40-year high for several months in a row, and working families are struggling to fill their tanks and put food on the table, they’re trying to convince us that the real culprit is not their own reckless policies, but COVID-related supply chain issues and Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.

A similar story is playing out with the critical shortage of baby formula, which is now starting to put vulnerable children in the hospital with malnutrition. Black mothers rely more heavily on baby formula than White mothers, and low-income families are being disproportionately harmed by the ongoing formula shortage. Biden doesn’t seem to care. All he’s done is put band-aids on the problem, hoping to convince the American public that his administration has things under control, even as the shelves remain bare and desperate parents travel for hours in search of the food their children need to survive.

And then, of course, there’s the ongoing epidemic of violent crime that is devastating America’s cities. For a year and a half, the Biden administration has ignored the problem. Sure, they’re happy to politicize a tragedy such as a school shooting in order to push their gun-control agenda, but where are they when Blacks are being routinely gunned down in the inner cities? Over Memorial Day weekend, there were at least 14 mass shootings across the country, and more than 50 people were shot in Chicago alone.

Biden loves to talk about ""White supremacy"" as a bogeyman, but the vast majority of the violence being inflicted on Black Americans has nothing to do with White supremacy, and everything to do with his own party’s failed soft-on-crime policies .

I speak from personal experience on this subject. Over 30 years ago, I lost my right leg as the result of a gunshot wound. Some of the people I work with have had similar experiences. Instead of putting our trust in self-interested politicians like Biden, we dedicated ourselves to actually doing something to make life better for our fellow Americans.

Instead of trying to drive God out of our society, we embrace Christian messages of love, empathy, and understanding. Instead of making people dependent on government handouts to live, we help them become self-sufficient so they can provide for themselves and their families. Instead of viewing the Constitution as outdated or anachronistic, we recognize that it provides the blueprint for the greatest form of government that has ever existed.

Biden doesn’t understand any of that, and that’s part of the reason why he’s so out of touch with the needs and concerns of black Americans.

Black history is American history,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

Every February, America acknowledges Black History Month. Consequently, a recurring debate emerges, the question being, ""why do we need to set aside this calendar occurrence?"" My America First Policy Institute colleague Ken Blackwell gives a pertinent response: Black history is American history.

Meanwhile, today American life faces an ongoing challenging yet not insurmountable reality; purveyors of division constantly weaponize a false racial premise by equating racial identification to skin color, all in a cynical effort to divide our communities.

WORDS MY UNCLE, MARTIN LUTHER KING JR., WOULD SHARE IN OUR TROUBLED TIMES

Of course, ""skin color racism"" has no scientific basis, nor is it relevant to the human persona. Nevertheless, the perpetrators of this dogma of division push even further toward a dangerously erroneous conclusion: America is the worst place for Blacks and other minorities to live. This outlook is false and dangerous — and it betrays the very principles the greatest Nation on earth was founded upon.

Reflections

Where did the term ""people of color"" originate, anyway? All human pigmentation has some hue. Nobody’s skin is the exact color of a sheet of copy paper or a lump of coal. When we continue to search for different euphemisms to define — and therefore box in — the Black community, we overlook the simple scientific and spiritual truth that there is only one race, the human race.

While skin color may denote ethnic origins in some cases, skin color does not determine the ""race"" of the human species. To state the truth clearly, there is only one human race. By turning skin color into a lightning rod of division, we are turning a blind eye to the God-given gift of ethnicity.

Perhaps my uncle, the patriot, and preacher Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s dream gives insight:

""I still have a dream. It is deeply rooted in the American dream. I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.""

Thankfully, a majority of Americans all across the country understand that the racial divisions being foisted on our young people are wrong. America’s parents are waking up as they refuse to stand for this indoctrination.

This awakening is one reason why the Liberals falsely represented Critical Race Theory decision lost in some 2021 elections, as parents and students voted to ensure that American principles won out. Truth must be shouted from the rooftops in every decade and generation. In this sense, it is important for all Americans to deeply understand all of our history — the good, the bad, and the ugly — from the womb to the tomb.

""To define each of us by our race is nothing short of a denial of humanity."" Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas said.

The American Dream is built upon the idea of ""cradle to grave"" opportunity for all Americans — and this includes protecting life when it begins in the womb.

Further, the politically-charged effort to replace ""equality"" with ""equity"" is a grave threat to the American Dream. The shift to ""equity"" leads us away from the very words of our own founders, that ""All men [humans, male and female] are created equal.

""…And hath made of one blood all nations of men [humans, male and female] for to dwell on all the face of the earth…"" Acts 17:26 KJV

To legislate based on true equality means that we must treat all people the same, conferring equal moral value and human dignity on every regardless of ethnicity.

Conclusion

""Truth,"" said the poet William Cullen Bryant, ""crushed to earth shall rise again."" These words are an inspiration because they remind us that evil, falsehood, and deceit are ultimately ephemeral. Over time, lies inevitably crumble under their own weight. Yet the truth perseveres.

The truth of the matter is that we have too often turned a blind eye to the humanity of our brothers and sisters. It is time past for being colorblind. It is time to open our eyes and work together for justice and righteousness.

""…You will know the Truth, and the Truth will set you free."" John 8:32

Black History Month should remind us that we should never forget our past, yet moving ahead, our focus must be on uniting as one America. When we put aside our differences — from faith to politics, and yes, even to skin color — we can come together to uplift our brothers and sisters, giving everyone an equal opportunity to achieve the American Dream.

Black History Month is about more than just Black Americans,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

Black History Month is upon us. Some will attempt to use it as a tool to push divisive agendas such as critical race theory or Black Lives Matter.

But we must avoid such ideologies and remain focused on what unites us as a nation, regardless of our race. Indeed, it is wrong to assume that Black history must only involve Black Americans.

BLACK HISTORY THROUGH THE YEARS: 10 FAMOUS FIGURES IN THE US

Every moment of greatness in our history belongs to all Americans, because the fruits of those triumphs have blessed all of us. This applies to Washington crossing the Delaware, to the Constitutional Convention, and other events not typically acknowledged as Black history; these all belong to the Black story as well.

At the same time, there are both triumphs and tragedies that have been specific to the Black experience. The beautiful resistance against government tyranny that occurred at the Boston Tea Party was largely spurred by the killing of Black U.S. Army soldier Crispus Attucks by the British. Gospel, jazz and blues are beautiful, world unique musical forms that were born out of the Black experience in America. Let us celebrate those and other such triumphs during this month.

Yet, there are also tragedies that affect the Black population more than other groups. The crime rate is significantly higher, as is the prevalence of fatherless homes, sexually transmitted diseases, and discipline issues at school.

On top of that, there are problems not typically seen as racial issues which disproportionately impact Black Americans. Inflation, specifically of gas prices and housing prices, is one such problem. High gas prices are like regressive taxation, with the working class having to pay an increasing share of a smaller income just to get to and fro. The rapid rise in housing prices is crowding Black Americans out of the housing market.

As HUD secretary, I worked to address this problem by chairing the Council on Eliminating Regulatory Barriers to Affordable Housing. Illegal immigration – which suppresses wages – is harmful to all working-class Americans, including much of the Black population. That these issues are never framed as Black issues shows a failure of leadership on behalf of those who style themselves as leaders in the Black community.

This Black History Month let's shine a spotlight on fatherlessness and saving Black babies,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

Black History Month begins this week, just two weeks after tens of thousands of Americans gathered in Washington, D.C., for the 50th annual March for Life. This month and the March for Life collectively present an important opportunity to highlight two of the most pressing issues facing America’s Black community today: abortion and fatherlessness.

Ultimately, the reason these issues are widely accepted in the Black community is our country’s decline in church attendance and its move away from Jesus. Yet the sad reality of our times is that these issues receive little to no attention from the mainstream media or the far left today. Instead of focusing on these issues and working to develop solutions for them, the left and the media continue to promote ideas about ""systemic racism"" and critical race theory while calling for ever-expanding forms of ""racial equity."" Rather than responding to these distractions, we want to use this Black History Month to raise awareness about fatherlessness and abortion and the devastating effect both are having on America’s Black community.

Our Nation is home to approximately 24 million fatherless children, or about 1 in 3 of all American children. Approximately 80% of these homes are led by single mothers, and the rate of children living in single-parent households is the highest of any country in the world. Our Nation’s fatherlessness epidemic has particularly ravaged the Black community. Nearly 70% of all Black babies in America today are born to unmarried mothers, and 64% of all Black children grow up in a single-parent home.

10 FACTS ABOUT BLACK HISTORY MONTH THAT ARE WELL WORTH KNOWING DURING OBSERVANCES IN FEBRUARY

Tragically, fatherlessness strongly correlates with negative outcomes in nearly every aspect of a child’s life. Fatherless families are 25% more likely to raise a child in poverty, and 90% of all homeless and runaway children do not have a father. Additionally, 85% of children and teens with behavioral disorders come from fatherless homes. Fatherless children also account for 71% of child substance abuse cases, and approximately 70% of all youths in state-operated institutions are fatherless.

This Black History Month, we want to draw attention away from the noise and back to the issues that matter. The rampant fatherlessness and shocking rates of abortion in the Black community should be stunning to all Americans of good faith.

The issues of abortion and fatherlessness are closely linked, as one of every three pregnancies in a fatherlessness home end in abortion. America’s epidemic of fatherless children largely correlates with abortion rates, and women raised in fatherless homes account for approximately 70% of all teen pregnancies.

AMERICA'S CRISIS IS A LACK OF FATHERS

Equally tragic is the vastly disproportionate impact abortion has on the Black community. Of the roughly 930,000 abortions performed in 2020, about 39% were performed on Black women, for a rate of 24.4 abortions per 1,000 Black women. This means that over the course of a year, more than 350,000 Black babies, or almost 1,000 per day, are aborted. As a result, approximately 1 million Black babies are killed in the womb every three years.

Deep down, Americans understand that fatherhood is essential to society. According to a poll by Scott Rasmussen, 84% of Americans believe a strong family is foundational to a strong America.

Most Americans also understand the relationship between absent fathers and abortion. Sixty-nine percent of Americans think a man becomes a father at the moment of conception, and 78% think the father’s financial responsibility begins at the start of a pregnancy. The book of Malachi reflects this wisdom and reminds us that God ""will turn the hearts of the fathers to their children, and the hearts of the children to their fathers.""

This Black History Month, we want to draw attention away from the noise and back to the issues that matter. The rampant fatherlessness and shocking rates of abortion in the Black community should be stunning to all Americans of good faith, and we genuinely believe these two related issues are among the biggest civil rights battles of our time.

Fixing anything begins with first identifying the problem. The simple truth is that Black Americans will continue to struggle and fall behind if the fatherlessness crisis is not addressed.

At the same time, the effects of abortion on significant parts of the Black community will keep robbing our country of untold ingenuity and talent.

By highlighting fatherlessness and abortion this Black History Month, we can help the American people learn more about the biggest issues Black America faces. Then, and only then, can Americans of all stripes unite to solve them.

Rob Smith: Black Lives Matter doesn’t really care about Black lives lost unless group can blame police,"Black Lives Matter has become a major political force during this intense election year, getting favorable coverage in the left-wing media as its foot soldiers have been at the center of violent riots, looting, protests and other unrest breaking out in recent months. But while BLM claims to benefit Black Americans, the truth is that it actually hurts us.

BLM’s cult-like tactics are more like those of a violent gang than a traditional civil rights group fighting against racial discrimination. The organization refuses to acknowledge the Black lives lost in the violence it has engaged in. It refuses to acknowledge the tragedy of Black lives lost to criminals. It focuses solely on far smaller number of Black people injured or killed in encounters with police.

Growing numbers of Black Americans are starting to wake up to this hypocrisy. Do most Black people actually support Black Lives Matter? I address this question in the newest episode of my podcast “Rob Smith Is Problematic.”

DEMS DON’T HAVE ‘MORAL COURAGE’ TO CALL OUT BLM PROTESTERS HARASSING DINERS: ROB SMITH

BLM has established itself as the prism through which Blacks in America view ourselves — and is attempting to define us. The message we are getting is: if you are a Black American and you are not completely on board with every single thing that is done or said to advocate for this organization, then you are not Black, or you are not Black enough, or you hate yourself.

This is absurd.

I have a problem with this because there should be no organization or movement that has that much power over any group of people. I was born Black and will always be Black. No one has the right to tell me that my race requires me to support a certain group, cause, political ideology or candidate.

Just as White people have every right to hold a wide range of beliefs, Black people do as well. No race is monolithic.

Black Lives Matters supporters taking to the streets, screaming in the faces of white diners attempting to enjoy a meal outside, breaking into stores, looting, setting fires and engaging in other acts of physical violence aren’t movement members. They’re criminals. BLM is their cult. It is their religion. It is what gives them purpose. And that should make Americans of any color deeply uncomfortable.

BLM also traffics in “defund the police” rhetoric that sounds amazing to liberal elites who live in gated communities and luxury high-rises — but is far less appealing to Black people who live in crime-ridden communities.

Yes, structural issues and disparities in policing exist. Yes, some Black people have been unjustly injured and killed by police. And yes, any officer who engages in police brutality or unjustified violence toward anyone should be charged and prosecuted to the full extent the law allows.

But far more Black people have been protected by police from criminals than have been killed by police. So the question is: how do we fix the problems that have resulted in the wrongful treatment of some African Americans while at the same time offering protection to the vast majority of Black people, who are law-abiding citizens?

Black Lives Matters supporters taking to the streets, screaming in the faces of white diners attempting to enjoy a meal outside, breaking into stores, looting, setting fires and engaging in other acts of physical violence aren’t movement members. They’re criminals.

First, we need realistic and specific policy changes to prevent police misconduct toward anyone, including toward Black people. But defunding the police will not reduce police misconduct— it would actually hurt Black Americans far more than it would help us.

Defunding the police would result in police cutting the number of officers patrolling neighborhoods and responding to crimes. That’s great news for criminals of all races — it means they have a lower chance of being caught and can commit more crimes.

But defunding the police is terrible news for crime victims — and many crime victims are Black and live in low-income neighborhoods. A Black woman who is raped, a Black parent who sees a child shot and killed in a robbery, or a Black store owner who sees his business looted and burned are not going to rejoice because these crimes were committed by criminals rather than police officers.

Yet we see no BLM rallies and marches for Black crime victims, including murder victims. Don’t those Black lives matter? Where are the posters demanding justice for these people?

The truth is that the tragic loss of these Black lives can’t be used to further the radical BLM agenda, so the organizations ignores them.

Professional activists make money fundraising for Black Lives Matter. Black journalists are accepted in media circles as “authentic” because they don’t dare question BLM’s hypocrisy and victim narrative. Ambulance-chasing lawyers make millions off the pain of families reeling from the loss of relatives — a loss that is usually avoidable.

But Black Lives Matter does nothing to benefit the vast majority of Black Americans. It makes them hate police officers. It turns the real world into an alternate universe in which evil White cops are hunting them down the moment they leave the safety of their homes.

And BLM emboldens people who push ridiculous rhetoric and don’t care one bit that it makes the lives of average Black people — not rich entertainers, athletes and media personalities — more dangerous.

Black Lives Matter is here to stay. The many millions of dollars the organization has raised in the past few months will ensure that. The question is: who benefits?

Certainly not the Black cops trying to protect everyone in their communities, despite the insults they get and the risks they face of getting badly hurt or killed. Certainly not the people who see their communities becoming less safe because of anti-police rhetoric. And certainly not the families of the Black people murdered by criminals every day, who look at Black Lives Matter and wonder when the lives of their lost loved ones will matter as well.

Black patriotism in US history: Here is just one example to remember during Black History Month,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

As we begin Black History Month this February, Americans of all stripes would do well to remember that Black history is not something apart from American history, but simply another part of our great national story.

Unfortunately, in years past, Black History Month has been used as a cudgel to divide the American people based on race. All the sins from America’s past are highlighted, radical anti-American figures are elevated, extreme ideologies like critical race theory are pushed on our children, and some are even attempting to redefine the very date of America’s founding.

This year, I wanted to change the narrative by taking this opportunity to highlight just one lesser-known African American hero from our history and share his story as an example of patriotism and unity.

Peter Salem was born into slavery in Framingham, Massachusetts, in 1750 and lived there until age 25, when he was emancipated so he could enlist as a Massachusetts Minuteman. As a soldier, Salem fought in the very first engagements of the Revolutionary War through his participation in the Battle of Lexington and Concord with Col. John Nixon’s Fifth Massachusetts Regiment, which included several other African American soldiers.

THIS IS THE BIGGEST THREAT TO BLACK AMERICA. HINT: IT'S NOT THE POLICE

Later that year, Salem fought in the Battle of Bunker Hill and was widely credited with firing the shot that killed British Ma. John Pitcairn, which gave the fledgling Continental Army a much-needed morale boost early in the war.

Salem received a commendation from the Massachusetts General Court for his bravery at Bunker Hill, and then continued his service by reenlisting with the 4th Continental Regiment. During this time, he took part in the Battles of Harlem Heights and Trenton, and then the Battles of Saratoga, Monmouth and Stony Point after re-enlisting again.

After the Revolutionary War, Salem built a home in Leicester, Massachusetts, and struggled to get by while working as a weaver, gardener and chair repairman, struggling to earn a living. At the age of 66, Salem died in obscurity at a poorhouse back in Framingham.

Salem – like Crispus Attucks, Phyllis Wheatley, Titus Coburn and so many other Black patriots of the American Revolution – stood up for the cause of independence because they understood the very promise America represents. Though we failed to perfectly live up to those ideals at the time our nation was founded, American history is a story of a people striving to put into practice the foundational values they proclaimed, culminating in a Civil War.

African American history shouldn’t be set apart from American history, as so many commentators in the media would like us to believe. Instead, let’s reject the divisive labels and use this time to celebrate American history and the sacrifices our forefathers made to establish the greatest country on Earth.

Today, America remains the land of equality, liberty and opportunity for all. Our past isn’t perfect, but our story tells the tale of a people valiantly standing up for what they believe in. Our founding principles and the promises they hold have allowed each of us to grow up in a place where we are free to pursue our own American Dream.

Peter Salem answered that call, as did many others whose stories are known but to God. I think that’s something worth reflecting on this Black History Month.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/black-patriotism-us-history-here-just-one-example-remember-during-black-history-month,N/A
Do Black victims matter?,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

Editor's note: This column was originally published in City Journal.

On Monday afternoon, a 17-year-old girl was shot near her Brooklyn public school. She is just one of the many Black kids victimized since 2017’s Raise the Age legislation prevented violent youth in New York from being held responsible for hurting people, leading to 204% increase in teen shooting victims.

Last year, 78 more teens were shot than had been five years prior. Even worse, by 2021, the number of murdered Black kids in NYC nearly quadrupled, with 42 victims that year, or 80%, being Black (including Black Hispanic). That’s 25 more Black youths killed than in 2017.

Violent victimization in New York City is perennially a Black problem, and this disparity has only increased since the state’s recent criminal justice reforms unleashed the most persistently violent on the most persistently vulnerable. The very tiny slice of the community responsible for this violence doesn’t have to worry much, if at all, about: being detained (thanks to the 2020 bail reform); getting prosecuted (the 2020 discovery reform); having parole revoked, even for criminal violations (the 2021 Less Is More Act); or, for youthful offenders, facing judges who will send them to criminal court’s adolescent sections or who will even be aware that they have been arrested before (the 2017 Raise the Age legislation).

MAN RUSHES AT BUFFALO MASS SHOOTER PAYTON GENDRON DURING SENTENCING HEARING

It takes a willful effort to ignore the growing racial disparity in victimization. In 2017, 55.7% of the city’s 292 murder victims were Black (163 individuals)—already a disturbing number in a city that is only about one-fifth Black. By 2021, more than two-thirds of the 488 murder victims were black (327 people). By comparison, 28 white New Yorkers were killed in 2017; in 2021 that number was essentially unchanged at 29.

Unfortunately, willful ignorance is the order of the day in Albany. The ranking Black officials who championed these legislative changes in the name of Black New Yorkers are now trying to hide the mounting evidence that the Black community is suffering most under their reforms.

Last week, Albany County district attorney David Soares was scheduled to deliver testimony at a New York State Senate hearing on criminal justice data. At the last minute, the Senate counsel called the District Attorneys Association of the State of New York (DAASNY) at about 10 p.m. the night before the hearing to disinvite Soares. The concern was that Soares, a Black man, would highlight data showing that the recent criminal-justice reforms are causing ""Black victimization"" and disproportionately harming ""my community,"" as he had recently noted. Instead, DAASNY president Anthony Jordan read Soares’s statements at the hearing. Getting the bad news from Jordan, who is white, made it easier for officials to dismiss it—a feat that might have been trickier if the person delivering it was a progressive Black Democrat.

""These reforms have had their most devastating impact on Black and Brown Communities,"" read Soares’s testimony. ""If you take an honest look at the data—the increases in crime, the victims of those crimes, and the location of the most violent crimes, the connection is quite clear.""

Senator Jamaal Bailey, the Black official presiding over the hearing, fumed: ""Quite frankly some of the testimony as written is rather offensive, it’s a pejorative, and it’s condescending. . . . This testimony is replete with, quite frankly, condescending information if I may be completely honest and frank. I’m curious about how testimony like this even gets before us in a public hearing.""

Even worse, by 2021, the number of murdered Black kids in NYC nearly quadrupled, with 42 victims that year, or 80%, being Black (including Black Hispanic). That’s 25 more Black youths killed than in 2017.

Senator Zellnor Myrie, also Black, used all his allotted minutes to offer a reprimand: ""I don’t think this testimony is appropriate. I think this is a political document. I think there are a number of non-factual, political, exaggerated phrases in here, and I don’t think it is a good faith attempt by DAASNY to work with the Legislature to come to the right solution.""

These officials refused even to entertain the possibility that the reforms are harmful, instead redoubling their commitment to a weakened criminal-justice system. Bailey enthused about the passage of Raise the Age: ""The signing of this bill marks another step in the right direction to meaningfully change the lives of young people and families across the state. . . . The criminalization of young—disproportionately Black and brown—children perpetuates racial disparities in the justice system.""

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

Since the implementation of Raise the Age, Albany County, where Soares is district attorney, has seen about 312 Raise the Age cases, involving only 230 defendants: ""34% of those defendants have been arrested more than once. 19% of those re-arrested were detained as minors. Of those re-arrested, 62% were re-arrested for a violent felony,"" read Soares’s testimony. And the vast majority of these crimes took place in Albany’s Black neighborhoods.

In what way are these reforms helping Black communities, as Myrie and Bailey assert? Are Black people only Black when charged with crimes?

This is the biggest threat to Black America. Hint: it’s not the police,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

Following the release of graphic body cam footage that showed the brutal beating of 29-year-old Tyre Nichols by five Memphis, TN, police officers, the left proceeded to do what it does best: capitalize on Black suffering. Professional race-baiters like former ESPN talking head Jemele Hill rushed to blame White supremacy — a charge that many found not only tired but ludicrous considering all five officers charged in the slaying of Nichols — Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, Emmitt Martin III, Desmond Mills Jr., and Justin Smith — were Black.

Despite this reality, Hill wasn’t alone in her lunacy. CNN’s Van Jones echoed her sentiment, as did Democrat Reps. Maxwell Frost, of Florida, and Mondaire Jones, of New York, and Black Lives Matter activist Bree Newsome, who made headlines in 2015 when she scaled a flagpole outside the South Carolina State Capitol to remove a Confederate Flag.

Newsome even went so far as to say that it didn’t matter if the officers were black because ""racism is what policing is.""

AL SHARPTON CLAIMS IF TYRE NICHOLS HAD BEEN WHITE, POLICE 'WOULDN’T HAVE BEAT HIM LIKE THAT'

For decades, the left has tried desperately to brand racism as the single biggest threat to the safety, prosperity, and progression of the Black community. And this hasn’t been done by mistake; it has been done by intent. It’s been done to divert attention away from reality — a reality visible to anyone not blinded by ignorance but instead driven by truth — the reality that the most serious threat to Black America is neither racism nor White supremacy.

The truth is that the most serious threat to Black America is Progressive America.

And as we step into Black History Month, this is a threat, upon reflection, that I realize is no way new but instead one that has been a constant throughout the course of American history.

It was the left that founded the Ku Klux Klan. It was the left that fought to preserve the institution of slavery. It was the left that sought to relegate my Black great-grandparents to the back of the bus.

And it was the left that founded Planned Parenthood — an institution responsible for the extermination of millions of Black unborn babies.

And while the left denigrates leaders like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for banning so-called Black History, this is the Black history that the left doesn’t want young Black men like me to know.

And the racism of the left hasn’t changed, instead, it’s only gotten worse.

While those on the left are quick to blame so-called White supremacy for the events that took place in Memphis, what they are less eager to point out is that Memphis is a Democrat stronghold: with a Democrat mayor, a Democrat City Council, and a Democrat-led police department.

What they’re even less eager to discuss is the state of Black Americans unfortunate enough to live in a city under Democratic rule. Just look at Chicago, where 80% of homicide victims are black. Or Baltimore, where 77% of high school students can only read at elementary levels.

It was the left that founded the Ku Klux Klan. It was the left that fought to preserve the institution of slavery.

13 Senate Democrats voted against Black female judge nominated by Trump,"President Biden pledged this week to nominate a Black woman to the Supreme Court to replace retiring Justice Stephen Breyer in an offering to the progressive left.

While Biden's pledge to nominate a Black woman has received support from Democrats who see it as a win for diversity, over a dozen Senate Democrats previously tried to block a Black woman from the federal judiciary when she was nominated by former President Trump.

BIDEN SAYS HE’LL NOMINATE A BLACK WOMAN TO SUPREME COURT BY END OF FEBRUARY

The Senate Democrats in question all voted against Ada E. Brown, former President Trump’s nominee for district judge of the northern district of Texas.

Brown, a Black woman, was confirmed in September 2019 by a vote of 80-13, with the 13 ""nay"" votes coming from Democratic Senators Chuck Schumer, Tammy Baldwin, Richard Blumenthal, Sherrod Brown, Maria Cantwell, Catherine Cortez Masto, Kirsten Gillibrand, Mazie Hirono, Ed Markey, Patty Murray, Brian Schatz, Debbie Stabenow and Ron Wyden.

Only two of the offices for the 13 senators who voted against Brown’s confirmation responded to Fox News Digitals’ requests for comment.

A spokesperson for Schumer pointed to the senator’s Wednesday remarks to reporters in New York, where he said he expected the president to ""follow through"" on his pledge to nominate a Black woman and said the Senate would ""move quickly"" on his nominee.

A spokesperson for Cantwell pointed to a tweet by the senator regarding Breyer’s retirement and the ""opportunity"" to diversify the Supreme Court.

""I thank Justice Stephen Breyer for his years of service on the Supreme Court. His opinions in support of the Affordable Care Act and abortion rights have helped Americans access the health care they need,"" Cantwell tweeted. ""This is an opportunity to add diversity to our highest court and I look forward to considering President Biden’s nominee.""

The president announced on Thursday that he would be making his Supreme Court nomination based on the nominee's race and gender.

""I've made no decision except one: The person I will nominate will be someone with extraordinary qualifications, character, experience and integrity. And that person will be the first Black woman ever nominated to the United States Supreme Court,"" Biden said. ""It's long overdue, in my view.""

The announcement has seen bipartisan pushback, with former Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii tweeting Friday about ""Biden’s mistake.""

""People of all backgrounds and colors can now see how bad the Biden-Pelosi agenda is for America,"" she said. ""Inflation is the highest it’s been in over 40 years. Gas prices have hit record highs. Many young people wonder if they’ll ever be able to afford to buy a house.""

""The American people are smart and they can think for themselves,"" she added. ""They don’t need to be told how to vote based on age, race or gender. Americans of all races are coming to recognize that we were better off 18 months ago than we are today.""

""I support giving people a hand up, not a hand out,"" Green insisted. ""Instead of judging our welfare programs based on how many people they help, we should judge them by how many people they get back on their feet and make self-sufficient."" Her campaign platform calls for fiscal responsibility, free-market reforms, and limits on government regulations.

Green also condemned Democrats' position on abortion as ""extreme"" and ""out of touch,"" stating that science supports a pro-life position. She also mentioned the disproportionate impact abortion has on the Black community.

""The American people do not support abortion on demand up to the moment of birth at taxpayer expense,"" she added. ""Abortion most negatively impacts the African-American community, and I will continue to speak out against it.""

Green previously had condemned as ""insulting"" and ""shameful"" the claim that Black Americans can't or won't get IDs to vote. She said Black voters ""are not a monolith"" and insisted that Republicans can make inroads with them.

Green, a 2005 graduate of the U.S. Air Force Academy, served as a mission commander for counterintelligence in Baghdad during Operation Iraqi Freedom. After her deployment, she served as deputy chief for a nuclear command post. She retired from the military after twelve years, but currently serves in the Indiana Air National Guard.

She serves her community as an educator and founded MissionAero Pipeline, a non-profit reaching at-risk youth seeking to transform lives, inspire STEM careers, and set students on a path of learning in the aerospace industry.

Al Sharpton says Ron DeSantis trying to 'erase Black history' amid AP course controversy,"Civil Rights leader Rev. Al Sharpton traveled to Tallahassee, Florida on Wednesday afternoon to protest what he called Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ attempts to ""bring the state back to the pre-Civil Rights era by banning Black history from the classroom"" after the administration rejected a version of the College Board's high school Advanced Placement (AP) African American Studies course.

Sharpton and a group of students, parents, civil-rights leaders and elected officials gathered at the Bethel Missionary Baptist Church on Wednesday at 11:30 a.m. and marched to the Old Florida State Capitol to protest DeSantis' recent action to require revisions to the high school AP African American Studies course.

Sharpton was joined by the president of the Tallahassee chapter of the National Action Network Rev. RB Holmes to protest DeSantis' actions.

""Governor DeSantis is trying to turn February into Erase Black History Month,"" Sharpton said in a statement. ""Banning these courses is in Chapter One of the playbook for disenfranchising Black Americans. We'll be in Tallahassee next week to take a stand against the governor's actions and those willing to buckle to his pressure, because our stories and struggles must be told.""

Tensions hit new heights last month between the DeSantis administration and the College Board after the state objected to several topics that were proposed for inclusion in an AP African American studies course that was being developed.

In a statement on Saturday, the College Board expressed their regret at not pushing back against the DeSantis administration.

TAMPA RESIDENTS SPEAK OUT AGAINST SCHOOL DISTRICT'S SEX ED CURRICULUM, CALLS FOR IT TO BE REMOVED

""We deeply regret not immediately denouncing the Florida Department of Education’s slander, magnified by the DeSantis administration’s subsequent comments, that African American Studies ‘lacks educational value.’ Our failure to raise our voice betrayed Black scholars everywhere and those who have long toiled to build this remarkable field,"" the statement said.

The Florida Department of Education sent a letter to the College Board citing topics that were initially planned for the course, including ""Black queer studies"" and the ""reparations movement,"" and essentially said that the state would not offer the course unless changes were made.

""In the state of Florida, our education standards not only don’t prevent, but they require teaching black history, all of the important things, that’s part of our core curriculum,"" DeSantis said. ""This course on Black history. What are one of, what’s one of the lessons about? Queer theory? Now who would say that an important part of Black history is queer theory? That is somebody pushing an agenda on our kids, and so when you look to see they have stuff about intersectionality, abolishing prisons, that’s a political agenda.""

DESANTIS LACKS ‘CHARISMA’ TO BE PRESIDENT, LIBERAL MEDIA INSISTS: ‘THEY LIKE HIM BECAUSE THEY DON’T KNOW HIM'

The Republican Governor's comments came after White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre called the move by Florida to not permit the courses on Black history ""incomprehensible.""

""It is incomprehensible to see that this is what this ban — or this block, to be more specific — that DeSantis has put forward,"" Jean-Pierre said in a press conference. ""If you think about the study of Black Americans, that is what he wants to block and, again, these types of actions aren’t new, especially from what we’re seeing from Florida, sadly.""

""And let's not forget: They didn't ban ... they didn't block AP European history,"" Jean-Pierre added. ""They didn't block music history. They didn't block our art history. But the state chooses to block a course that is meant for high-achieving high school students to learn about their history of arts and culture.""

Manny Diaz Jr., Florida’s education commissioner, in a statement last week pushed back on the White House's comments stating that Florida will ""not accept woke indoctrination masquerading as education.""

""Despite the lies from the Biden White House, Florida rejected an AP course filled with Critical Race Theory and other obvious violations of Florida law,"" Diaz stated. ""We proudly require the teaching of African American history. We do not accept woke indoctrination masquerading as education.""

Sen. Shevrin Jones, the first openly gay and Black Florida state senator, also joined the discussion, slamming DeSantis' stance.

""Imagine this, the Gov. is willing to sink the entire ship, denying students of educational access, all for what? ‘Wokeness,’ which is really anti-Blackness, racism, and the epitome of TRUE indoctrination,"" Jones wrote in a Twitter post.

Florida Representative Maxwell Frost, the first Generation Z candidate elected to Congress, also spoke out against DeSantis' decision to reject the Collega Board's AP course on Black history.

""Ron DeSantis wants to pretend that Black history isn't American History. Leaders like him are the reason why Florida has seen a huge surge in hate crimes and acts of racism over the last two years,"" Frost tweeted.

Biden calls Black adviser 'boy' during FEMA briefing,"President Biden called a Black adviser ""boy"" during a Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA) briefing on Monday.

The president used the term while introducing his senior adviser Cedric Richmond, a former Louisiana congressman.

""I'm here with my senior adviser and boy who knows Louisiana very, very well and New Orleans, Cedric Richmond,"" Biden said at a press briefing with FEMA after Hurricane Ida rocked Louisiana.

BIDEN ACCUSED OF MAKING RACIST COMMENT WITH ‘YOU AIN’T BLACK’ RETORT

""Boy"" is considered to be a racially derogatory term toward Black men.

The president was criticized for his use of the term during his 2020 presidential campaign, when he recalled how segregationist Democrat Sen. James O. Eastland called him ""son"" but never ""boy.""

Biden was also accused of making a racist remark during his presidential campaign when he infamously claimed that if a Black person did not vote Democrat, then they ""ain’t black.""

The president’s latest slip came as he was engaged in a press conference with FEMA after Hurricane Ida made landfall in Louisiana.

GOP national spokesperson Paris Dennard blasted Biden for the slip, pointing out that Richmond is ""a 47 year old man.""

""While JaRon Smith was 38 years old when he was in a similar role for President Trump I can assure he was not called a ‘boy’ by President Trump,"" Dennard wrote on Twitter. ""Joe Biden just continues to insult Black men openly and in public because he doesn't care.""

The White House didn't immediately return a request for comment.

Biden repeats questionable claim he frequented Black church during civil rights movement,"In his remarks celebrating the birthday of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., President Joe Biden repeated the questionable claim that he frequented a Black church during the civil rights movement.

Biden gave a speech at King’s historic Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta Sunday on what would have been the slain civil rights icon’s 94th birthday. The president opened his remarks by repeating a claim – connecting himself to the civil rights movement – that has been disputed repeatedly in the past.

""Let's lay one thing to rest. I may be a practicing Catholic, but [I] used to go to 7:30 Mass every morning in high school and then in college before I went to the Black church,"" Biden said. ""Not a joke, Andy knows this.""

""Andy, it's so great to see you, man,"" the president continued, addressing former U.N. ambassador and former Southern Christian Leadership Conference executive director Andrew Young. ""You’re one of the greatest we've ever had. Andy and I took on apartheid in South Africa and a whole lot else. They didn’t want to see him coming. But we used to – that's when we would organize to march and to desegregate the city.""

BIDEN SAYS HOUSE BURNED ‘WITH MY WIFE IN IT,’ ADDING TO LONG LIST OF EMBELLISHED STORIES

During his 2020 presidential campaign, Biden frequently mentioned how he would help organize anti-segregation protests at Union Baptist Church, a prominent Black church led by the late Rev. Otis Herring in Wilmington, Delaware.

""When I was a teenager in Delaware, for real, I got involved in the civil rights movement,"" Biden said at Bethlehem Baptist Church in South Carolina in January 2020. ""I’d go to 8 o’clock Mass, then I’d go to Rev. Herring’s church where we’d meet in order to organize and figure where we were going to go, whether we were going to desegregate the Rialto movie theater or what we were going to do.""

While Richard ""Mouse"" Smith, the former president of the Delaware NAACP, defended Biden in a 2019 op-ed, claiming, ""We know Joe as the ally who was there beside us to protest the Rialto Theater’s discriminatory policy to segregate moviegoers based on race,"" his claim about attending Herring's church was disputed.

BIDEN REPEATS DEBUNKED AMTRAK STORY FOR FIFTH TIME DURING PRESIDENCY

Longtime congregants told the Washington Free Beacon at the time that they didn't recall Biden attending the church. The revelation came about the same time Biden was forced to admit his repeated claims about being arrested with Young in apartheid-era South Africa were untrue.

""I was never arrested, and I don't think [Biden] was either,"" Young said at the time.

""I guess I wasn’t arrested, I was stopped,"" Biden said.

Biden also acknowledged in the 1980s that he was not a civil rights activist and never marched during the movement.

""During the '60s, I was, in fact, very concerned about the civil rights movement,"" Biden, who was running for president at the time, said during a speech in 1987. ""I was not an activist. I worked at an all-Black swimming pool in the east side of Wilmington, Delaware. I was involved in what they were thinking, in what they were feeling.""

""But I was not out marching, I was not down in Selma,"" he continued. ""I was not anywhere else.""

Biden’s speech Sunday at Ebenezer comes as he is embroiled in controversy over the alleged mishandling of Obama-era classified documents.

Attorney General Merrick Garland on Thursday announced the appointment of a special counsel to investigate how the president handled classified documents after leaving the vice presidency in 2017. The White House on Saturday revealed that five additional classified records were found at Biden’s home in Wilmington.

Biden was invited to Ebenezer by Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, the senior pastor.

The White House did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Biden suggests people were able to quarantine because 'some Black woman was able to stack the grocery shelf' in viral clip,"Joe Biden has landed in hot water over a viral clip of him suggesting why people were able to quarantine during the coronavirus pandemic.

""They're saying, 'Jeez, the reason I was able to stay sequestered in my home is because some Black woman was able to stack the grocery shelf,'"" Biden is heard saying in the clip.

The 10-second clip, which was originally shared on Sept. 29, was just a snippet of comments the Democratic nominee made during a Sept. 15 roundtable with veterans in Tampa, Fla.

In the expanded remarks, Biden had expressed a positive tone in dealing with the problems the country faces, particularly the ones that stem from the coronavirus outbreak. He said that he's ""more optimistic ... than I’ve ever been in my whole career.""

BIDEN ACCUSED OF MAKING RACIST COMMENT WITH 'YOU AIN'T BLACK' RETORT

""And they say, 'Well, why in the hell would you say that Biden? You just talked about all these difficulties.' Well, I’ll tell you why. Because the American public, the blinders have been taken off,"" Biden told the roundtable attendees. ""They’ve all of a sudden seen a hell of a lot clearer. They’re saying, 'Jeeze, the reason I was able to stay sequestered in my home is because some Black woman was able to stack the grocery shelf. Or a young Hispanic is out there, these dreamers are out there, 60,000 of them acting as first responders and nurses and docs.' Or all of a sudden people are realizing, 'My Lord, these people have done so much. Not just Black, White, across the board, have done so much for me. We can do this. We can get things done.' And I think they’re ready.""

Biden's remarks didn't go viral until Monday after they were amplified by Turning Point USA senior contributor Rob Smith.

The former vice president was slammed on social media with critics calling the comments ""racist"" and joking about the Biden campaign calling a ""lid.""

""What???? And Black folks STILL giving him a pass!"" National Diversity Coalition for Trump CEO Dr. Darrell Scott exclaimed.

BIDEN RAISES EYEBROWS WITH REMARK CONTRASTING AFRICAN AMERICAN, LATINO DIVERSITY

""You ain’t Black if you ain’t stocking a grocery shelf for Joe Biden,"" political commentator Dave Rubin quipped, alluding to Biden's infamous ""You ain't Black"" gaffe from earlier this year.

""This should spark a lot of conversation about the morality of the lockdowns and how we’ve made lower-income Americans into human shields,"" Ricochet editor Bethany Mandel tweeted.

Many suggested that there would be an enormous uproar if President Trump or a Republican were caught saying what Biden said.

""Imagine the media's reaction if Trump said this,"" RealClearPolitics co-founder and president Tom Bevan said.

BIDEN AGAIN PRAISES LATINO DIVERSITY AS BEING 'UNLIKE THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY'

""Close your eyes. Picture Trump saying this. Now picture the media reaction. Enjoy your evening!"" The Hill media reporter Joe Concha exclaimed.

The Biden campaign did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.

The account of the pro-Trump Twitter user who originally shared the video clip appeared to have been suspended sometime Monday evening after his tweet went viral. Fox News reached out to Twitter with an inquiry as to what led to the account's suspension.

In May, Biden had to walk back comments he made to ""Breakfast Club"" host, Charlamagne Tha God, when he said ""you ain't Black"" to Black voters who were still undecided between supporting him or President Trump in the election.

In August, the former VP was similarly in damage control mode when he appeared to disparage the diversity of the Black community, saying ""unlike the African American community, with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community with incredibly different attitudes about different things.”",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-suggests-people-were-able-to-quarantine-because-some-black-woman-was-able-to-stack-the-grocery-shelf-in-viral-clip,N/A
"Biden says 'you ain't black' if torn between him and Trump, in dustup with Charlamagne tha God","Joe Biden faced a swift backlash on Friday for suggesting during a contentious radio interview with host Charlamagne tha God that those having a hard time ""figuring out"" whether to support him or President Trump ""ain't black.""

The dustup occurred 17 minutes into the former vice president's interview on “The Breakfast Club” – a nationally broadcast morning talk show popular with black listeners – when a Biden aide tried to end the interview, prompting the host to charge, “You can’t do that to black media.”

FOX NEWS POLL: BIDEN MORE TRUSTED ON CORONAVIRUS

The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee stressed that his wife had an upcoming engagement, and suggested he would have to go whether dealing with “white media” or “black media.”

“Uh, oh ... I’m in trouble,” he joked as he referred to making his wife late. Biden and his wife Jill Biden share the same studio in the basement of their home in Wilmington, Del.

After Charlamagne tha God, who is black, then asked Biden to come back on the program again and the former vice president agreed, the host added, “It’s a long way to November. We’ve got more questions.”

That’s when Biden dove into a rapid-fire defense of his record with the black community.

“I tell you if you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t black,” he said.

It's unclear whether Biden meant to refer only to the host or to the black community as a whole.

POOL REPORTER BOOTED FROM BIDEN FUNDRAISING CALL

Charlamagne tha God responded that ""it has nothing to do with Trump. It has to do with the fact that I want something for my community.”

Biden fired back, “Take a look at my record. I extended the Voting Rights Act for 25 years. I have a record that is second to none. The NAACP’s endorsed me every time I’ve run. Take a look at the record.”

After the friction, the interview – which was pre-taped on Thursday – ended on a mutually positive note with Biden again agreeing that he “will come back.""

But the ""You ain't black"" moment reverberated on social media, with the host retweeting a variety of listeners complaining about it. Biden ""should never say to a black man 'You aint black' under ANY circumstances,"" one wrote.

""The Breakfast Club"" put the question to listeners on whether they agree with Biden:

President Trump's campaign, meanwhile, quickly highlighted the clip, tweeting, “This is disgusting.”

Trump senior adviser Katrina Pierson called the remarks ""racist and dehumanizing,"" saying Biden believes black voters are ""incapable of being independent or free thinking.""

She added: ""He truly believes that he, a 77-year-old white man, should dictate how Black people should behave. Biden has a history of racial condescension and today he once again proved what a growing number of Black Americans and I have always known: Joe Biden does not deserve our votes.""

Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh spotlighted a quote from Kanye West, a prominent African-American supporter of the president, saying, “I will not be told who I’m gonna vote on because of my color.”

But Biden campaign adviser Symone Sanders defended the comments, stressing Biden's record with the black community and saying: ""The comments made at the end of the Breakfast Club interview were in jest, but let’s be clear about what the VP was saying: he was making the distinction that he would put his record with the African American community up against Trump’s any day. Period.""

Pierson, in a Trump campaign conference call with reporters, fired back that Biden's comment ""wasn’t in jest. He was serious.""

And Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina -- the only black GOP senator and a supporter of the president -- said ""I won’t even dignify that with a response"" when asked about Sanders' comment that Biden was joking.

Pierson, when asked by Fox News if Trump had ever been a guest on ""The Breakfast Club"" or if there were now plans to have the president do an interview on the program, said ""the president has not been on The Breakfast Club, I'm not sure that he's been invited.” She added that ""I'm not opposed to it you know, I think it's a place that we should go.""

Biden has enjoyed widespread support among black voters, not just in general election polls – Fox News polling shows black voters favor Biden over Trump by 76-12 percent – but during the primary battle. His victory in the South Carolina primary, boosted by black voters' support, helped revive his then-struggling campaign and catapult him toward a dominating performance on Super Tuesday.

Meanwhile, this is not the first time a 2020 contender has questioned the party affiliation of a particular race or religion. Last year, President Trump faced a backlash for saying American Jews who support Democrats show “either a total lack of knowledge or great disloyalty.”

He was pointing to anyone supporting Reps. Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, both critics of Israel.

Black GOP congressional candidate slams Black Caucus for backing her White male Dem opponent: ‘It’s sad’,"The Congressional Black Caucus has thrown its financial support behind a white male Democratic congressman in Indiana rather than to his challenger who is looking to become the only Black female Republican in Congress.

""It’s the American people versus the DC politicians and lobbyists,"" Air Force veteran Jennifer-Ruth Green told Fox News Digital in a statement. ""I’m with the American people. The Congressional Black Caucus is with the politicians and lobbyists, and their career politician ally Frank Mrvan. America’s poorest communities are proof Frank Mrvan and the CBC care more about power and helping themselves than helping the people of northwest Indiana. It’s sad.""

Campaign finance records show that the CBC donated $5,000 to the campaign of Democratic Congressman Frank Mrvan in late September as he runs to defend his seat representing Indiana’s First Congressional District. The caucus donated to Mrvan instead of his challenger Green, who would become the sole Black Republican woman in Congress if elected.

Green added that all American people regardless of party, race, or gender are ""suffering under the failed policies of Washington politicians.""

""Congressman Mrvan understands the importance of a woman's right to choose and protecting access to healthcare for all people. One of his first votes in Congress was for the American Rescue Plan which helped end this pandemic, put workers back on the job, and shored up the kinds of small businesses that are the backbone of Black community.""

""We support him because we know he will continue to fight against racial and economic injustice and ensure Northwest Indiana is able to continue to grow and thrive.""

According to its website, the main focus of the Congressional Black Caucus is a commitment to ""using the full Constitutional power, statutory authority, and financial resources of the federal government to ensure that African Americans and other marginalized communities in the United States have the opportunity to achieve the American Dream.""

Don't.' – and he did what he wanted to do…This is the exact same situation all over again, all because there was a man who wanted some sort of gratification,"" Green told Fox News Digital after the information was published by Politico reporter Adam Wren.

Black Lives Matter has nearly $42 million in assets: IRS documents,"The Black Lives Matter organization is valued in the tens of millions of dollars, according to its latest tax filing with the Internal Revenue Service.

According to 63-pages of tax documents acquired by the Associated Press, executives of the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation Inc. have nearly $42 million in assets, despite spending more than $37 million from July 2020 to June 2021.

The $37 million was spent on grants, real estate, consultants and other expenses.

BLM received $90 million in donations amid the 2020 protests and riots that were carried out in major cities across the U.S. following the death of George Floyd. The foundation reports it invested $32 million in stocks from the $90 million in donations, according to the tax documents.

Organizers tell the Associated Press that the investment is expected to become an endowment to ensure the foundation’s work continues in the future.

The foundation has an operating budget of $4 million, a board member told the Associated Press, but the tax filing showed the BLM Foundation spent nearly $6 million on a mansion in Los Angeles, according to the report.

The BLM Foundation has operated as a nonprofit sponsored by a charity before it became an independent, 501(c)(3) nonprofit in December 2020, requiring it to publicly disclose its finances.

""This 990 reveals that (the BLM foundation) is the largest Black abolitionist nonprofit organization that has ever existed in the nation’s history. What we’re doing has never been done before,"" said Shalomyah Bowers, the foundation’s board secretary.

Brian Mittendorf, Ph.D., an accounting professor at Ohio State University, said the disclosure will likely set up the foundation for criticism as its ""huge windfall"" has a ""mismatch"" and ""gaps"" in its data.

""It comes across as an early startup nonprofit, without substantial governance structure in place, that got a huge windfall,"" Mittendorf told the outlet.

""People are going to be quick to assume that mismatch reflects intent. Whether there’s anything improper here, that is another question,"" the professor continued. ""But whether they set themselves up for being criticized, I think that certainly is the case because they didn’t plug a bunch of those gaps.""

Last month, Black Lives Matter was forced to defend its purchase of a multimillion-dollar mansion using donor funds after it sparked criticism on social media.

The foundation said it was ""embracing this moment as an opportunity for accountability, healing, truth-telling, and transparency"" and it was ""working intentionally to rebuild trust"" after it purchased the Creator’s House in California, which cost nearly $6 million.

""We apologize for the distress this has caused to our supporters and those who work in service of Black liberation daily,"" the organization said, responding to the purchase and subsequent backlash.

The BLM Foundation started in 2013 after the death of Trayvon Martin, 17, and grew following the death of Michael Brown, 18, the following year.

Black Lives Matter at School Week of Action kicks off for thousands of U.S. schools,"Originally started by Seattle teachers in 2016, Black Lives Matter at School Week of Action (BLMSWA) is a week-long focus on the ""13 Guiding Principles of the Black Lives Matter movement."" Such principles include ""fostering a queer-affirming network"" by freeing an individual from the ""tight grip of heteronormative thinking"" and ""disrupting the Western-prescribed nuclear family structure.""

BLMSWA is endorsed by several educator organizations including the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), American School Counselor Association, and the National Education Association.

CALIFORNIA SCHOOL DISTRICT HIT WITH CIVIL RIGHTS COMPLAINT OVER SEGREGATION IN TEACHER SUPPORT PROGRAM

California:

In 2022, the Aurora School in California incorporated ""Julian is a Mermaid – Drag Queen Story Hour"" into its lesson planning for grade schoolers.

District of Columbia

The D.C. Area Educators for Social Justice is a ""network of educators who seek to strengthen and deepen social justice teaching."" One of their pages includes the PK-2 lesson titled ""Introduction of Transgender and Nonbinary Identities with ‘I am Jazz.'"" According to the website, the purpose of the lesson is for students as young as four to ""be able to define the words ‘transgender’ and ‘nonbinary’ and give examples of ways to support people of all gender identities.""

The teacher is instructed to pose a series of questions to the students about how to ""know if someone is a boy or a girl."" One of the questions states ""How do doctors and parents guess if we’re a boy or girl?"" The teacher is then prompted to respond to student answers by stating that ""doctors use our bodies to guess what our gender is"" but scientists are ""finding out that only having two choices, boy or girl, doesn’t really make a lot of sense.""

MINNESOTA HEALTH MENTOR REPORTEDLY OFFERS STUDENT CHEST BINDER FOR GENDER TRANSITION BEHIND PARENTS' BACKS

The day-two lesson plan for middle school, titled ""Diversity and Globalism,"" states that the ""concept of privilege is difficult to understand and particularly difficult for those who have privilege to acknowledge."" It continues by suggesting that the teacher ""do personal research and reflection"" so that the teacher has ""identified the impact of privilege"" on their life.

As part of the lesson, students are directed to complete the ""Privilege or Oppressed? Worksheet"" by ""identifying the places where they enjoy privilege and places where their status causes them to lack privilege."" The plan directs the teacher by pointing out that ""in order to understand globalism, students must comprehend privilege and understand that there are structural inequities."" Continuing: ""point out that people who benefit from privilege are unaware of the existence of the benefits they receive through their status.""

The staff-created lesson plan adds that ""teachers should be prepared that this is not a place for controversy about sexual orientation,"" and that teachers ""should not allow for space where sexuality is debated.""

Black Lives Matter's $6M California house draws scrutiny,"A $6 million southern California house used by Black Lives Matter leadership has been shrouded in secrecy, with a new report putting the organization in damage control mode.

According to New York Magazine, the 6,500-square-foot building known among BLM leaders as ""Campus"" was purchased with cash in October 2020, using funds donated to Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation.

OUTRAGE MOUNTS AFTER SCHOOLS ACROSS NATION CELEBRATE BLM'S ‘WEEK OF ACTION’

""Our angle — needs to be to deflate ownership of the property,"" an internal BLM memo said, according to the report, after the New York Magazine reporter asked them about the house. That suggestion was one of several responses floated, with others including, ""Can we kill the story?""

The same memo reportedly included bullet points about Campus, such as how it is used by the ""cultural arm"" of BLM, and could be used as an ""influencer house"" where artists can create content, and as a ""safehouse."" The memo also reportedly acknowledged ""[h]oles"" in what it called the ""security story,"" as the house would be used for publicly available YouTube videos.

Two days after the reporter reached out to BLMGNF, board member Shalomyah Bowers emailed a statement claiming that BLMGNF purchased the property ""with the intention for it to serve as housing and studio space for recipients of the Black Joy Creators Fellowship,"" a program that was reportedly announced the next day as providing ""recording resources and dedicated space for Black creatives to launch content online and in real life focused on abolition, healing justice, urban agriculture and food justice, pop culture, activism, and politics.""

""It’s a waste of resources,"" Tory Russell, an activist based in Ferguson, Missouri, told New York Magazine. Russell has reportedly been trying to raise money for a community center in Ferguson, and had been trying to get BLMGNF to contribute.

BLMGNF had just received $66.5 million before the purchase of the house, raised after the death of George Floyd. Two weeks after the group got the money, Dyane Pascall bought the property. Pascall, the report says, manages finances for an LLC run by Patrisse Cullors, who at the time was BLMGNF’s executive director.

Pascall then reportedly transferred ownership of the house to another LLC set up by law firm Perkins Coie. It was after the property officially changed hands that Black Lives Matter started using it.

Two months after the purchase, BLMGNF was granted tax-exempt status by the IRS, but while that means they must now reveal donor and expenditure information, they reportedly failed to submit the necessary forms in 2020 or 2021.

Bowers claimed in her statement that the organization ""always planned"" to list the house in disclosures to be filed this year. She stated that the building is not used as anyone’s home, and was bought through LLCs as a matter of liability protection.

Fox News reached out to BLMGNF for comment on the New York Magazine report, but they did not immediately respond.

The California house is not the only expensive Black Lives Matter property. BLM Canada announced in 2021 that they were buying a mansion to be used as a Black community center in Toronto. Reports later showed that public records listed the purchase included $6.3 million paid to a nonprofit set up by people including Janaya Khan, who is married to Cullors.

Two BLM Toronto leaders quit the organization, citing the handling of the group’s finances in their resignation letter.

""We have written this because our many attempts to bring up concerns were met with denial, gaslighting, and a refusal to acknowledge requests for accountability,"" they said. ""We were told that concerns about financial transparency and community accountability were rumours, ‘not a big deal,’ and whispers from so-called ‘counter-organizers.’""

According to New York Magazine, Campus has barely been used to produce content, despite that being one of its stated purposes. One video that was produced there had nothing to do with BLM, but was a video of Cullors baking a peach cobbler as part of a planned series for her personal YouTube channel. It is now listed as private.

Another video, from May 2021, featured Cullors and BLM leaders Alicia Garza and Melina Abdullah sitting on the patio commemorating the first anniversary of Floyd’s death. In it, Cullors reportedly lamented how right-wing media had targeted her and the organization, specifically pointing to a New York Post article about how she spent approximately $3 million for four homes.

"Black voters sue NYC over noncitizen voting, claim it violates civil rights law","A group of Black New Yorkers sued the Big Apple's Board of Elections, claiming that the new law allowing noncitizens to cast ballots in local elections violates federal civil rights law because the New York City Council passed the law in order to strengthen the voting power of certain racial groups, diluting the votes of other groups.

""They explicitly used race as a factor of demarking the voter groups that they wanted to give this privilege to and that is a direct violation of the 15th Amendment,"" former Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell, a member of the board of directors at the Public Interest Legal Foundation (PILF), which filed the lawsuit, told Fox News.

RNC SUES NYC MAYOR ADAMS OVER LAW ALLOWING NONCITIZENS TO VOTE

The 15th Amendment states that ""the right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.""

""Discriminatory intent may be established by proof that race was a motivating factor by proponents of the law,"" the lawsuit states. ""Overwhelming direct and circumstantial evidence exists that the Foreign Citizen Voting Bill was enacted with an impermissible racial intent.""

The lawsuit cites Council Member Ydanis Rodriguez, a sponsor of the bill Intro 1867-A, who said – in Spanish – that the bill would increase the power of Hispanics and Asians.

The lawsuit also claimed that Council Member Antonio Reynoso also framed the legislation along racial lines. ""When white power or white men’s power is being attacked, what they consider being attacked, they stand up and they fight,"" he said while advocating for the bill. ""They fight to preserve their power and their influence…. have to stop and think about this sea of mostly white men that have stood up against this bill at this moment in an effort to preserve their power and influence, and that is exactly what will happen every time you challenge power.""

The lawsuit also cites then-Council President Lauri Cumbo, who noted that the bill ""is going to shift the power dynamics in New York City in a major way, and we do not have the numbers or the information to know how that is going to impact African-American communities who have been the most vulnerable in their existence in New York City. …. I’ve never heard in this one discussion about how is the African-American voter going to be impacted by this bill.""

NY STATE LAWMAKER PROPOSES REFERENDUM TO BLOCK NONCITIZENS FROM CASTING BALLOTS

The lawsuit notes that the City Council passed the bill despite such concerns.

According to the 2019 American Community Survey of the U.S. Census, 1,219,776 foreign nationals reside in Bronx, Kings, New York, and Queens Counties, and of that total, 488,030 are Hispanic and 343,018 are Asian. New York City has approximately five million active registered voters, so foreign citizen voters could make up 15% or more of the electorate in future local elections, the lawsuit notes. This is greater than the margin of victory in many municipal elections.

""It is discriminatory and unconstitutional on its face,"" Blackwell said of the law. ""I am confident that this is a case that these plaintiffs will win.""

""By their chosen language and the argument that they chose to advance this, they gave us a constitutional basis on which to challenge this law,"" the PILF board member told Fox News Digital.

As former mayor of Cincinnati, Ohio, Blackwell told Fox News that he has ""serious problems"" with ""the erosion of American citizenship"" involved in allowing noncitizens to vote. Even so, he acknowledged that municipalities have the independence to make their own laws on such matters.

""While municipalities might have the right to let aliens vote on municipal issues, they don’t have the right to dilute the electoral power of an American citizen on the basis of race,"" he concluded.

Congressional black caucus requests meeting with Biden on police after Memphis killing,"The Congressional Black Caucus requested a meeting with President Biden to discuss policing and other justice reforms Sunday amid a national outcry over the police killing of Tyre Nichols.

The CBC calls on Biden to meet with the groups sometime this week, and urges the House and Senate to ""jumpstart negotiations."" The request comes days after police in Memphis, Tennessee released footage of five officers brutally beating Nichols during a traffic stop earlier in January, leading to his death in the hospital.

""[The] CBC is requesting a meeting with the President this week to push for negotiations on much needed national reforms to our justice system--specifically, the actions and conduct of our law enforcement,"" the group wrote.



""No one in our nation should fear interacting with the police officers who serve our diverse communities, large and small. We all want to be safe,"" the group added. ""Many Black and brown people, however, and many young people in general, are justifiably afraid to interact with law enforcement officials.""

Dems celebrate largest Black Congressional Caucus ever while excluding GOP Rep.-elect Byron Donalds,"The self-proclaimed nonpartisan Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) welcomed a record number of members this week, but the group could have been even larger if it had not denied membership to Republican Rep.-elect Byron Donalds.

At the start of the 118th Congress, Democrats celebrated reaching 58 members in the CBC, and a record number of Black members elected to Congress. While the group claims to be bipartisan, it excluded Donalds and has not had a Republican member since 2019.

Donalds said he planned to join the CBC since hitting the campaign trail in 2020 but his several attempts to gain a membership went unheeded.

""While the CBC has predominately been made up of members of the Democratic Party, the founding members of the caucus envisioned a non-partisan organization. Consequently, the CBC has a long history of bipartisan collaboration and members who are both Democrat and Republican,"" the CBC website reads.

HOUSE SPEAKER RACE: BYRON DONALDS RESPONDS AFTER CORI BUSH SAYS HIS ‘BEING BLACK’ MAKES HIM A PROP

Donalds was denied a membership to the CBC after requesting to join in 2021, and other Black members of Congress have not expressed interest in joining the group. The CBC did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

JOY REID DISMISSES BYRON DONALDS NOMINATION AS ‘TROLL’ MOVE THAT HE WAS WILLING TO ‘GO ALONG WITH’

Despite being nominated to become the first Black Republican speaker of the House of Representatives and a prominent GOP voice for Black Americans, Donalds has faced criticism for being a Republican of color.

Democratic Rep. Cori Bush, D-Mo., celebrated the CBC's swearing-in ceremony Tuesday, which came ahead of the full house being sworn in to Congress.

""Black excellence in Congress will continue to be an even greater force, driving the push for equity and justice for Black communities everywhere,"" Bush wrote on Twitter.

While Bush claims to support ""Black excellence in Congress,"" the Democrat fired shots at Donalds, calling him a perpetrator of White supremacy after he was nominated for speaker by members of the House Freedom Caucus.

""FWIW, @ByronDonalds is not a historic candidate for Speaker. He is a prop. Despite being Black, he supports a policy agenda intent on upholding and perpetuating white supremacy,"" Bush tweeted on Wednesday.

Donalds quickly hit back at Bush, saying: ""Nobody asked.""

""@CoriBush, if you see a Black man rise, let the man rise even if you disagree with them. I’d be happy to sit down and debate our policies one on one whenever you’d like. As a Black man to a Black woman, I’d never do that to you. It’s a shame you did it to me,"" Donalds tweeted Thursday.

CBC Chair Rep. Steven Horsford, D-Nev., recently highlighted his bipartisanship in Congress during an interview with The Washington Journal and described the CBC as ""the conscious of Congress.""

""We celebrated our 51st year, and we were the founders of 1971 by 13 founders come the original members of the Congressional Black members of the House of Representatives, and we have been known as the conscious of Congress,"" Horsford said.

Dems propose 'baby bonds' to close the racial wealth gap: 'Black lives and Black wealth matter',"House and Senate Democrats this week proposed a bill that would instruct the federal government to give anyone born in the U.S. after 2005 a $1,000 ""seed savings account,"" and then make contributions to that account until they are 18 — a plan that sponsors say is aimed at closing America’s ""racial wealth gap.""

If enacted into law, the bill would transfer billions of dollars in wealth from high-income families to low-income families, as it would fund the program by significantly increasing estate tax revenues.

The ""baby bonds"" bill, from Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., would give children up to $2,000 a year in the lowest income families, an amount that would drop as families earn more. If a family were to make more than 500% of the federal poverty level, their kids would only receive the initial $1,000 payment.

They estimate that children in the poorest families would have $46,000 to use for school or buying a home by the time they turn 18, and Booker said in a statement that the plan is explicitly aimed at fixing ""wealth inequality.""

INTERNET SHREDS BIDEN'S IRS PLAN TO TARGET WORKERS' TIPS: ‘FINALLY, WE'RE GONNA TAKE DOWN THE RICH WAITRESSES'

Pressley was more explicit and said the change would help ""Black and brown folks.""

""The racial wealth gap in America is the result of generations of precise and intentional policy violence, so we must be as intentional and as precise about advancing policies that address it head on,"" she said in a statement introducing the bill.

""Baby Bonds are one of the most effective tools we have for closing the racial wealth gap and breaking the cycles of poverty and trauma that have prevented Black and brown folks from thriving in this country, so it is no surprise that this idea has gained traction in states across the country.""

""Black lives and Black wealth matter, which is why Congress must pass our bill without delay,"" she added.

Data released by Pressley’s office this week said Black households in her congressional district have a median net worth of $8, while White households have a median net worth of nearly $250,000.

""These disparities were created by generations of government policy, contributing to the national racial wealth gap,"" her office said.

Pressley’s office estimates that less-affluent Black and ""Latinx"" families would get larger ""baby bond"" contributions than White families. It said that by age 18, the median Black child would have $29,800, the median Latinx child would have $22,300 and the median White child would have $11,690.

Democrats say the bill would be fully paid for by raising estate and inheritance taxes. Specifically, Booker and Pressley said the bill would return estate tax levels to those seen in 2009.

In that year, no taxes were paid on the value of estates up to $3.5 million and amounts above that level were taxed as much as 45%.

By comparison, in 2022, the first $12 million on an estate was free from taxation and amounts above that exemption faced a tax of 40%.

Karine Jean-Pierre says DeSantis wants to 'block' study of 'Black Americans' after rejecting AP course,"White House Press Secretary Karine Jean Pierre said that Florida Governor Ron DeSantis wants to ""block"" the study of Black Americans after his administration rejected the College Board’s Advanced Placement African American Studies course.

Jean Pierre made the comments during a White House Press briefing on Friday, calling the move by the DeSantis administration ""incomprehensible.""

""If you think about the study of Black Americans, that is what he wants to block,"" Jean Pierre said. ""These types of actions aren't new. They are not new from what we're seeing, especially from Florida. Sadly, Florida currently bans teachers from talking about who they are and who they love.""

""They didn't block AP European history. They didn't block our music history. They didn't block our art history. But the state chooses to block a course that is meant for high achieving high school students to learn about their history of arts and culture. It is incomprehensible,"" she added.

Bryan Griffin, DeSantis' press secretary, said in a statement that the Florida Department of Education rejected the course because it ""lacks educational value and historical accuracy.""

""As submitted, the course is a vehicle for a political agenda and leaves large, ambiguous gaps that can be filled with additional ideological material, which we will not allow. As Governor DeSantis has stated, our classrooms will be a place for education, not indoctrination,"" the spokesperson said.

Griffin told Fox News Digital that Jean Pierre's comments are ""demonstrably incorrect.""

""The study of African American history is not only permitted in Florida under Governor Ron DeSantis but required by law. In fact, the teaching of African American History has been expanded in Florida since Governor Ron DeSantis took office.,"" Griffin said.

Griffin pointed to a Florida statute which requires the teaching of African American history K-12 education throughout the state. He also provided a list of concerns that the state's department of education found within the course, which includes the ""Reparations Movement,"" ""Movements for Black Lives,"" and ""Black Queer Studies.""

In a letter to the College Board, the Florida Department of Education's Office of Articulation states that the course is ""inexplicably contrary to Florida law and significantly lacks educational value.

The former news anchor turned GOP firebrand was seen sitting during the controversial playing of the Black national anthem ahead of the game, which took place Sunday at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.

A photo of her refusing to stand for the anthem was posted on social media and quickly sparked a frenzy of people praising her decision.

""I’m just here for THE National Anthem,"" Lake responded to one Twitter post about the photo.

The Black national anthem, called ""Lift Every Voice and Sing,"" was played prior to the National Anthem ahead of the game, and sparked heated debate across social media.

According to the NAACP website, the song was written by NAACP leader James Weldon Johnson in 1900 as a poem that turned into a hymn.

It was played during the 2020 Super Bowl, and the league's 2020 season included the song during its Week 1 games. It was also reported prior to the league's 2021 season that the song would be played before all games.

Critics have protested its inclusion, pushing back on its elevation to the level of the National Anthem and ripping it as ""segregation"" and ""racist.""

Poll shows 0% of Black voters had 'poor' voting experience in November despite Biden claim of 'Jim Crow 2.0',"A new poll shows 0% of Georgia’s Black voters had a ""poor"" experience casting a ballot in the midterm elections in November, the first since new voting laws took hold in the Peach State.

The results of the University of Georgia poll and high turnout proved voters saw ""through the lies"" despite claims from Democrats and the White House that said the new law represents ""Jim Crow 2.0,"" Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger told Fox News Digital.

""Partisan critics of Georgia’s elections described our processes and security measures as ‘Jim Crow 2.0’ designed to ‘suppress’ voters and ‘subvert’ elections,"" Raffensperger said in a statement this week.

""But record-breaking midterm voter turnout, minimal voter wait times and an overwhelming majority of voters approving of how our election went prove that Georgia voters see through those lies. They know that Georgia elections are safe, secure and accessible to every legal voter.""

STACEY ABRAMS' GROUP ORDERED TO PAY NEARLY A QUARTER-MILLION DOLLARS IN LEGAL COSTS

The poll showed 0% of Black respondents felt their voting experience was ""poor"" during the last election. Just over 72% of Black voters polled said the experience was ""excellent"" and 23.6% said the experience was ""good.""

Additionally, almost 99% of voters said they had no issues casting a ballot and 95.3% of voters said they waited less than 30 minutes.

According to the poll, which was answered by 1,253 Georgia residents who say they voted, 84.1% of Black voters said they strongly or somewhat agreed with the statement that it is ""easy to cast a ballot in the state of Georgia"" compared to 15.9% who disagreed or didn’t know.

REPORTER CALLS OUT BIDEN FOR COMPLAINING OF 'POISON' POLITICS WHILE SMEARING REPUBLICANS AS 'SEGREGATIONISTS'

Georgia voter turnout has continued to shatter records despite the 2021 legislation that Democrats, including Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams and President Biden, insisted would make it harder for Black residents to vote.

In a March 2021 statement , Biden referred to the Georgia legislation as an ""attack on the right to vote"" containing provisions that ""effectively deny the right to vote to countless voters.""

WHITE HOUSE PRESSED ON BIDEN COMPARING GEORGIA VOTING LAW TO 'JIM CROW' DESPITE RECORD TURNOUT

Georgia officials have insisted the law makes elections more secure with various voting safeguards, while also citing record turnout as evidence voter suppression isn't happening.

Republicans make huge gains among Black and Latino voters as Dems fear 'paradigm-shift': poll,"Republicans have made huge gains among Black and Latino voters since the 2018 and 2020 elections, according to new polling from the Wall Street Journal.

GOP candidates found just 8% support from Black voters in the 2018 midterm elections, and former President Donald Trump got the same 8% level of support in 2020. Among Latinos, Democrats enjoyed a 31% lead in support over Republicans in 2018 and a 28% lead in 2020. Today, however, 17% of Black voters say they support Republicans, and Democrats lead among Latinos has shrunk to just 5 points, according to WSJ.

""I think that this could be a paradigm-shift election, where Republicans are not only making inroads with the Latino vote, but they’re now making inroads with the African-American vote,"" John Anzalone, who served as President Biden's top pollster in 2020, told the outlet.

The newfound support among U.S. minority groups is one reason Republicans are expected to take the House of Representatives on Election Day, if not the Senate as well.

LATINO VOTERS FAVOR GOP OVER DEMOCRATS, TRUMP OVER BIDEN IN KEY MIDTERM STATE: POLL

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., is confident Republicans will take back the House after four years of Democratic control on Tuesday. Polls agree with his assessment, though the size of Republicans' likely majority remains cause for debate.

""The one thing you always have to remember is majorities are not given — they’re earned,"" McCarthy told Fox News Digital last week. ""We never take anything for granted, but I feel good because of the quality of the candidates we have running from Rhode Island to New Hampshire to Connecticut to Oregon to Washington to Arizona to California.""

"San Fran's reparations committee proposes $5 million to each Black longtime resident, total debt forgiveness","San Francisco’s reparations committee has proposed paying each Black longtime resident $5 million and granting total debt forgiveness due to the decades of ""systematic repression"" faced by the local Black community.

The San Francisco African American Reparations Advisory Committee, which advises the city on developing a plan for reparations for Black residents, released its draft report last month to address reparations – not for slavery, since California was not technically a slave state, but ""to address the public policies explicitly created to subjugate Black people in San Francisco by upholding and expanding the intent and legacy of chattel slavery.""

""While neither San Francisco, nor California, formally adopted the institution of chattel slavery, the tenets of segregation, white supremacy and systematic repression and exclusion of Black people were codified through legal and extralegal actions, social codes, and judicial enforcement,"" the draft states.

The draft plan includes a long list of financial recommendations for Black San Francisco residents, including a one-time, lump sum payment of $5 million to each eligible individual.

$10M IN ARP FUNDS WENT TO PROVIDENCE ‘REPARATIONS’ COMMISSION PUSHING FOR BAIL FUND, K-12 RACISM CURRICULUM

""A lump sum payment would compensate the affected population for the decades of harms that they have experienced, and will redress the economic and opportunity losses that Black San Franciscans have endured, collectively, as the result of both intentional decisions and unintended harms perpetuated by City policy,"" the draft states.

To be eligible for the program, the applicant must be 18 years old and have identified as Black or African American on public documents for at least 10 years. They must also prove at least two of eight additional criteria, choosing from a list that includes, ""Born in San Francisco between 1940 and 1996 and has proof of residency in San Francisco for at least 13 years,"" and/or, ""Personally, or the direct descendant of someone, incarcerated by the failed War on Drugs.""

The plan also calls on the city to supplement lower-income recipients’ income to reflect the Area Median Income (AMI), about $97,000, annually for at least 250 years.

""Racial disparities across all metrics have led to a significant racial wealth gap in the City of San Francisco,"" it argues. ""By elevating income to match AMI, Black people can better afford housing and achieve a better quality of life.""

DEMOCRATS SEEK REPARATIONS, ‘NATIONAL APOLOGY' FOR SLAVERY: ‘WE ARE MOVING CLOSER’

The plan also seeks to establish ""a comprehensive debt forgiveness program"" that clears each eligible person’s student and housing loans, credit card debt, etc.

""Black households are more likely to hold costlier, riskier debt, and are more likely to have outstanding student loan debt,"" the draft explains. ""When this is combined with lower household incomes, it can create an inescapable cycle of debt. Eliminating this debt gives Black households an opportunity to build wealth.""

The committee submitted the draft proposal to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors on Dec. 23.

""The African American Reparations Advisory Committee has not yet received any feedback from the Board regarding their position on the recommendations or when the Board will schedule a hearing to formally discuss the Plan,"" the committee told Fox News Digital.

Board of Supervisors President Aaron Peskin told the San Francisco Chronicle he hopes the plan is approved.



""There are so many efforts that result in incredible reports that just end up gathering dust on a shelf,"" Peskin said. ""We cannot let this be one of them.""

"Tyre Nichols beating by 5 Black cops reveals America's 'biased police culture,' Crump, ex-Ferguson chief say","Both George Floyd’s family attorney and the former police chief of Ferguson, Missouri, argued Sunday that the fatal caught on camera beating of Tyre Nichols allegedly at the hands of five Black Memphis, Tennessee, police officers demonstrate America’s racially biased and ""institutionalized police culture.""

Ben Crump, the civil rights attorney who notably secured the record $25 million civil settlement for the Floyd family from the city of Minneapolis while the trial for ex-officer Derek Chauvin was ongoing, appeared on ABC’s ""The Week"" Sunday as he’s newly representing the Nichols’ family.

Reacting to the recently released video footage, host Martha Raddatz noted how police reforms are already in place in Memphis requiring officers to intervene or de-escalate if another officer is using excessive force. Nichols and the five since-fired Memphis officers now charged with second-degree murder, aggravated assault and other offenses, are all Black.

""As I've said, I believe it's part of the institutionalized police culture that makes it somehow allowed that they can use this type of excessive force and brutality against people of color,"" Crump said. ""And it doesn't matter if the officers are Black, Hispanic, or white, it's part of the culture, this biased culture that said this is allowed. And so just as much as those officers are responsible for the death of Tyre Nichols, so is the implicit, biased police culture that exists in America.""

TYRE NICHOLS: AL SHARPTON CONDEMNS VIOLENT PROTESTERS FOR ‘HELPING THE POLICE’ AFTER TIMES SQUARE ARRESTS

""It is not the race of the police officer that is the determinant factor whether they're going to engage in excessive use of force, but it is the race of the citizen. And oftentimes, it's the Black and Brown citizens that bear the brunt of the brutality,"" Crump added. ""You don't see videos of our White brothers and sisters who are unarmed having this type of excessive force levied against them.""

Crump said he has spoken to Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., and former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi about possibly reintroducing to Congress the George Floyd Justice in Police Act, which sought to eliminate qualified immunity for police officers.

Jason Armstrong, who formerly served as Ferguson's sixth chief in seven years following the 2014 police killing of Michael Brown, also appeared on ""This Week."" Now the current police chief of Apex, North Carolina, Armstrong was asked whether he believes the 2020 reforms implemented in Memphis could have prevented Nichols’ death.

""I do believe reforms and training can prevent this, but the number one deterrent to this is when police officers around the country see what's going to happen to them when they participate in behavior such as this, and so these individuals were fired. These individuals were charged appropriately for their actions,"" Armstrong said. ""Similarly, what we saw happen in Minneapolis with Derek Chauvin and his actions, and officers around the country seeing that this type of behavior is not going to be tolerated by law enforcement. It's not going to be tolerated by the communities that they serve.""

""But they have already seen what happened to a Derek Chauvin, and this happened. And they were wearing body cameras, yet they still behaved this way,"" Raddatz countered.

To that, Armstrong admitted, ""no matter what piece of equipment you give an officer, no matter if you have a body camera on them or people are watching, at the end of the day, you know, these are people.""

""Unfortunately, violence is what was natural for these individuals in this instance,"" he added. ""And that's what we have to do as a better job as law enforcement leaders is identifying these individuals that are inside our organizations and our police departments, and getting them out of the profession before something like this happens. And that's where the reforms really have to take place, and that's where the reforms can really have an impact.""

Asked about racial bias, Armstrong argued even Black officers can be biased toward Black people.

""We see that racial bias across all forms. It's not just in policing,"" he said. ""That’s just something that our society deals with, unfortunately in this country. There have been plenty of studies, there are plenty of bias tests that -- that people can take. And when you look and analyze the data from those tests, it shows that most people have a – a bias and a bias in particular towards Black and Brown individuals in this country, no matter if you’re White, Black, Hispanic, just like Mr. Crump alluded to.""

""And so, knowing that we have these biases that we all carry around with us, and when we talk about the implicit bias trainers and things, it's not -- no training is going to – to completely dissipate someone's bias that they have in them,"" Armstrong added. ""You know, what we're hoping individuals can learn is identifying their biases, so they learn better to work within them to whether they're not having a negative impact on somebody else. And we have to take that emotion that we're all dealing with right now, and we have to turn that into fuel and fuel that will lead us to see some change in this country.""",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/tyre-nichols-beating-5-black-cops-reveals-americas-biased-police-culture-crump-ex-ferguson-chief-say,N/A
"What is Blexit? Candace Owens explains plan to lead ‘black exit’ from Democratic Party, impact 2020","Conservative activist Candace Owens says she wants to “free” black voters from the decades-long grip of the Democratic Party – and is urging them to support a new movement she’s calling “Blexit.”

“Blexit is a Renaissance,” Owens told Fox News, giving the backstory behind the campaign she launched over the weekend. “Blexit is the black exit from the Democratic Party. It’s the black exit from permanent victimhood, the black exit from the false idea that we are somehow separate from the rest of America.”

The campaign made headlines recently after it was revealed Kanye West helped her design the Blexit logo. “Kanye saw my original design, and said, ‘I can do it better,’” Owens recalled. “It certainly was. He redesigned the logo with vibrant colors inspired by his trip to Uganda.”

Despite the recent attention, Owens told Fox News the concept of Blexit developed over time. As for the name, she recalled, it formed almost by accident. She was at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February 2017 and a radio interview had gone long, coinciding with President Trump’s speech at the event.

YOUNG BLACK CONSERVATIVES UNITE AROUND PRESIDENT TRUMP

“The doors had closed, so I ran into a room where panelists could watch the speakers on this small TV,” Owens said. “I looked up and Nigel Farage of the Brexit movement was there. I thought, here in America we need a ‘Blexit’.”

Owens then purchased the ""Blexit"" domain, and started garnering support.

Fast forward to today, and she’s added “Founder of the Blexit Movement” to her resume, next to communications director at Turning Point USA.

KANYE WEST DESIGNS T-SHIRTS MEANT TO CONVINCE BLACK VOTERS TO BREAK FROM DEMOCRATIC PARTY

The movement is geared toward the next election cycle, not the midterms. Owens said she is focused on the 2020 elections and plans to hold rallies in every major American city she claims has been hurt by Democratic policies including Chicago, Philadelphia and Detroit.

“There are people that want to change their lives that have been lied to by the media,” Owens said. “There should be something waiting for them when they make that decision, and, now, Blexit will be there.”

Owens came under fire last week when she tweeted her doubts that the person behind a spate of mail bombs sent to Democrats was a conservative. Cesar Sayoc has been charged in the case and is an avowed supporter of President Trump.

First image of black hole at center of Milky Way released by astronomers,"Astronomers have unveiled the first image of the supermassive black hole and the center of the Milky Way galaxy.

The colorized picture was produced by the international Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) Collaboration, using observations from a worldwide network of radio telescopes.

MARS INSIGHT LANDER RECORDS MASSIVE QUAKE

The group wrote Thursday that scientists had previously seen stars orbiting around something invisible, compact and very massive at the center of the galaxy, strongly suggesting that the object – known as Sagittarius A(asterisk) – is a black hole.

""This result provides overwhelming evidence that the object is indeed a black hole and yields valuable clues about the workings of such giants, which are thought to reside at the centre of most galaxies,"" it said.

Although the black hole itself is not visible, glowing gas that surrounds it reveals a ""telltale signature,"" with a dark central region surrounded by a bright ring-like structure.

The black hole is about 27,000 light-years away from Earth and 4 million times more massive than our Sun.

SCIENTISTS WANT TO LAUNCH DEPICTIONS OF NUDE HUMANS TO ALIENS

To capture the black hole, the team linked together eight existing radio observatories to form a single ""Earth-sized"" virtual telescope.

The collaboration observed Sagittarius A(asterisk) on multiple nights, collecting data for consecutive hours.

Previous efforts had found the black hole in the center of the galaxy too jumpy to get a good picture.

The researchers had to develop sophisticated new tools that accounted for the gas movement around Sagittarius A(asterisk).

The project cost nearly $60 million, with $28 million coming from the U.S. National Science Foundation. The team's results are being published Thursday in a special issue of The Astrophysical Journal Letters .

The breakthrough follows the collaboration's 2019 release of the first image of a black hole, called M87(asterisk), at the center of the Messier 87 galaxy.

While the black holes look similar, Sagittarius A(asterisk) is a thousand times smaller and less massive.

Astronomers are shocked when black hole 'burps' out a star,"Astronomers were stunned when a black hole burped out a star it had consumed three years ago, according to a new study analyzing the galactic event.

The study, published in the Astrophysical Journal last week, detailed how scientists saw a black hole swallow a small star located 665 million light years away from Earth. However, in June 2021, the same black hole began ejecting material that traveled at half the speed of light.

""This caught us completely by surprise – no one has ever seen anything like this before,"" said Yvette Cendes, a co-author of the study and a research associate at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian.

Cendes added, ""It’s as if this black hole has started abruptly burping out a bunch of material from the star it ate years ago.""

STUNNING IMAGES OF HUNTER'S MOON WORLDWIDE

Data at the Very Large Array in New Mexico informed the researchers that the black hole had resurfaced, but the team does not know why the outflow was delayed by three years. Cendes compared the black holes' activity to ""burping"" after eating a meal.

""This is the first time that we have witnessed such a long delay between the feeding and the outflow,"" said Edo Berger, another co-author of the study. ""The next step is to explore whether this actually happens more regularly and we have simply not been looking at TDEs late enough in their evolution.""

SMACKED ASTEROID'S DEBRIS TRAIL MORE THAN 6K MILES LONG

TDEs stands for tidal disruption events and describes the process by which a star is consumed by a black hole. The researchers, which named the black hole ""AT2018hyz,"" collected observations using different technologies, including the ALMA Observatory in Chile, MeerKAT in South Africa, the Australian Telescope Compact Array in Australia, and the Chandra X-Ray Observatory.

Black holes are believed to be created from the remanent of massive dead stars. These regions have the ability to consume anything and pull in all matter, including light.

Closest known black hole to Earth discovered after years-long hunt,"Astronomers have reportedly discovered the closest-known black hole to Earth.

BH1 was located about 1,600 light-years away in the constellation Ophiuchus, making it three times nearer to Earth than the previous record holder.

The dormant black hole is about 10 times more massive than the sun, according to astronomers using the International Gemini Observatory. The observatory is operated by the National Science Foundation's NOIRLab.

BLOOD MOON LUNAR ECLIPSE EXPECTED ON ELECTION DAY, LAST ONE FOR THREE YEARS

In a release, NOIRLab said this marked the first unambiguous detection of a dormant stellar-mass black hole in the Milky Way.

There are an estimated 100 million stellar-mass black holes in the Milky Way alone, with nearly all of them active.

Using the Gemini North telescope in Hawaii, the researchers discovered Gaia BH1 by making observations of the motion of the black hole's companion: a sun-like star that orbits the black hole at about the same distance as the Earth orbits the sun.

The few stellar-mass black holes in the galaxy have been detected using their energetic interactions with a companion star.

While material from a star becomes superheated and generates X-rays and jets spiraling toward a black hole, if the black hole is dormant it blends in with its surroundings.

RUSSIA LAUNCHES ROCKET WITH MILITARY SATELLITE, UN LOOKS TO BLOCK SPACE ARMS RACE

Astronomers are not clear on just how the star and black hole came to be in their current positions.

The release said the progenitor star that turned into the black hole would have been at least 20 times as massive as the sun and only lived a few million years.

In addition, if both stars formed simultaneously, the massive star would have turned into a supergiant.

NASA's Hubble Space Telescope records black hole contorting star into donut shape,"NASA's Hubble Space Telescope recorded a star's final moments in detail as it was eaten by a black hole.

The agency said the process twisted the star into a donut-like shape in the process.

When a star gets close enough, the gravitational grasp of the black hole violently rips it apart, belching out intense radiation in what is known as a ""tidal disruption event.""

Astronomers are using the telescope to better understand what happens, utilizing its powerful ultraviolet sensitivity to study the light from the AT2022dsb ""stellar snacking event.""

NASA’S WEBB UNCOVERS STAR FORMATION IN CLUSTER'S 'DUSTY RIBBONS'

The star is located nearly 300 million light-years away at the core of the galaxy ESO 583-G004.

Approximately 100 tidal disruption events around black holes have been detected by astronomers using various telescopes.

The agency recently reported that a high-energy space observatory spotted another such event in March 2021.

""We're excited because we can get these details about what the debris is doing. The tidal event can tell us a lot about a black hole,"" Emily Engelthaler, of the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian, said in a statement.

NASA'S JAMES WEBB TELESCOPE FINDS FIRST EXOPLANET ALMOST EXACTLY THE SAME SIZE AS EARTH

For any given galaxy with a quiescent supermassive black hole at the center, it's estimated that stellar shredding happens only a few times over every 100,000 years.

This AT2022dsb event was first caught on March 1, 2022, by the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae, a network of ground-based telescopes.

The collision was close enough to Earth and bright enough due to ultraviolet spectroscopy over a period of time that is longer than normal.

""Typically, these events are hard to observe. You get maybe a few observations at the beginning of the disruption when it's really bright. Our program is different in that it is designed to look at a few tidal events over a year to see what happens,"" Peter Maksym, of the Center for Astrophysics, explained. ""We saw this early enough that we could observe it at these very intense black hole accretion stages. We saw the accretion rate drop as it turned to a trickle over time.""

"Supermassive black hole devours a star, blasts its remains at Earth","A supermassive black hole swallowed up a star, ripping it apart, and uniquely expelled a beam of light from its center.

In a scientific research report published on Wednesday, astronomers say a previously unknown black hole was made known to observers when a star passed too close and was devoured.

Astronomers then observed a jetted stream of ""afterglow"" from the catastrophe, which experts call a Tidal Disruption Event (TDE), heading straight toward the Earth.

prev Image 2 of 2

""The event started when an ill-fated star approached the supermassive black hole (SMBH) on a nearly parabolic trajectory and was ripped apart into a stream of gaseous debris,"" read the scientific paper, published on Nov. 30. ""About half of the mass stayed bound to the black hole, underwent general-relativistic apsidal precession as the gas fell back towards the pericenter, and then produced strong shocks at the self-crossing point.""

ASTRONOMERS ARE SHOCKED WHEN BLACK HOLE 'BURPS' OUT A STAR

The scientists said the jetted beam — the AT2022cmc, or an ""infrared/optical/ultraviolet light curve"" — was initially red in color before it decayed over four days and changed to a blue hue.

The astronomers added: ""The optical and ultraviolet observations revealed a fast-fading red ‘flare’ that transitioned quickly to a slow blue ‘plateau’, enabling the study of two components generated by the tidal disruption: the relativistic jet and the thermal component from bound stellar debris accreting onto the black hole.""

prev Image 2 of 2

The blasted remains were so powerfully bright that astronomers detected the TDE from the dwarf galaxy a million light-years away.

The paper added: ""Observations of a bright counterpart at other wavelengths, including X-ray, submillimetre and radio, supports the interpretation of AT2022cmc as a jetted TDE containing a synchrotron.""

CHINESE ROCKET PLUMMETS UNCONTROLLED TO EARTH, NASA SLAMS RISK OF 'LOSS OF LIFE'

The TDE was discovered in Feb. 2022, before the scientific news journal received the paper about it in April 2022, and the research was finally accepted in October 2022.

TDEs have been observed before, like the AT 2020neh in June 2020.

Ryan J. Foley, a co-author and UC Santa Cruz astronomer, said this initial discovery would lead the way for astronomers to find other TDEs and new dwarf galaxies.

""This discovery has created widespread excitement because we can use tidal disruption events not only to find more intermediate-mass black holes in quiet dwarf galaxies but also to measure their masses,"" Foley said in a scientific paper co-published on Nov. 10.

The discovery spanned years of research as the distant galaxy was first observed in June 2020, and was confirmed with Young Supernova Experiment data. It was observed again from July 1, 2020, to July 17, 2020; then from August 5, 2020, to September 6, 2020.

""Over 24 months of YSE operations we observed only one AT 2020neh-like event, monitoring fields for approximately 6 months each. This equates to one event per year within the YSE observational volume,"" the scientific paper reads.

Kyrie Irving’s Nets return leads to Black Hebrew Israelites demonstrating outside Barclays Center,"The Brooklyn Nets reinstated Kyrie Irving prior to Sunday night’s game against the Memphis Grizzlies, which prompted Black Hebrew Israelites to put on a large demonstration outside Barclays Center.

The group is connected to the antisemitic film on Amazon that Irving posted to his social media, leading to his eight-game suspension by the Nets.

The movie, ""Hebrews to Negroes: Wake Up Black America,"" the same name of Ronald Dalton Jr.’s 2015 book, had a description that says the film ""uncovers the true identity of the Children of Israel by proving the true ethnicity of Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, the Sons of Ham, Shem and Japheth. Find out what Islam, Judaism and Christianity has covered up for centuries in regards to the true biblical identity of the so-called ‘Negro’ in this movie packed with tons of research.""

Wearing purple and gold T-shirts, Black Hebrew Israelites were heard chanting around the arena.

Boston Celtics forward Jaylen Brown also seems to be supporting the demonstration on his social media, where he tweeted ""energy"" in response to a video of the group.

Brown was vocal about Nets owner Joe Tsai’s comments regarding Irving’s suspension, where he said the controversial point guard ""still had work to do."" Brown, one of the vice presidents of the National Basketball Players Association, initially called Tsai’s remarks on Irving returning ""alarming.""

CELTICS' JAYLEN BROWN SCRUTINIZES NETS OWNER AMID KYRIE IRVING SUSPENSION, FINDS EXEC'S RESPONSE ‘ALARMING’

""[Tsai’s] response was alarming to me,"" Brown said via the New York Post. ""He didn’t say that the organization was working together to get Kyrie back on the floor. He said that [Kyrie] had more work to do. And our society has more work to do, including Joe Tsai. It’s 2022. It takes 10 minutes of time to see who these business owners, corporations, etc., who they’re associated with and who they’re doing business with, who they’re affiliated with.""

""I’m vice president of the union, and it’s part of my job to protect our players legally. And to see [co-founder and chairman of Nike] Phil Knight first come out and condemn Kyrie, and also see Joe Tsai say he has more work to do, I think it’s time for a larger conversation.""

While Irving’s suspension began with posting the link to the film, the Nets decided to suspend him after he had two opportunities with the media to apologize for his comments, which he said on Sunday was a ""human"" reaction because he felt he wasn’t antisemitic.

However, while completing the six-step checklist the Nets required of him before reinstatement, Irving understands now how hurtful his comments were and regrets not apologizing sooner.

KYRIE IRVING DISCUSSES ‘LEARNING JOURNEY’ SINCE SUSPENSION: ‘A LOT OF HURT THAT NEEDED TO BE HEALED’

""I don’t stand for anything close to hate speech or antisemitism or anything that is anti going against the human race,"" Irving said via ESPN. ""I feel like we all should have an opportunity to speak for ourselves when things are assumed about us. And I feel it was necessary for me to stand in this place and take accountability for my actions because there was a way I should have handled all of this.""

Stephen A. Smith says Black coaches shouldn't apply for Texans job,"The Houston Texans are once again looking for a head coach after three straight seasons of firing theirs following a single year in the lead role.

ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith believes African-American coaches shouldn’t fill out that job application.

Talking on his show, ""First Take,"" on Monday morning following the firing of Lovie Smith, who is the third African-American head coach to be let go in Houston since 2020, Stephen A. Smith sounded off on the Texans and CEO Cal McNair.

CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM

""African Americans need not apply,"" he said. ""This is not an organization that has been fair to African Americans as far as I’m concerned. And I have these two as an example. You could use Romeo Crennel and the kind of situation they put him in in the past. I don’t like this organization.""

Before Lovie Smith, Crennel (2020) and David Culley (2021) were terminated after one season. Crennel took over once Bill O’Brien was fired during the COVID year, going 4-8 with his group.

Then, Culley went 4-13 before he was let go, making way for Smith this season.

TEXANS PART WAYS WITH LOVIE SMITH AFTER ONE SEASON AS HEAD COACH

Houston hasn’t had the most competitive roster these last few years, especially after trading DeAndre Hopkins and Deshaun Watson, two of their most important players who were key in making the playoffs in 2018 and 2019. Both of those seasons, the Texans won the AFC South but were never able to make a run for the Vince Lombardi Trophy.

O’Brien was playing both the head coach and GM role at the time of the Hopkins trade to the Arizona Cardinals in March 2020, which received tons of backlash from fans and experts alike, some of which calling it one of the worst trades of all-time.

Then, Watson requested a trade after the 2020 season, as he didn’t like the changes that were made to the coaching staff and front office. Both sides were in a standoff until his sexual harassment allegations came to light.

Though he wasn’t officially suspended at the time, the Texans didn’t play Watson throughout the 2021 season for ""non-injury reasons/personal matter."" The Texans then traded Watson to the Cleveland Browns for their next three first-round draft choices as well as the Browns’ third-round pick in 2023 and fourth-round picks in 2022 and 2024. Watson also signed a lucrative five-year, $230 million deal right after the trade to be Cleveland’s long-term option at quarterback.

In turn, the Texans were back to rebuilding, and these head coaches have had a tough time creating results from the start.

BEARS SECURE NO. 1 PICK AFTER LATE-GAME HEROICS FROM TEXANS

One of the main reasons is quarterback play post-Watson, as Davis Mills, Kyle Allen and Tyrod Taylor all had trouble scoring points with the young corps on offense.

Development, though, takes time, which is why many are skeptical regarding the Texans’ plan. While players like Damien Pierce, Jalen Pitre, Derek Stingley Jr. and others have shown they can compete in this league, it takes time for teams to rebuild and develop under one system.

The Texans have already begun their head coaching search, reportedly requesting interviews with Philadelphia Eagles defensive coordinator Jonathan Gannon, Detroit Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson, Denver Broncos defensive coordinator Ejiro Evero, Eagles offensive coordinator Shane Steichen and San Francisco 49ers defensive coordinator DeMeco Ryans.

Ryans and Evero are both Black coaches, and the former was a Texans legend during his playing days as a linebacker. Ryans spent six seasons in Houston, reaching two Pro Bowls and being named the 2006 Defensive Rookie of the Year.

Evero was a part of the mass firing that occurred in Denver with head coach Nathaniel Hackett ousted before finishing his first season in the role.

Tony Dungy rips article examining Black athletes' injuries in football: 'Absolutely ridiculous',"Super Bowl champion coach Tony Dungy slammed an article in the Scientific American on Friday that claimed that the NFL’s violence ""disproportionately affected"" Black men.

The opinion article says Black men are overrepresented on the playing field and underrepresented in positions of power. The article claimed that through the process of ""racial stacking"" coaches allegedly racially segregate by playing position and put Black athletes at a higher risk.

The article added that fans tuning into football games are desensitized to the violence it brings.

Dungy shot down the main points of the article.

Kodak to Stop Making Black-and-White Paper,"Ending a century-old tradition, Eastman Kodak Co. (EK) will soon stop making black-and-white photographic paper, a niche product for fine-art photographers and hobbyists that is rapidly being supplanted by digital-imaging systems.

Kodak said Wednesday it will discontinue production of the paper, specially designed for black-and-white film, at the end of this year. But the world's biggest film manufacturer will continue to make black-and-white film and chemicals for processing.

""It's a shame to see it go,"" said Bill Schiffner, editor of Imaging Business magazine in Melville, N.Y. ""Digital has done a lot of good things for the industry but it's done some bad things too. It's making a lot of these processes obsolete.""

The paper is manufactured at a plant in Brazil. Kodak declined to specify how many employees would be affected by the production shutdown, which is part of a three-year overhaul to eliminate 12,000 to 15,000 jobs by 2007 and shrink the company's work force to around 50,000.

As the industry shifts rapidly from chemical-based to digital imaging, demand for black-and-white paper is declining about 25 percent annually, Kodak spokesman David Lanzillo said.

John Eoff, owner of Photo-Lab Inc., said his 91-year-old shop in Schenectady, N.Y., still sells ""a fair amount"" of black-and-white paper to photography students and enthusiasts, while professional photographers have mostly gone to digital printing systems already.

""What we assumed was going to happen is the traditional black-and-white paper processing was going to remain more an art form than a commodity,"" Eoff said. Other companies, led by Ilford Imaging (search) of Britain, still make paper and there will be demand for it, he predicted.

In April, Kodak posted a first-quarter loss of $142 million, citing a steady slide in revenues from film and other chemical-based businesses and higher-than-expected costs to cover job cuts. This month, it replaced its chief executive, Dan Carp, with Antonio Perez, who a few years ago oversaw the rapid growth of Hewlett-Packard Co.'s (HPQ) digital imaging business.

Kodak grew into an icon on the strength of its traditional film, paper and photofinishing businesses. It is now betting its future in digital terrain — from cameras, inkjet paper and online photofinishing to photo kiosks and minilabs, X-ray systems and commercial printers.

Ilford, the largest maker of black-and-white photo paper, went into bankruptcy last year, emerging this year after a management-led buyout. Germany's AgfaPhoto GmbH (search) filed for bankruptcy last month.

Kodak's exit from the business ""doesn't surprise me"" because many portrait and wedding photographers ""are switching over to digital,"" said Christopher Chute, an analyst with market research firm IDC in Framingham, Mass.

""If I'm printing digital photos on any kind of printer, whether it's inkjet or thermal transfer or dye sublimation, the kind of paper I use is color agnostic,"" he said. ""I can print black and white with great gray gradients and use the same system to print regular color. There's much more versatility with today's print solutions.""

""More photographers and consumers that shoot black-and-white are shooting digital, they're processing it on regular inkjet paper, and ... the quality is pretty good,"" Schiffner said.",https://www.foxnews.com/story/kodak-to-stop-making-black-and-white-paper,N/A
Texas County Official Sees Race in Term 'Black Hole',"What do ""black hole,"" ""angel food cake,"" and ""devil's food cake"" have in common?

They're all racist terms, says a Dallas County, Texas, official.

A county commissioners' meeting this week over traffic tickets turned into a tense discussion over race when one commissioner said the county's collections office was like a certain astronomical phenomenon.

""It sounds like Central Collections has become a black hole,"" Commissioner Kenneth Mayfield, who is white, said during the Monday meeting.

One black official demanded an apology, and Commissioner John Wiley Price, who also is black, said that type of language is unacceptable.

At the meeting, Mayfield said he intended his comments to be taken in the context of the scientific meaning, and became upset that he was being misunderstood.

In astronomy, the term black hole refers to a star that has collapsed upon itself, creating something so dense and small that it does not have any physical properties besides a gravitational force so great that even light cannot escape its pull.

Later, Price told MyFOXdfw.com that he believed it and other terms were racist.

""So if it's 'angel food cake,' it's white. If it's 'devil's food cake,' it's black. If you're the 'black sheep of the family,' then you gotta be bad, you know. 'White sheep,' you're okay. You know?"" Price said.

Price said people should watch their words when it comes to stereotypes.

""I think people should always be careful. You know, I'm okay if I'm 'bartering' with you. ... But if I try to 'Jew you down,' Oooooh. Is that racist? I thought it meant the same thing? No, maybe it doesn't.""

The world-renowned physicist Stephen Hawking might have a solution to the problem over perception of the astronomical term. He refers to the phenomenon as ""a singularity.""

Black Lives Matter leader accused of stealing $10M from organization: 'Unjust enrichment',"A lawsuit filed on behalf of 26 grassroots Black Lives Matter (BLM) chapters last week alleged that the leader of the national organization siphoned $10 million in charitable contributions to pay for his own personal expenses.

Black Lives Matter Grassroots (BLMGR), a nonprofit that serves as the umbrella group for local BLM chapters nationwide, claimed in the lawsuit filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court that Shalomyah Bowers, the leader of Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation (BLMGNF), defrauded the local chapters for ""unjust enrichment"" and used their funds as his ""personal piggy bank.""

BLMGNF, which received more than $90 million in the wake of George Floyd’s death in 2020, represents the national BLM movement.

Bowers, described as a ""rogue administrator"" and ""middle man turned usurper,"" led the foundation to be investigated by the Internal Revenue Service and ""[blazed] a path of irreparable harm to BLM in less than eighteen months,"" according to the suit. ""While BLM leaders and movement workers were on the street risking their lives, Mr. Bowers remained in his cushy offices devising a scheme of fraud and misrepresentation to break the implied-in-fact contract between donors and BLM.""

BLACK LIVES MATTER PAID NEARLY $4M TO BOARD SECRETARY, CO-FOUNDER'S BROTHER, AND FATHER OF HER CHILD

Melina Abdullah, the director of BLMGR and a co-founder of the Los Angeles chapter, said at a recent press conference that ""the assets that we built, the financial resources, the social media platforms and the name ‘Black Lives Matter’ have been taken from us and are under the control of consultants.""

BLACK LIVES MATTER PAID NEARLY $4M TO BOARD SECRETARY, CO-FOUNDER'S BROTHER, AND FATHER OF HER CHILD

BLMGNF's board of directors denied the allegations in a lengthy statement posted to their website Thursday. ""Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation (BLMGNF) is here to give light and fight for Black liberation,"" the statement said in part. ""Make no mistake, the allegations of Melina Abdullah and BLM Grassroots (BLMGR) are false. They are slanderous and devoid of reality.""

Bowers and his group went on to scold those who are suing him, accusing them of ""falling victim to the carceral logic and social violence that fuels the legal system.""

""They would rather take the same steps of our white oppressors and utilize the criminal legal system which is propped up by white supremacy (the same system they say they want to dismantle) to solve movement disputes,"" they said.

SOLE BLM-BACKED FEDERAL CANDIDATE CHARGED WITH WIRE FRAUD SCHEME INVOLVING CAMPAIGN AND PARTY FUNDS

Bowers is a close associate of BLM co-founder Patrisse Cullors, who resigned from BLMGNF in May 2021 after allegations she misused millions of dollars in donation money.

Disclosures found that the foundation paid $6 million for a Los Angeles compound in 2020. BLMGNF received backlash following the purchase, including from some of the organization's supporters.

BLM silent when confronted with data showing massive 2020 spike in Black murder victims,"The Black Lives Matter organization was silent when approached for comment on 2020’s skyrocketing number of Black murders and experts citing BLM and the defund the police movements for contributing to the deaths.

Fox News Digital reached out to the Black Lives Matter press team on April 14 inquiring if they had comment on FBI data showing there was a 32% increase in Black murders in 2020 compared to 2019, as well as a comment regarding experts such as the Manhattan Institute’s Heather Mac Donald arguing the BLM and defund the police movements contributed to the murder spike, not the coronavirus.

Fox News Digital also detailed the yearly numbers of Black murders from 2010 to 2020 within the inquiry but did not receive a response from the organization as of Tuesday morning.

MASSIVE INCREASE IN BLACK AMERICANS MURDERED WAS RESULT OF DEFUND POLICE MOVEMENT: EXPERTS

The summer of 2020 was marked by protests and riots from coast to coast in support of the BLM and defund the police movements following the death of George Floyd. FBI data show murders across the board spiked by nearly 30% in 2020 compared to the year prior, marking the largest single-year increase in killings since the agency began tracking the crimes.

For Black Americans, the murders spiked disproportionally.

At least 7,484 Black Americans were murdered in 2019, according to FBI data Fox News Digital reported on Tuesday. That number shot up to at least 9,941 murders in 2020, meaning there was an increase of 2,457 Black Americans murdered over the previous year.

Among White murders, FBI data show there were 7,043 White people murdered in 2020, meaning 2,898 more Black people were killed compared to Whites.

An average of 6,927 Black Americans were murdered each year between 2010 and 2019, meaning Black murders shot up by 43% in 2020 compared to the previous 10-year average.

Thousands of people across the country pledged their support for Black Lives Matter in 2020, including by joining protests. Support of the group also extended to corporations vowing donations to social justice initiatives, athletes wearing BLM apparel at the stadium and celebrities rushing to publicly support and donate to BLM.

THE CELEBRITIES WHO HAVE DONATED TO THE BLACK LIVES MATTER MOVEMENT

""Certainly, the protests and riots mid-2020 after the death of George Floyd followed a pattern of spiking violence that we've seen following past viral police incidents, such as the deaths of Michael Brown and Freddie Gray. This pattern has been termed the ‘Ferguson Effect’: police pull back while violent crime spikes precipitously,"" Hannah Meyers, director of the policing and public safety initiative at the Manhattan Institute, told Fox News Digital.

The Ferguson effect was coined by St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson in 2014 after police shot and killed Black man Michael Brown, sparking widespread protests. The theory gained widespread attention in 2016 after Mac Donald wrote an opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal arguing the effect is one ""where the Black Lives Matter narrative about racist, homicidal cops has produced virulent hostility in the streets.""

Murders in the 2010s first broke the 7,000 murder benchmark in 2015 after the high-profile deaths of Freddie Gray that same year and Brown in 2014, jumping by nearly a thousand in one year. Black murders had fallen four years prior to Brown's death, according to the FBI data reviewed by Fox News Digital.

'WOKE' RETAILERS WHO ASKED CONGRESS FOR HELP AMID SMASH-AND-GRABS SUPPORTED LEFT-WING POLICE REFORMS

Mac Donald wrote in 2020 that the Ferguson effect was playing out again following Floyd’s death in Minneapolis, and was unfolding with even more brutality.

2020’s ""violent-crime increase—call it Ferguson Effect 2.0 or the Minneapolis Effect— has come on with a speed and magnitude that make Ferguson 1.0 seem tranquil,"" Mac Donald wrote during the crime spike that year.

She told Fox News Digital this month that the Black Lives Matter and the defund the police movements contributed to the crime spike in 2020 and had nothing to do with the coronavirus and lockdowns.

FORMER FOOTBALL COACH FIRED FOR REMOVING BLACK LIVES MATTER POSTER ALLEGES FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS VIOLATED

Other experts have meanwhile cited the shock of the pandemic and its lockdowns for the crime spike of 2020. A University of California study, for example, estimated that more than 100,000 Californians bought guns in 2020 out of fear of the pandemic's destabilizing effects. The study argued that by aggravating ""poverty, unemployment, lack of resources, isolation, hopelessness and loss,"" the pandemic has ""worsened many of the underlying conditions contributing to violence.""

Meyers told Fox News Digital that the coronavirus likely aggravated the effects of the Ferguson effect in 2020, explaining that police forces were ""diminished"" with officers calling out sick, and young men, who are the ""most likely to be involved in gun violence,"" left with time on their hands when schools closed businesses shuttered.

The agency is conducting a use-of-force investigation surrounding the arrest at the request of Shelby County District Attorney General Steve Mulroy, TBI officials said Sunday in a statement.

Nichols, who was Black, was arrested Saturday night after officers attempted to make a traffic stop due to reckless driving, police said.

""Afterward, the suspect complained of having a shortness of breath, at which time an ambulance was called"" and Nichols was taken to a hospital in critical condition, police said.

Black reparations panel could decide who gets compensation,"California’s first-in-the-nation task force on reparations is at a crossroads, with members divided on which Black Americans should be eligible for compensation as atonement for a slave system that officially ended with the Civil War but reverberates to this day.

Some members want to limit financial and other compensation to descendants of enslaved people while others say that all Black people in the U.S., regardless of lineage, suffer from systemic racism in housing, education and employment. The task force could vote on eligibility on Tuesday after putting it off last month.

REP. FALLON INTRODUCES BILL TO SCRAP DIVERSITY VISA LOTTERY, LIMIT ASYLUM CLAIMS

Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation creating the two-year reparations task force in 2020, making California the only state to move ahead with a study and plan, with a mission to study the institution of slavery and its harms and to educate the public about its findings.

The committee is not even a year into its two-year process and there is no compensation plan of any kind on the table. But there is broad agreement among advocates of the need for multi-faceted remedies for related yet separate harms, such as slavery, Jim Crow laws, mass incarceration and redevelopment that resulted in displacement of Black communities.

Compensation could include free college, assistance buying homes and launching businesses, and grants to churches and community organizations, advocates say.

Yet, the eligibility question has dogged the group since its inaugural meeting in June, when viewers called in pleading with the nine-member group to devise targeted proposals and cash payments to make whole the descendants of people enslaved in the U.S.

Kamilah Moore, the committee’s chair, said she expects robust discussion at Tuesday’s meeting, which will include testimony from genealogists. She favors eligibility based on lineage, rather than race, saying it will have the best chance of surviving a legal challenge in a conservative U.S. Supreme Court.

A reparations plan based on race would attract ""hyper-aggressive challenges that could have very negative implications for other states looking to do something similar, or even for the federal government,"" she said.

JUDGE KETANJI BROWN JACKSON VOTE MAY HAVE 'A LITTLE BIT OF DRAMA' BEFORE CONFIRMATION: SHANNON BREAM

""Everyone’s looking to what we’re going to do,"" she said.

California Secretary of State Shirley Weber, who authored the legislation creating the task force, had argued passionately in January for prioritizing descendants for generations of forced labor, broken family ties and police terrorism. The daughter of sharecroppers forced to flee Arkansas in the dead of night, she recalled how the legacy of slavery broke her family and stunted their ability to dream of anything beyond survival.

Opening up compensation to Black immigrants or even descendants of slaves from other countries would leave U.S. descendants with mere pennies, she said.

But members at February’s meeting – nearly all of whom can trace their families back to enslaved ancestors – questioned the need to rush on a pivotal question bound to shape reparations deliberations across the country.

Task force member Lisa Holder shared a poignant story of losing her child at delivery, because the medical staff did not take seriously the concerns of a young Black woman who knew something was wrong with her baby, she said. In the U.S., Black mothers are far more likely to experience a pregnancy-related death than White women.

""No one asked me if my ancestors were enslaved in the United States or if they were enslaved in Jamaica or if they were enslaved in Barbados,"" said Holder, a civil rights attorney. ""We have to embrace this concept that Black lives matter, not just a sliver of those Black lives, because Black lives are in danger, especially today.""

LA JOURNALIST 'CANCELED' BY WOKE MOB FOR CRITICIZING BLM

Critics say that California has no obligation to pay up given that the state did not practice slavery and did not enforce Jim Crow laws that segregated Black people from White people in the southern states.

But testimony provided to the committee shows California and local governments were complicit in stripping Black people of their wages and property, preventing them from building wealth to pass down to their children. Their homes were razed for redevelopment, and they were forced to live in predominantly minority neighborhoods and couldn’t get bank loans that would allow them to purchase property.

Today, Black residents are 5% of the state’s population but over-represented in jails, prison and homeless populations. And Black homeowners continue to face discrimination in the form of home appraisals that are significantly lower than if the house were in a White neighborhood or the homeowners are White, according to testimony.

Nkechi Taifa, director of the Reparation Education Project, is among longtime advocates who are thrilled the discussion has gone mainstream. But she’s baffled by the idea of limiting reparations to people who can show lineage when ancestry is not easy to document and slave owners frequently moved people among plantations in the U.S., the Caribbean and South America.

CBP seizes more than 150 pounds of black market bologna,"It's no baloney!

U.S. Customs and Border Protection agricultural specialists seized more than 150 pounds of bologna at the El Paso, Texas entry port this week, officials announced Friday

CBP says Mexican bologna is a prohibited product due to its pork content. Pork products from overseas could introduce foreign animal diseases to the U.S. pork industry.

The agency said one of its officers stopped a Chevrolet pickup truck with a Texas license plate that had entered the port from Mexico. The officer spotted red rolls in the rear seat of the truck and asked the driver what they contained. The driver said he had frozen rolls of turkey ham.

Companies that loudly supported BLM fall silent when confronted with skyrocketing Black murders,"Corporate voices boomed across the nation in support of Black Lives Matter and various social justice initiatives following the death of George Floyd in 2020. Nearly two years later, what was left in the wake of 2020 was a drastic spike Black murders with experts pinning blame on the BLM and defund the police movements.

The summer of 2020 was marked by protests and riots from coast to coast in support of the BLM and defund the police movements following the death of George Floyd. Companies stretching from behemoth e-commerce and tech company Amazon to beauty giant Ulta posted messages reiterating ""Black lives matter,"" and companies around the country pledged millions of dollars to various social justice organizations that pushed to reimagine policing and reallocate funds from police departments.

FBI data reported by Fox News Digital last week shows murders spiked disproportionally among Black Americans in 2020 by 32% compared to the year prior. Murders across the board spiked by nearly 30% that year, marking the largest single-year increase in killings since the agency began tracking the crimes.

MASSIVE INCREASE IN BLACK AMERICANS MURDERED WAS RESULT OF DEFUND POLICE MOVEMENT: EXPERTS

At least 7,484 Black Americans were murdered in 2019, according to FBI data Fox News Digital reported last week. That number shot up to at least 9,941 murders in 2020, meaning there was an increase of 2,457 Black Americans murdered over the previous year.

For White Americans, FBI data show there were 7,043 White people murdered in 2020, meaning 2,898 more Black people were killed compared to Whites.

An average of 6,927 Black Americans were murdered each year between 2010 and 2019, meaning Black murders shot up by 43% in 2020 compared to the previous 10-year average.

AMAZON SUSPENDS BLACK LIVES MATTER FROM CHARITY PROGRAM AS CONTROVERSY SWIRLS AROUND GROUP'S FINANCES

To experts such as the Manhattan Institute’s Heather Mac Donald, BLM and the defund movements that swept the nation directly contributed to the spike. The spike ""began months after lockdowns beginning only after riots,"" Mac Donald told Fox News Digital, noting the ""spike was not at all related to COVID.""

Fox News Digital reached out to a handful of corporations and companies that pledged support for Black Lives Matter and various organizations supporting tenets of the defund movement, such as the Equal Justice Initiative and the National Urban League in the days and months following the death of Floyd.

The Equal Justice Initiative advocates for the reallocations of ""funds from traditional policing to services that promote public safety. "" While the National Urban League outlines on its website that it has "" 21 Pillars "" on ""comprehensive and realistic reform and accountability,"" including ""collaborate with communities to re-envision public safety"" and ""change divisive policing policies.""

Representatives for Nike, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Ben & Jerry’s, Nordstrom, Target and Ulta did not return Fox News Digital’s requests for comment.

Companies such as Nordstrom , Ben & Jerry’s and Amazon openly aligned themselves with Black Lives Matter.

Nordstrom said in January of 2021 that it was ""supporting the important work of nonprofit organizations,"" including the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation. Amazon announced in 2020 that it was donating $10 million ""to organizations that are working to bring about social justice and improve the lives of Black and African Americans,"" including BLM.

While Ben & Jerry’s noted in 2020 that it supported the BLM movement years before Floyd’s death and declared, ""Today, we want to be even more clear about the urgent need to take concrete steps to dismantle white supremacy in all its forms.""

'WOKE' RETAILERS WHO ASKED CONGRESS FOR HELP AMID SMASH-AND-GRABS SUPPORTED LEFT-WING POLICE REFORMS

Nike - along with Converse, Jordan Brand and Michael Jordan - announced in 2020 it would donate a combined $140 over 10 years to organizations such as the National Urban League and Equal Justice Initiative . Apple launched a $100 million program called the Racial Equity and Justice Initiative in June of 2020, which pledged support to various groups including working with EJI. Facebook pledged support to groups fighting racial inequality just days after Floyd’s death, including EJI, as did Ulta Beauty . In 2020, Target announced a $10 million commitment to "" advancing social justice ,"" including donations to the National Urban League.

The Equal Justice Initiative and National Urban League did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment when confronted with the FBI data on Black murders and experts arguing the defund movement contributed to the spike.

Black Lives Matter’s press team has not responded to repeated requests for comment on the data and experts’ arguments. The national organization, which was co-founded by a self-described ""trained Marxist,"" has come under intense scrutiny in recent months as questions were raised about leadership’s financial dealings. Amazon announced in February of this year that it suspended the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation from its charity platform for failing to disclose where tens of millions of dollars were allocated.

Just last week, former diversity leader under the Donald Trump administration Bruce LeVell wrote an op-ed slamming corporations for their ""huge miscalculation"" in backing the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation.

Arizona diversity leaders slammed for falsely accusing Black DJ of wearing blackface,"Two Arizona diversity in education advocates falsely accused a Black man who was hired as a DJ at a school fundraiser of wearing blackface.

""They thought that the DJ there or the person there was in a black face, and the person that they thought was in black face was me,"" DJ Kim Koko Hunter said in a Facebook Live video April 12.

The PTA at Hopi Elementary of the Scottsdale Unified School District hired Hunter to perform at a fundraiser to benefit the school on April 9, the Daily Mail reported. The event, ""Hopi Night Fever,"" pulled in $300,000 for ""essential programs and services.""

TOP DEI STAFF AT PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES POCKET MASSIVE SALARIES AS EXPERTS QUESTION MOTIVES OF INITIATIVES

But two diversity advocates who have volunteered for committees connected to the Scottsdale Unified School District , Stuart Rhoden and Jill Lassen, accused Hunter of wearing blackface after seeing a photo of him at the Disco-themed event, according to the Arizona Daily Independent.

Lassen, a self-described ​​""ardent community volunteer, activist, and ally to the LGBTQ+ community"" who co-chairs the Scottsdale Parent Council's diversity, equity and inclusion committee , sent an email to the PTA accusing them of promoting racism, according to the Arizona Daily Independent.

Megan Livengood, head of the Hopi PTA, responded to the message that Hunter is in fact a Black man.

""The DJ that the Hopi PTA hire[d] was, in fact a Black man,"" Livengood wrote according to correspondence obtained by the Arizona Daily Independent. ""It is insulting that you feel myself or PTA condone racist behavior or encourage it by posting on social media.""

Lassen apologized following the PTA chief’s email.

""You are right, we should’ve reached out and inquired before making such accusations. I cannot fathom the hurt, anger and frustration you felt after you and others volunteered countless hours on your event. Again I truly apologize,"" she wrote, according to the correspondence.

Hunter explained in his Facebook Live that an organizer of the event called a person he works with to inquire whether he is Black.

Rhoden, an instructor at Arizona State University who has worked with the Scottsdale school district's equity and inclusion committee , also issued an apology to Hunter after he questioned the PTA's acceptance of blackface, the Daily Mail reported. In a Facebook post reviewed by Fox News Digital, Rhoden apologized but also showed side-by-side photos of Hunter and argued that it appears he darkened his face.

MARYLAND COUNTY TO 'TRANSFORM' SOCIAL STUDIES CURRICULUM TO STRENGTHEN KIDS' 'SENSE OF RACIAL' IDENTITY

""Let me be clear, a Black man, apparently in Black face is an entirely different discussion than a White person. However I did not state that the person was White. It was assumed that was my intent, and perhaps it was, but nonetheless, looking on his FB page (photos below), it seems at the very least he is in darker make-up if not ‘Black face’ or I am completely mistaken and it's the lighting of the patio,"" he wrote on Facebook April 12.

""I apologize to dude for the implication, but the sentiment still stands, Black face by anyone, in this day and age is problematic. I also apologize to folks who reposted and made other statements based on my assumption,"" he continued.

The Scottsdale Unified School District told Fox News Digital that neither Lassen nor Rhoden are ""employees of the Scottsdale Unified School District.""

""They do not speak for the district nor represent it. As parents, they have previously volunteered to participate in district committees,"" the statement to Fox News Digital on Monday said. ""Likewise, the Scottsdale Parent Council is an organization that is separate and independent from the district and does not speak for the district.""

Hunter also addressed the accusation that he was a Black man doing blackface during his Facebook Live.

""Was I not Black enough? How black do I got to be for people to know that I’m an actual Black person,"" he said.

A petition is now circulating to remove Lassen and Rhoden from the Scottsdale Parent Council and do away with the equity, diversity and inclusion committee.

""The division being caused Is quite disturbing, in a time when unity is imperative and desperately sought after. Anything other than removal of these members will be seen as tacit complacency by anyone who is paying attention,"" the petition states .

""The SPC is so intent on finding racism they will go so far as to accuse a member of one of the communities they claim to advocate for of reprehensible behavior. SPC invoices every Scottsdale Unified School District PTO/PTA/APT for dues each year and then uses those funds to attack community members,"" said Scottsdale Unified School District parents and public school activist, Amanda Wray, according to the Arizona Daily Independent.

Ex-Memphis cops charged in Tyre Nichols' death 'swarmed' Black Army vet and beat him 3 days earlier: lawsuit,"The same, now-fired Memphis police officers, who were seen on bodycam videos beating Tyre Nichols, leading to his death, allegedly beat a Black Army veteran three days earlier, according to a recently filed $5 million lawsuit.

Monterrious Harris was with his cousin on Jan. 4 when he was ""suddenly swarmed by a large group of assailants wearing black ski-masks, dressed in black clothing, brandishing guns, other weapons, hurling expletives and making threats to end his life if he did not exit his car,"" according to the lawsuit.

The 38-page legal action, which was filed in Tennessee federal court on Feb. 7, names Emmitt Martin III, Desmond Mills, Justin Smith, Demetrius Haley and Tadarrius Bean, all of whom have been fired from the department and charged with second-degree murder in connection with Nichols' death.

The lawsuit also named the Memphis Police Department and four unknown officers, who are listed as John Does 1-4.

On Thursday, the Shelby County District Attorney's Office announced it is reviewing all cases — prior and pending — of ex-officers Martin, Mills, Smith, Haley and Bean.

TYRE NICHOLS' DEATH: FORMER MEMPHIS COP TOOK AND SHARED PHOTOS OF BLOODIED VICTIM

Memphis police couldn't immediately be reached Thursday evening.

The lawsuit alleges more than a decade of police brutality, particularly against Black men, and mentioned two specific cases in 2011 and 2015.

TYRE NICHOLS DEATH: MEMPHIS OFFICIALS SAY 8 ADDITIONAL POLICE OFFICERS COULD FACE DISIPLINE

In 2018, the federal court in Western District of Tennessee found the Memphis Police Department violated a 1978 consent decree that prohibited ""unconstitutional spying on and surveilling citizens,"" according to the lawsuit.

""In recent years alone, an examination of Defendant City of Memphis’ and the Memphis Police Department’s law enforcement practices paints a painful and sordid picture of its police force assaulting, abusing and trampling the constitutional rights of the very citizens it exists to protect and serve,"" the lawsuit says.

""All of these stories share a familiar and unfortunate theme, the Memphis Police Department continually and brazenly disregarding the constitutional rights of the citizens of Memphis, Tennessee through a slew of unlawful, heinous and nefarious customs and practices. This case is now among these stories.""

Harris, an Army veteran who was medically discharged, thought the officers' alleged ""unrelenting,"" one- to two-minute attack on him was a carjacking, according to the lawsuit.

FORMER MEMPHIS COP CHARGED IN TYRE NICHOLS' DEATH ALLEGEDLY BEAT UP INMATE IN 2015

""Consistent with the beating visited upon Mr. Nichols, the Scorpion Unit then exacted a swift, violent and continuous physical assault on Mr. Harris that included punching, stomping and dragging him across concrete,"" the lawsuit says.

""Fortunately, residents of the apartment complex heard the loud shouting and noise and came outside to investigate. In all likelihood, the presence of these Good Samaritan witnesses prevented further harm to Mr. Harris.""

Harris was bleeding from the head, his left eye was swollen shut, and he had ""great difficulty"" walking because his right leg was swollen and ""severely"" bruised and his left leg was gashed, according to the lawsuit.

DOJ TO REVIEW MEMPHIS POLICE DEPARTMENT'S ‘SPECIAL UNITS AND USE OF FORCE POLICIES’ AFTER TYRE NICHOLS' DEATH

He was arrested and faces several ""false"" charges, according to the lawsuit, that include a convicted felon in possession of a handgun, criminal trespass, evading arrest, intentionally evading arrest in an automobile, possession of firearm during a dangerous felony, possession of a controlled substance (and intent to manufacture, distribute/sell), tampering with fabricated evidence and possession of drug paraphernalia.

After being treated in a hospital, Harris was taken back to jail, where he stayed for nine days until his family posted bond.

Graphic content warning:

The Scorpion Unit was disbanded after Nichols died during a traffic stop on Jan. 7.

""The current ignoble chapter of the Memphis Police Department ending with the violent and unconstitutional beatings of Mr. Harris, other Memphians and the death of Mr. Nichols, began decades ago,"" the lawsuit says.

TYRE NICHOLS DEATH: MEMPHIS POLICE OFFICER WHO ALLEGEDLY USED TASER FIRED, 'DEPARTMENTALLY CHARGED'

""The Memphis Police Department unconstitutional policies, practice, and customs leading to the formation of the Scorpion Unit, which operated as a gang of vigilantes, was consistent with abuses that citizens have suffered for many years.""

Nichols was stopped by police for alleged ""reckless driving."" Officers said a ""confrontation occurred"" during the traffic stop, and Nichols attempted to flee the scene.

Officers caught up with Nichols and began to kick him, punch him or hit him with a baton. During the beating, Nichols was complaining about having shortness of breath. He was transported to the hospital in critical condition and died Jan. 10.

Mills was also accused of later giving Nichols' mother an inaccurate description of the incident.

Martin claimed Nichols attempted to grab a gun from the officer's holster after another officer forced him out of the vehicle, and that Martin helped by grabbing Nichols' wrist.

But video evidence does not corroborate Martin's allegation about an attempt to grab a gun, the documents said.

'Most hated': White student sues historically Black college for $2 million over racial discrimination,"A White student at Howard University’s law school is suing the institution for racial discrimination, alleging the school created a ""hostile education environment.""

Michael Newman, the plaintiff, attended Howard University School of Law starting in the fall semester of 2020 and remained there for just two years until he was expelled in September 2022. He is seeking $2 million in monetary damages for ""pain, suffering, emotional anguish and damage to his reputation.""

Frank Tramble, vice president and chief communications officer for Howard University, said that while he could not comment ""substantively"" due to pending litigation, the university ""is prepared to vigorously defend itself in this lawsuit as the claims provide a one-sided and self-serving narrative of the events leading to the end of the student’s enrollment at the university.""

Newman suffered ""depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts"" as a result of ""public ostracism, vilification and humiliation,"" the lawsuit claims. At one point, Global Head of Diversity Recruiting Reggie McGahee allegedly told Newman that he had become the most hated student McGahee had seen during his tenure at the university, according to the suit.

HOUSE GOP VOTES NEXT WEEK TO KILL BIDEN'S ‘WOKE’ ESG INVESTING RULE

When Newman raised concerns over his treatment to school administrators, the law school’s dean allegedly denied that Caucasian students at Howard Law, and Newman in particular, faced racial discrimination to any degree.

Following discussions of Newman’s purported racial insensitivity, students learned of a tweet from Newman’s private Twitter account that included a picture of a slave baring his badly scarred back with the caption: ""But we don’t know what he did before the picture was taken,"" according to the lawsuit.

Newman claimed the tweet was mocking commentators who ""attempt to explain away videos of police brutality by claiming the victim must have committed wrongdoing before the video started."" He alleged that students responded with references to his race, gender, sexual preference, age and personal appearance.

MOM IN LIBERAL STATE URGES PARENTS TO DITCH PUBLIC SCHOOLS FOR HOMESCHOOLING: ‘CHANGE THE LIVES’ OF YOUR KIDS

The trouble started when the university shifted to remote learning at the start of the pandemic, meaning students communicated through purely online forums and through GroupMe chats, Newman claimed in court papers.

After a symposium featuring an African-American speaker in the run-up to the 2020 election, Newman said he posted on a professor’s forum page asking if further dialogue could be had on ""whether: (1) Black voters didn’t question turning to government for solutions, and (2) reliably voting for the same party every election disincentivized both parties from responding to the needs of the black communities.""

Some students responded negatively to Newman’s post and reached out to school administrators, prompting Newman’s removal from one of his group chats for the class, according to the allegations.

Newman also described feeling ""utterly disenfranchised"" at the school and compared himself to a Black student at a primarily White university. The student response was again largely negative, with some calling his comment ""offensive,"" he claimed.

MASSACHUSETTS DEMOCRAT TOLD TO STEP DOWN AFTER ABORTION COMMENTS LEAVE PARENTS IRATE

Newman repeatedly apologized for offending anyone, stressing he was seeking to ""learn, not just law, but to learn the thoughts and experiences of people of color,"" the lawsuit stated.

But Newman allegedly faced more overt hostility, with many students starting to refer to him as ""mayo king"" (a perceived reference to his race) and ""white panther,"" and students claimed that ""controversies"" that they blamed on Newman had caused ""severe stress"" and ""distracted them from their studies.

Newman tried to remedy the situation by sending out a four-part letter to explain his views, but the effort was labeled a ""manifesto,"" with one student accusing him of ""manipulating [classmates’] emotions … as a social experiment,"" the lawsuit said. The letters allegedly resulted in Newman’s removal from a second class-wide group chat.

School of Law Dean Danielle Holley later secretly recorded a Zoom meeting she called with Newman and McGahee, during which she suggested Newman transfer to another school, accusing him of racially harassing classmates, according to the allegations.

SEATTLE HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER CHARGED WITH HAVING SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP WITH 16-YEAR-OLD STUDENT

During a digital town hall attended by 300 participants to discuss controversies surrounding Newman, Holley allegedly characterized Newman’s letters as ""disturbing in every sense of the word,"" according to the suit. She allegedly blocked him from using several functions to try and speak up in his defense, even disabling the chat function and turning off his camera.

Holley and Newman wound up filing simultaneous complaints, with Holley accusing Newman of ""continual harassment of member [sic] of the Howard Law community, and disturbance of the learning environment at the School of Law."" At the same time, Newman claimed Holley had perpetuated ""threats,"" ""discrimination"" and a ""hostile academic environment.""

In a panel reviewing Holley’s complaint, the school determined that Newman was ""responsible"" and ruled that he should be expelled. To his knowledge, Newman’s complaint was never adjudicated, the suit claimed.

Newman appealed the ruling, but a second review panel allegedly reached the same conclusion despite the revelation that Holley had supplied the first panel with evidence that Newman never saw, which he argued amounted to ""secret evidence.""

The attorneys representing Newman filed the suit in federal court.

It is also unclear what exactly the lesson consisted of.

Politis has since removed her children from the preschool.

The images initially sparked outrage after they were shared in a parents' group chat. Politis then raised her concerns with Studio Kids director Patricia Vitale.

""This is racist,"" Politis texted Vitale, according to a screenshot of the conversation.

Vitale responded, ""I’m sorry?""

Politis replied, ""A lot of moms are very concerned.""

""What is racist?"" Vitale asked, confused as to what Politis was referring to.

Vitale then sent out a message to all the parents apologizing for the incident.

""We have not intended to offend anyone, and we are very sorry about any inconvenience,"" Vitale wrote in her message, according to screenshots. ""The parents that know us, know that we have never had a bad intention in our institution.""

Another parent, who wished to remain anonymous, said she was ""shocked and somewhat destabilized"" after learning of the photographs. She was concerned that the incident may have involved her child, but eventually discovered that it was another class. She then told her child's teacher how the lesson was ""inappropriate"" and that she wanted to speak to the director.

Black woman dumps paint on more Black Lives Matter murals in NYC: 'We want our police',"A Black woman opposing the Black Lives Matter movement, who was arrested Saturday for dumping paint on a BLM street mural outside Trump Tower, livestreamed herself doing the same thing again at similar murals in Harlem and Brooklyn later that evening.

Bevelyn Beatty, 29, livestreamed each installment on her Facebook page. In her most recent post, Beatty recounted covering up parts of the murals with paint.

“Ya’ll, we did an all-nighter,” Beatty says in a Sunday Facebook post. “Let me tell you something, yesterday was epic.”

Beatty could be seen in the first livestream smearing paint outside the Midtown skyscraper, as police tried to apprehend her.

“Refund the police,” Beatty could be heard shouting. “Jesus matters! We will never support Black Lives Matter!”

One of the officers surrounding the woman slipped on the paint and fell to the ground, injuring his head and arm, police said. He was listed in stable condition at Bellevue Hospital.

She was arrested and charged with criminal mischief, but was released shortly thereafter, the New York Post reported. Within hours, she was back to work at other murals, according to the report.

NYU student group demands Black-only student housing on campus,"New York University officials signaled they are open to a student group's demands to create Black residence floors on campus next year, but the petition is already receiving backlash for proposing students segregate themselves.

""A story claiming that NYU is implementing 'racial segregation in its dorms' is false and misleading,"" a university spokesperson said in a statement. ""The University strongly supports the goals of diversity, and of creating an environment that is welcoming, supportive, and inclusive for students of color and students from marginalized communities.

""NYU is a predominantly white institution, making it very difficult for Black students to connect or find community, especially when incidents involving racism occur,"" Black Violets told Fox News. ""It is not about exclusion, but rather creating a space where Black students can feel included.""

Critics of such plans say such living arrangements would be akin to racial segregation, as in the story the NYU spokesperson referred to.

""There is nothing progressive about the establishment of racially segregated housing at NYU,"" Karsten Schneider wrote in a column for the World Socialist Web Site. ""It is irrelevant whether the segregation being implemented is voluntary or mandatory. Racial segregation, in all forms, is entirely reactionary.""

Schneider pointed out that the petition started two months ago has roughly 1,100 signatures, compared to NYU's student body of more than 26,000.

Black Violets is pushing for other reforms, including that NYU hire Black professors in its politics department and create a Black student lounge on campus. The latter goal may be moot because of the coronavirus pandemic, but Black Violets told Fox News the pandemic will not delay their push for a Black themed engagement floor.

""But they still do not make the university equitable or make the structural changes we as Black students have been asking for.”

Black cowboys played major role in shaping the American West,"PHOENIX – Calls for social justice amid the Black Lives Matter Movement has renewed focus in addressing the ignorance of the past, including the often-overlooked history of black cowboys and the significant role they played helping shape the American West.

Hollywood and history books have painted a predominately white picture of the Old West when in reality, it was a much more diverse landscape.

“Not every enslaved person took cotton, not all of them tended to ground. Some of them were actually employed as ranchers,” Tyler Parry, a University of Nevada Las Vegas associate professor, told Fox News. “The true tragedy is to ever paint the American West or the idea of the cowboy as strictly just a white man in a hat with a gun.""

He said the country is filled with accounts of black cowboys who worked cattle drives, told stories around campfires and helped establish towns in the West.

Nat “Deadwood Dick” Love was born into slavery in the 1850s and became a legendary figure known for getting into adventures on cattle drives. William “Bill” Pickett was a famous rodeo star credited with founding the sport bulldogging, also known as steer wrestling.

“To imagine what we go through dealing with racism and social injustices to imagine what he [Pickett] had to go through in the early 1900s to persevere and become a legend solidifies his history for me,” Gerald Anderson, Pickett’s great-nephew, told Fox News.

Pickett was the first African-American inducted into the National Rodeo Hall of Fame. He was credited with helping to bridge the racial divide at the end of the Civil War in 1865.

Anderson pointed to a photo that he said was remarkable, given when it was taken. There's Pickett on horseback with two white cowboys sitting in the photo, which he said was ""virtually unheard of in the 1900s.""

“That tells you about the love, respect and admiration for Bill Pickett that they’re willing to take this photo with him sitting horseback while two white cowboys were sitting on the ground. He crossed those color lines and barriers before Jessie Owens, before Jackie Robinson.”

Lanette Campbell founded the Arizona Black Rodeo in 2012. Her mission was to educate the public about black cowboys and their role in the American West.

“Arizona really needed some culture brought to life here,” Campbell said. “People are still surprised to this day that there are black cowboys. These guys will ride up and down the street and people will really stop and look and say, ‘Wow, we just didn't know we had black cowboys.’”

BLACK LIVES MATTER NETWORK ESTABLISHES $12M GRANT FUND

Shaheed Muhammad, who is training for a relay race in the upcoming Arizona Black Rodeo on Labor Day weekend, said his friends were shocked when he decided to trade the California beaches for a pair of spurs and the Arizona desert.

“I’m from LA, the ocean, so they can’t believe I came out here and turned into a cowboy,” Muhammad said.

He saw his first cowboy while growing up in Compton and said he was proud to see the Compton Cowboys take to the streets on horseback to protest for social justice in the wake of George Floyd's death in police custody in May.

“It was beautiful to see them out there,” Muhammad said.

The group helps engage the community through horseback and farming lifestyle while educating people about African-American’s western heritage.

Despite being in “cowboy country,” Muhammad said “people still don’t believe black people ride horses or own horses” and that he feels a sense of responsibility to change that.

“I think it is our responsibility to, you know, bring that information to them, that some of the first the very first cowboys were black,” he said.

Andrea Underwood, who is practicing barrel racing, said horseback riding is “in my blood” and is excited to see the African-American community continue to grow each year.

“So many people are shocked to hear about this all-Black ranch out here and they get excited when I tell them about it,” Underwood, who is black, said. “You don't see many black cowgirls out here either, so it's something exciting to share and people are always interested to hear about it.”

BLACK LIVES MATTER LEADER CALLS FOR DEFUNDING POLICE: 'BLACK PEOPLE DO NOT TRUST POLITICIANS'

Historians estimate that a quarter of cowboys were black at the time.

Eduardo Pagán, Arizona State University's Bob Stump Endowed Professor of History, noted the numerous mistakes in literature that would fantasize and romanticize the West and was “blind to a number of realities.”

Pagán told Fox News, “If you look at literature in the 19th century, African-Americans as characters are rarely featured, and if they are, they're only caricatures.”

And those popular western movies in the early 1900s built off this literature that ignored the rich diversity that defined the West, additionally overlooking the role Mexicans and American Indians played during that time.

“This literature got all sorts of things wrong,” Pagán said. “As Americans, what we come to think about the West and what we learned about the West is really shaped by media, by the Westerns that we watched – the John Wayne or Clint Eastwood.”

“I think it's just this general American stereotype that what we call blackness has to just mean urban, when in fact, historically, you can argue the opposite, that black people were very much involved in settling different areas throughout the United States and creating unique cultures, but also ones that contributed to the broader society as well,” Parry said.

Campbell is doing her part to help rewrite history, using the Arizona Black Rodeo as a platform to help educate as well as entertain. She plans to hold a rodeo on September 5 in Scottsdale, Arizona.

“For us to create our own history and to actually make sure we preserve our history is something that we have to continue to do and that's why we actually do have black rodeos,” Campbell added.",https://www.foxnews.com/us/the-history-of-black-cowboys-and-their-role-in-shaping-the-american-west,N/A
University of Florida students change minds on renaming Black Friday after learning origins,"University of Florida students who said they support changing the name ""Black Friday"" had a change of heart when informed that the shopping holiday’s name has nothing to do with race.

In a video released Wednesday by Campus Reform, students at the Gainesville campus were asked by reporter Ophelie Jacobson whether they supported renaming ""Black Friday,"" citing an opinion article that argued it discriminates against Black people.

PRO-CHOICE COLLEGE STUDENTS AVOID 'MY BODY, MY CHOICE' ARGUMENTS FOR VACCINE MANDATES

""Honestly I’m down to rename that,"" one student responded. ""I don’t like the name Black Friday. I never really have since I was small. Whenever I would go to stores, everything would be jammed packed and I would see workers, kind of, it sounds wrong, but they would lean more toward the lighter skinned people. Like, they would assist them.""

""I think that equality’s important,"" another student said.

""I mean, I think it’s definitely a valid opinion. I kind of agree it should be changed just because Black Friday sounds offensive,"" another student said.

One student countered that changing the name ""isn’t going to help actual Black people"" and that it’s not an issue that she would protest against.

The origin ""Black Friday"" is heavily debated, but the History Channel says it ultimately stems from 1960s Philadelphia, where police used the term to negatively describe the frenzied shopping that ensued on the day after Thanksgiving, just before the Army-Navy football game kicked off that Saturday every year. In the 1980s, retailers reportedly reinvented the term to mean that stores would turn a profit on the day after Thanksgiving, and go from red to black, after operating at a loss for the entire year.

""The term Black Friday has nothing to do with race,"" Jacobson, the Campus Reform reporter, informed the students in the video. ""Should we still change it?""

""No,"" one student said. ""If it’s not about skin color then I don’t see that there’s a problem.""

""If you want to just rename it to, like, spare the feelings, then that’s not helpful,"" another said.

""It’s just a word. Like, it’s a color,"" added another.

""Everything will be found offensive at one point,"" said another.

Virginia: Oldest surviving schoolhouse for Black children relocated to Colonial Williamsburg,"A historic building believed to be the oldest school used to teach Black children in the U.S. was picked up and relocated to Colonial Williamsburg on Friday.

The Bray School, constructed 25 years before the American Revolution, was loaded onto a flatbed truck and transported a half-mile from an area near the college campus of William & Mary to the living history museum.

The move comes as the historic site continues to emphasize African American history.

""Religion was at the heart of the school, and it was not a gospel of abolition,"" said Maureen Elgersman Lee, director of William & Mary’s Bray School Lab.

HOUSE DEM VOWS TO REMOVE MORE 'SHAMEFUL' HISTORICAL STATUES DURING BLACK HISTORY MONTH

The pinewood building held as many as 30 students at a time, historians have said.

""There was this need to proselytize and to bring salvation while still not doing anything to destabilize the institution of slavery,"" Lee said. ""Save the soul, but continue to enslave the body. It was the here versus the hereafter.""

On Friday, hundreds of people lined the streets to celebrate the trip to Virginia’s colonial capital as it continues to teach early history through reenactments, interpreters and restored buildings.

DEMOCRATS DEMAND REMOVAL OF LINCOLN EMANCIPATION MEMORIAL IN DC

The Bray School stands as a symbol for historians and descendants alike defiant of the belief all enslaved Americans were uneducated. The school’s faith-based curriculum — created by an English charity — however, justified slavery and encouraged students to accept their fate as God’s plan.

The curriculum was still empowering, perhaps even subversive, historians said.

""I was going through a facsimile of one of the books, and there are words like ‘liberty,’"" Lee said. ""What did learning those words do to expand these children’s sense of themselves? Their sense of the world?""

The school’s student body is believed to have included free and enslaved students.

BLACK PATRIOTISM IN US HISTORY: HERE IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE TO REMEMBER DURING BLACK HISTORY MONTH

A white teacher named Ann Wager, who lived upstairs at the school, taught an estimated 300 to 400 students, whose ages ranged from 3 to 10, according to surviving records.

The Bray School was established in 1760 at the recommendation of Benjamin Franklin, chairman of a London-based Anglican charity named after philanthropist Reverend Thomas Bray. It operated until 1774.

The charity also set up schools in other cities, including New York and Philadelphia.

The building became a private home for years before being incorporated into William & Mary’s campus.

Williamsburg is less than 10 miles from Jamestown, which England established in 1607.

The identity of the original Bray School building was confirmed in 2021, through the use of dendrochronology, a scientific method that examines tree rings in lumber to determine the wood’s harvest date.

""This is a remarkable story of survival,"" said Matthew Webster, Colonial Williamsburg’s executive director of architectural preservation and research. ""And for us, it’s so important to put it back (to its original state) and tell the full and true story.""

Buckingham Palace member resigns after repeatedly asking Black woman what country she ‘really came from’,"An honorary member of the Buckingham Palace household has resigned after repeatedly asking a Black woman who runs a charity for survivors of domestic abuse what country she ""came from,'' despite her insistence she was a British national.

The conversation was detailed on Twitter by Ngozi Fulani, chief executive of Sistah Space, an east London refuge that provides specialist support for women of African and Caribbean heritage.

The incident took place at a reception hosted by Camilla, the queen consort, for women working to fight domestic violence.

Fulani said that when she told a household member she was from east London, she was asked, ""No, what part of Africa are YOU from?""

The palace said it took the incident extremely seriously and investigated the ""unacceptable and deeply regrettable comments.’’

Britain’s Press Association and a number of other media outlets in Britain identified the woman who made the remarks as Lady Susan Hussey, who served as Queen Elizabeth II’s lady in waiting for more than 60 years. She is also a godmother to the Prince of Wales.
