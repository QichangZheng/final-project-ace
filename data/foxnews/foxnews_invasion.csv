"Vanessa Bryant wins lawsuit against Los Angeles County over invasion of privacy, awarded $16 million","A Los Angeles jury sided with Vanessa Bryant in her lawsuit against Los Angeles County over privacy claims after she alleged that pictures of the crash scene were shared among county officials, and ruled that the county must pay her $16 million.

Vanessa Bryant and Christopher Chester sued Los Angeles County and her attorneys claim that ""close-up photos"" were shared on multiple devices within the sheriff's department and fire department, and members of the public.

Bryant's invasion of privacy trial began on Aug. 10 and her attorney, Luis Li, said that the pictures taken at the helicopter crash scene by a fire captain and deputy were ""visual gossip"" viewed ""for a laugh,"" with no official purpose.

""They were shared by deputies playing video games,"" Li said. ""They were shared repeatedly with people who had absolutely no reason to receive them.""

The jury also ruled that the county must also pay Chester $15 million, whose wife and daughter died in the crash.

The county's attorney said that the pictures were an essential tool for first-responders who thought that some lives could have been saved at the crash scene.

Kobe Bryant, an NBA legend, was killed in the helicopter crash on Jan. 26, 2020, along with his daughter and seven other people.

"America's fentanyl crisis: 'It's an invasion,' says William Bennett, former drug czar","Former U.S. drug czar William Bennett said the United States is right now ""soft on too many things"" — including the criminals who are smuggling deadly fentanyl into the country and contributing to the death of numerous Americans.

Bennett on Monday followed up a ""Fox & Friends"" television appearance with an original interview by phone with Fox News Digital in which he shared his strong concerns about the fentanyl pouring into the United States via the southern border.

On this topic, Bennett took Rolling Stone magazine to task for its recent article that criticized warnings from the GOP about fentanyl hidden in candy this fall as millions of America's kids get ready to go trick-or-treating for Halloween.

WISCONSIN PARENTS LOSE SON TO FENTANYL, BEG OTHER FAMILIES TO KNOW THE TRUTH ABOUT THE DEADLY DRUG

""This crazy business of Rolling Stone — let's resolve it,"" he said. ""Let's have the writers [of that article] have a couple,"" said Bennett.

The Rolling Stone article was titled, ""No Treats, Only Tricks: Republicans Try to Ruin Halloween by Using a Fake Fentanyl Threat.""

The article went after those who have raised alarms about the prevalence of deadly fentanyl in the country — and the way it's being snuck into a variety of other products.

As for the Rolling Stone article's authors who maintain that there's no real issue with fentanyl in the U.S.: ""If they're right, there's no problem. If they're wrong — they're dead,"" Bennett said.

He went on, ""Do you want your kids to be part of that experiment? That's just crazy.""

FENTANYL DEATHS OF AMERICA'S YOUNG PEOPLE: ‘IMMINENT THREAT TO OUR SOCIETY’

""Who do you believe?"" Bennett also said of the threat posed to Americans by fentanyl all across this country. ""Rolling Stone or the DEA and the Border Patrol? I'll take the DEA and the Border Patrol, thank you.""

""Who do you believe? Rolling Stone or the DEA and the Border Patrol?""

He added of drugs intercepted at the border, ""They've tested it — they've tested it.""

Bennett said that America, in a very short time, has lost to fentanyl far more people than were killed during the entire Vietnam War over a multiyear period.

FENTANYL POISONING'S SURPRISING SIGNS: WHAT PARENTS AND FRIENDS MUST KNOW

""We lost nearly 108,000 people"" just last year to opioid poisoning, he said — with two-thirds of those deaths attributed to fentanyl-like substances.

During the entirety of the Vietnam War, more than 58,000 Americans died, he said.

""This is an invasion,"" said Bennett of the fentanyl crisis.

And now, he added, the cartels are basically saying, ""'Screw you, America. Now, we're going to take it to your kids.' At what point does a country show its backbone?"" he said.

""There's a very clear policy"" that the U.S. has at its disposal, he said.

""You can declare these cartels to be Foreign Terrorist Organizations. As we did in the Middle East or Syria, we could then go after them. And you take them out because they are Foreign Terrorist Organizations.""

""At what point does a country show its backbone?""

In terms of why he thinks the administration isn't being tougher on this issue, he said, ""That's a question for a psychiatrist. I don't know. I keep thinking about this line from Flannery O'Connor, the great writer, who said, ‘You have to push back against the age as hard as it pushes against you.’ And this age is pushing very, very hard,"" he said.

WHAT IS FENTANYL? HERE'S MORE TO KNOW ABOUT THE DANGEROUS DRUG

He said it's possible the current U.S. administration does not want to anger Mexico and that they're generally sympathetic to open borders.

""But we've done … the experiments already"" on this issue, he said. ""Look at Oregon. They legalized everything. It's madness out there.""

Importantly, Bennett also said, ""The journeys that end in fentanyl always start with marijuana. Always, always.""

""It is a gateway. And while not everyone who uses marijuana goes on to more dangerous drugs, anybody who does go on to getting fentanyl on the street started off with marijuana,"" he said.

Bennett said his jaw dropped recently when he saw two mothers on television discussing the issue of drug overdoses.

""What in the world were they doing ordering Percocet and Vicodin?""

One mother said of her son, as Bennett recounted, ""Well, he was at a party, and they all ordered Percocet and Vicodin — and they got fentanyl instead. And they were killed.""

""What in the world were they doing ordering Percocet and Vicodin?"" he added.

Prescription medication should only come from a doctor or medical professional and only for a very specific health reason, Bennett said.

""The guy on the street who's selling this — he doesn't give a damn about your pain,"" said Bennett. ""He doesn't care about the amount [of fentanyl present in any of the drugs he's selling], either. He's just trying to make it profit.""

Bennett noted that addressing pain is an important issue: ""Many people suffer from serious pain. But do it the right way,"" he said.

Bennett's comments come on the heels of a Wall Street Journal op-ed that he wrote, published Monday, which took the Biden administration to task for its soft-on-crime and soft-on-drug policies.

He wrote, ""If President Biden had really wanted to do something about the problems facing our cities and states — rising crime, addiction and overdose deaths — he might have done something to prevent illegal drug use.""

Added Bennett in his op-ed, ""Instead, he chose to minimize the dangers of drug use by granting pardons for criminals convicted of marijuana possession under federal law. In so doing, Mr. Biden has sent the country the wrong signal at the wrong time.""",https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/america-fentanyl-crisis-invasion-william-bennett-former-drug-czar,N/A

Russian troops stalled north of Kyiv, running out of gas and food: US official Russian combat forces north of Kyiv have not advanced since Monday and have been running out of food and gas, a senior U.S. defense official said Tuesday.

The official added that the ""stall"" north of Kyiv is due in part to tough Ukrainian resistance and ""fuel and sustainment problems."" The lack of advance could also be a result of Russia regrouping, rethinking or reevaluating their strategy, the official said. A ""significant number"" of Russian troops are conscripts, the official said, describing them as ""very young men drafted into service"" who may not have been fully trained or aware that they would be participating in combat operations.

"Russia-Ukraine war: United Nations approves resolution condemning Putin, Russia: LIVE UPDATES","Madmen like Putin who sanction killing of children shouldn't be appeased: Gowdy

There is a lot going on in the country, in the world. And when there's a lot going on, it's the perfect time to think and analyze and ask questions starting with ourselves. The answers, I think, will eventually come — or partial answers will eventually come — if we do spend enough time reflecting and analyzing and posing the right questions to those in positions of power and also to ourselves.

So, we'll start with what's been on my mind, which is that Russia invaded a sovereign neighboring country, and civilians are being killed. Russian and Ukrainian civilians are bearing the cost of wars waged by a Russian despot, which should lead us to wonder why there has been any equivocation by some in this country on the nature and intentions of Vladimir Putin.

Some in the media and in positions of power seem frankly enamored with Putin. Looking at the images of dead Ukrainian children should settle the question of who Putin is once and for all. It's not something I've wondered about, but it is apparently something that others have wondered about. And it does beg the question of what some people are drawn to.

Russia invades Ukraine: LIVE UPDATES,"Ukrainian member of parliament says she's ready to defend her country

Ukraine humanitarian ceasefire with Russia not holding: LIVE UPDATES,"Breaking News Russia says it will let Ukraine civilians leave 2 areas Saturday: report

Russia says its military will observe a ceasefire in two areas of Ukraine starting Saturday to allow civilians to evacuate, Russian media reported, according to The Associated Press.

At least one Ukrainian official confirmed the information, the report said.

Russia said it would allow civilians to leave the areas of Mariupol in southeast Ukraine and Volnovakha in the eastern part of the country beginning at 10 a.m. Moscow time, or 2 a.m. in the Eastern U.S.

The vaguely worded Russian statement was unclear about how long the ceasefire would last, the AP reported.

In Mariupol, an administrative official said the ceasefire there would last until 9 a.m. ET Saturday and a humanitarian corridor for transporting people and supplies would start at 4 a.m. ET, according to the report. The corridor in that area would extend from Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia, said Pavlo Kirilenko, head of the Donetsk region military-civil administration that includes Mariupol.

The Russian media report came after Oleksiy Danilov, leader of Ukraine’s security council, called for such a humanitarian move, according to the AP.

Meanwhile, the U.N. World Food Program warned that millions of Ukrainians will be needing food “immediately” as the war affects supplies in stores.

In Washington, Congress was scheduled Saturday to consider a request for $10 billion in humanitarian aid and security funding for Ukraine, according to the AP.

Abbott invokes Constitution's 'Invasion Clause' as Texas lawmakers slam Mayorkas' border 'baloney',"Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott invoked Article IV Section 4 of the U.S. Constitution – known as the ""Invasion Clause"" – and gave his state law enforcement the power to arrest migrants and drop them at ports of entry rather than deporting them, and Lone Star lawmakers are celebrating.

Republican Rep. Jodey Arrington of Lubbock called out President Biden's inaction and what he called ""baloney"" rhetoric from Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.

""I applaud [Abbott] for that because in fact, the two major contributing factors are the dereliction of the sacred duty to enforce the laws of the land by the president [and] the complete abandonment to provide for defense against an invasion or to repel it at the federal level,"" Arrington told ""The Story"" on Thursday.

BIDEN PROVES HIMSELF TOXIC TO DEMOCRATS DURING OHIO TRIP: JORDAN

While Abbott stopped short of calling the border crisis a literal ""invasion,"" according to Fox News' Bill Melugin on the ground at the border, the governor's office echoed Arrington in saying Biden is failing in his duty.

The invasion clause says the federal government ""shall guarantee every state in this Union a republican form of government and shall protect each of them against invasion…""

The small-""r"" republican term deems the U.S. a republic of representatives versus a majoritarian democracy, rather than the GOP as a party.

In recent remarks, Mayorkas claimed to have ""said repeatedly and we continue to warn people not to take the dangerous journey"" while White House press secretary Karine Jean Pierre again claimed ""the fact of the matter is the border is closed.""

""Yeah. Mayorkas is full of baloney,"" Arrington responded on ""The Story."" ""Nobody believes him in this country. Actions in Texas speak louder than words.""

""Their actions are welcoming vulnerable people to take a dangerous journey, and their actions are in reach, enriching the drug cartels and jeopardizing the safety of the American people,"" he added.

Jonathan Turley 'skeptical' Texas counties can declare border invasion,"Fox News contributor Jonathan Turley told ""America’s Newsroom"" on Tuesday he is skeptical that Texas officials calling for a border invasion declaration would hold up in court.

""I'm afraid I'm skeptical. As they say in Texas, this dog won't hunt. They're relying on the guarantee clause of Article Four, Section Four, and that deals with an invasion, which is generally interpreted and long interpreted to mean an actual foreign invasion in the form of an army, an organized force,"" said the constitutional scholar.

""I don't think a court would seriously consider expanding the term invasion to cover this.""

Multiple Texas counties on Tuesday will declare that the migrant crisis at the southern border is an ""invasion,"" Fox News has learned, a move that could lead to similar declarations across the state.

ARIZONA AG BRNOVICH ISSUES LEGAL OPINION DECLARING BORDER CRISIS ‘INVASION’ UNDER CONSTITUTION

Kinney County Judge Tully Shahan is expected to announce the move at a news conference Tuesday afternoon, along with a number of other officials from other counties who will join him.

Kinney County Attorney Brent Smith told Fox News Digital that he believes approximately 12 to15 counties could end up having declared an invasion by the end of the month.

With migrant numbers hitting historic levels, and with more than 239,000 migrant encounters in May alone, there has been considerable talk in conservative circles about the merits of declaring the crisis an ""invasion"" -- which could open up a number of potential legal avenues for states.

Former Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Russ Vought and former acting deputy DHS Secretary Ken Cuccinelli, both now at the Center for Renewing America have urged governors to make the declarations and use war powers to order Arizona’s police or National Guard to remove illegal immigrants to Mexico themselves.

Turley said that all Americans should be alarmed over the number of migrants crossing the border illegally.

""This is really breathtaking, the degree to which we're seeing an influx,"" Turley said, emphasizing that the solution is more of a political matter.

""It's a matter of competency, not the Constitution. It goes to the Biden administration's failure to take a more concerted effort to try to stem the flow. But I don't believe that a federal court would lend much credence to the expansion of the guarantee clause [of the Constitution].""

DHS SECRETARY MAYORKAS APPEARS TO PLACE BLAME ON MIGRANTS AFTER 53 PEOPLE FOUND DEAD IN A TEXAS TRUCK

Former Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Russ Vought and former acting deputy DHS Secretary Ken Cuccinelli, both now at the Center for Renewing America have urged governors to make the declarations and use war powers to order Arizona’s police or National Guard to remove illegal immigrants to Mexico themselves.

They have pointed to language in Article I of the Constitution, which allows for States to ""engage in War"" when it has been ""actually invaded, or in such imminent Danger as will not admit of delay"" without the approval of Congress. They also note Article IV says the U.S. ""shall protect each [state] against invasion.""

Del Cueto said declaring an invasion allows for greater access to resources for communities affected by mass migration. He also emphasized how drug cartels have the ability to flourish because of gaps at the southern border.

""You have to be able to deport some of these individuals. And just like I said, if the federal government isn't doing something about it at this point, somebody needs to do something. You can't just wave the white flag. That's the bottom line.""

Del Cueto said Border Patrol is overwhelmed and said Texas ""should have declared an invasion a long time ago.""

Del Cueto concluded by stating that migrants will continue to cross as they are incentivized to do so under the current system.

""We were drowning in the work that was coming to us as a result of the cartel activities in our counties,"" he continued. ""Governor Abbott threw us a lifeline, kept us from drowning, but the tide is rising, and we have to do more because even with the resources he's provided us and the cooperatives that we have developed, what we find is that the work continues to rise, and the manpower is at its ceiling.""

The pair touted Governor Greg Abbott for his efforts to counter the crisis, but warned more needs to be done as drugs and illegal immigration continues to swarm the state.

Several border counties have declared an invasion in response, in hopes they will garner the support and resources they need to counter the influx.

""It's a very dangerous situation when you're as remote as some of our landowners are and the ability to get law enforcement to take sometimes hours, so they're kind of on their own,"" Nettleton said.

""The areas out here are so vast and so wide that you can't get enough law enforcement in all the places that it needs to be able to protect the American citizens that are out there on these ranches and trying to make a living,"" he continued.

"Biden’s weakness emboldened Putin’s Ukraine invasion. One year later, we’re more at risk","NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

One year ago, Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his bloody invasion of Ukraine. While Putin clearly expected the war to be over in a matter of months, the bravery and fortitude of the Ukrainian people continue to frustrate and deny the Russian dictator even today. As we mark this auspicious anniversary and prepare for the second year of war, it is essential that we assess how this conflict began, its impact on the American people, and what it will take to end it.

Sadly, the Biden administration doesn’t seem serious about achieving a real victory and deterring America’s adversaries as it has been too slow in delivering the means necessary to deter or defeat them.

This war was far from inevitable. We cannot say for certain that it would not have happened had the Trump administration been in office, but I can say this: It didn’t happen on our watch.

UKRAINE WINNERS AND LOSERS: CHINA MAKES GAINS, BUT WHERE DO OTHER COUNTRIES STAND?

We knew it was Putin’s aim to establish Russian dominance over all the old Soviet bloc countries, including in Ukraine (as well as all of Eastern Europe). We prevented invasion by establishing deterrence: we kept the Nord Stream II pipeline from being completed, we withheld talks on a new START treaty, and we worked with our partners in NATO to increase defense spending and present a greater potential response to any act of Russian aggression.

We also supplied Ukraine with the tools it needed to deter an invasion and counter the Russian proxy forces in eastern Ukraine. We knew Putin’s objectives, and we took the steps necessary to deny him any room to achieve them.

We also were consistent – just as we deterred Putin, we imposed costs on anyone who threatened to harm or undermine our interests. Putin saw how we approached Iran, North Korea and China, and knew that threatening our interests was met with a real and costly response.

What changed? It certainly was not Putin. We should remember that the same man who ordered the invasion of Ukraine one year ago also ‘annexed’ Crimea during the Obama administration.

Then as now, Putin saw weakness in President Joe Biden’s leadership. He watched Biden’s botched withdrawal from Afghanistan that cost 13 brave Americans their lives, with no reprisal or costs imposed on those responsible. He took note when Biden said that a ""minor incursion"" into Ukraine would be permissible even as Russian forces massed on Ukraine’s border, as well as Biden’s failure to impose costs on Russia following the hacking of American pipelines.

The deterrence we created during the Trump administration was lost due to Biden’s weakness. And Biden’s failure to protect American sovereignty at our southern border sent a signal that no border is to be respected. Putin didn’t change; American leadership changed, and that opened the door to the invasion of Ukraine.

Biden’s weakness and this war have had real consequences for the American people. Energy prices were pushed higher once the invasion began after Biden had already driven them up by killing America’s energy dominance, leading to the persistent inflation that continues to crush American families. Global supply chains and food markets have also been upset by the war, which has greatly affected American businesses and farmers.

Failing to defeat the Russians in Ukraine may only lead to a growing conflict in Europe and further harm our deterrence in Asia or the Middle East. The Ukrainians are fighting this war without U.S. troops, but that would not be the case should the Russians achieve victory in Ukraine and move on to a NATO country. Biden’s failure to put the American people first economically and in preserving our security has cost us here at home and around the globe.

Sadly, Biden continues to allow the war to proceed on Putin’s terms, choosing to ""lead from behind"" rather than leading a response that will bring the war to an end. Even having passed massive defense spending packages centered around military aid to Ukraine, this administration continues to send our aid piecemeal.

That is not to say that the rest of Europe shouldn’t do more – they should. And Ukraine hasn’t asked for our men and women in uniform to fight for them, nor should we provide such assistance. They are only asking for the equipment to fight their own battle, but Biden isn’t responding nearly fast enough to force Putin to reconsider his objectives.

His recent pledge to send American Abrams tanks is a clear example: Rather than be taken from the tanks already stationed in Europe, we are going to build 30 new tanks and ship them there. This process will take months, if not an entire year.

It will do nothing to actually deter Putin – it will only assure him that our aid will not be rapid or concentrated enough to give the Ukrainian military a decisive advantage. This timidity and weakness encourages Putin that America and its NATO allies are not serious about deterring him.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER

It is essential that the Biden administration change its approach, not just to achieve a favorable outcome in Ukraine, but to establish our deterrence with adversaries beyond Russia. This weakness will only embolden the bad guys.

Vladimir Putin was watching Biden’s botched withdrawal in Afghanistan, but so was Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping. Xi is now contemplating assisting the Russians with lethal aid, a move that will only intensify the conflict and inflict further death and destruction on the Ukrainian people.

The CCP spy balloon that was allowed to traverse the entire United States for a week is evidence enough that Xi feels more emboldened than ever, and respects U.S. leadership as little as ever. Xi is now watching how we approach Ukraine with an eye towards Taiwan, and a slow, weak, and feckless response in Ukraine greatly increases the risk that Xi will feel emboldened to move against the island nation. The consequences of such a move for the American people would dwarf those of the war in Ukraine.

Biden visited Kyiv this week and proclaimed that ""Ukraine stands. Democracy stands. The Americans stand with you, and the world stands with you."" This is all well and good, but we should never forget that warm words and triumphant photo-ops are not a replacement for real deterrence and assistance.

If we do not back up our words with action, we will do little to convince our adversaries that there are costs for attacking U.S. interests. Indeed, we will only reinforce the impression of American weakness held by the likes of Putin, Xi, Iran's Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and North Korea’s Chairman Kim Jong Un.

If Biden does not correct this in the second year of the war in Ukraine, he will greatly increase the risk these individuals pose to the American people.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/bidens-weakness-emboldened-putins-ukraine-invasion-one-year-later-were-more-risk,N/A
"Tucker Carlson: Our leaders are lying about Putin's invasion of Ukraine, and it's insulting","NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

When the Russian military invaded Ukraine last month, the most highly credentialed people in the world seemed stunned by it and that was not very reassuring to the rest of us.

""It was a shock to many of the leading experts and policymakers in the United States, Europe and even Ukraine,"" explained a fellow expert and policymaker at the Atlantic Council. ""The head of German intelligence was so caught off guard that he was still in Kyiv and had to be evacuated.""

That's pretty weird if you think about it, because for weeks, Joe Biden had been speaking in a very loud voice about a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine . They seemed ready for it and yet it turns out that nobody in Washington, including Biden himself, really thought it was going to happen and when it did happen, official Washington concluded that Putin must be insane.

UKRAINE APPEARS TO HAVE BEGUN SHELLING RUSSIAN TERRITORY

""The casual speculation about Vladimir Putin's mental state has become more serious,"" wrote National Review. In other words, there's a reason, a good reason none of us saw this coming. Putin just snapped. He's irrational and impossible to predict. A lot of people took that at face value, but you had to notice that, like most explanations you hear in Washington, it was self-exculpatory. It was more an excuse than an analysis.

In fact, Putin may well be crazy, but it's fair to assume there was more to the invasion of Ukraine than a single psychiatric episode and at this point, it would be nice to know exactly what it is, what happened and why. Why did the Russians do this? It's not treasonous to ask that. It's essential. You can't make wise decisions about the future without understanding what just happened. It's a prerequisite, but our leaders so far have refused to do that. They keep lying to themselves. They're imposing censorship on the rest of us.

RUSSIA CLAIMS LITTLE ACCOMPLISHED IN PEACE TALKS WITH UKRAINE

They're forcing the entire American population to mouth childish slogans about good versus evil. It's insulting, but worse, it's not helpful. This is not how nations survive complex moments like this. Crisis demands crystal clear thinking. So now is the moment to ignore the people who've been consistently wrong and instead listen carefully to the people who've gotten it right in the past, the ones who saw the Ukraine war coming and said so out loud. Those are the people you should be listening to and one of them is Nigel Farage.

Nobody would call Farage a stooge of Vladimir Putin , just the opposite. Farage is a nationalist. He cares about his own country. He's devoted his life to it. In his case, his country is Great Britain, whose long-term interests have been gravely damaged by the Russian invasion and by the West's response to it. The same is true, unfortunately, of our country.

The U.S. has never had a president as reckless as Joe Biden is. We're going to pay the price for that for a long time. But Nigel Farage, had you asked him, could have predicted all of this. In fact, he did predict it back in 2014 as the leader of the U.K. Independence Party. Farage gave a speech to the European Parliament that year, which unfortunately, we just saw yesterday. In retrospect, his words seem prophetic. Farage understood what would happen because he saw clearly what had already taken place. Read this carefully. We think you'll agree it's an analysis worth understanding. Here's Nigel Farage eight years ago on Ukraine.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

NIGEL FARAGE: Among the long list of foreign policy failures and contradictions in the last few years, including, of course, the bombing of Libya, the desire to arm the rebels in Syria, has been the unnecessary provocation of Vladimir Putin.

This EU empire, ever seeking to expand, stated its territorial claim on the Ukraine some years ago. Just to make that worse, of course, some NATO members said they too would like the Ukraine to join NATO. We directly encouraged the uprising in the Ukraine that led to the toppling of the president, Yanukovych, and that led, of course, in turn to Vladimir Putin reacting and the moral of the story is if you poke the Russian bear with a stick, don't be surprised when he reacts.

Now, just to continue with that, today we are rushing through an association agreement at undue speed with the Ukraine and as we speak, there are NATO soldiers engaged in military exercises in the Ukraine. Have we taken leave of our senses? Do we actually want to have a war with Putin? Because if we do, we're certainly going about it the right way.

Perhaps we ought to recognize that the West now faces the biggest threat and crisis to our way of life that we have seen for over 70 years. The recent beheadings of the British and American hostages graphically illustrates the problem, and of course, we have our own citizens from our own countries engaged in that struggle too. In the war against Islamic extremism, Vladimir Putin, whatever we may think of him as a human being, is actually on our side.

I suggest we grow up. I suggest we recognize the real threat facing all of our countries, communities and societies; we stop playing war games in the Ukraine; and we start to prepare a plan to help countries like Syria, like Iraq, like Kenya, like indeed Nigeria, to try and help them to deal with the real threat that faces us. Let us not go on provoking Putin, whether we like him or not.

TUCKER CARLSON: Russia's invasion of Ukraine was the endpoint of a much longer story,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

The war in Ukraine began a year ago today, on February 24, 2022, when the Russian military rolled across the eastern border of their country. But in many ways, the Russian invasion of Ukraine was the endpoint of a much longer story. The propaganda campaign designed to convince Americans to take sides in this conflict — a conflict that has nothing, strictly speaking, to do with them or with America — that effort began many years earlier.

We’d peg it to July 22, 2016. That’s the day that WikiLeaks published thousands of emails from the servers of the Democratic National Committee in Washington. Those emails proved that party officials had rigged the Democratic process, the primary process, in favor of Hillary Clinton, and against the insurgent populist candidate that year, Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Within days, the chair of the DNC, Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, resigned in disgrace. The WikiLeaks scandal broke on the same day that Hillary Clinton chose her running mate, Senator Tim Kaine, and it overshadowed the nominating convention that followed.

But, more significantly, the WikiLeaks scandal threatened to split the Democratic Party into pieces. More than 13 million Bernie Sanders voters, many of them young people, learned that the process they had always believed in, was in fact a sham. They had been cheated.

Democratic leaders had to act quickly in the face of this, to deflect blame from themselves onto someone else. The DNC’s servers, they claimed, had been hacked by the Russian military. The goal was to hurt Hillary Clinton, whom the Russians feared for her strength and wisdom, and to help Donald Trump, whom they controlled. Russia hacked the servers, in order to hack the election. That was their story. The Washington Post ran with it the first day, as if it were true.

SUSSMANN TRIAL PROVES HILLARY CLINTON PERPETRATED ‘MASSIVE FRAUD’, SHOULD BE ‘BANNED FROM TWITTER’: TAIBBI

But there was never any evidence that it was true. Almost seven years later, there is still no evidence. The DNC’s story about its servers is a lie. But, as a political strategy, that lie worked flawlessly. Russia made the perfect villain. It was a White, Christian country with a traditional social structure. It was everything the Democratic Party already opposed. The foreign policy apparatus in Washington was happy to hate Russia again. After 40 years of Cold War, hating Russia was muscle memory.

So, soon the leaders of both parties in Washington signed on to the Russia collusion hoax. It had the twin benefits of paralyzing the Trump administration, which it did, and justifying the expansion of the national security state. As the years passed and the rhetoric intensified, hysteria set in. After awhile, anyone with a heterodox opinion — from right-wingers to avowed-socialists — could be accused of working secretly for Vladimir Putin. Many were accused, and some were destroyed by it. It was a textbook witch-hunt, far more effective than McCarthyism.

And unlike McCarthyism, it never ended. Russia remained America’s greatest enemy, even as China emerged as America’s greatest threat. Over time, the lie that Democrats told to hide their crimes in the 2016 primaries, came to dominate America’s foreign policy, and then to imperil America itself. For generations, statesmen and diplomats worked to prevent other great powers from aligning as a block against the U.S. The idea was pretty straightforward: You might be able to beat one strong country, but if a couple of strong countries ever got together, you would lose. This is why Richard Nixon went to China: to make sure the Chinese government didn’t align with Brezhnev, with the Russians.

CHINA MOCKS BIDEN FOR KNOCKING DOWN BALLOONS WITH FIGHTER JETS: ‘HYSTERICAL,’ ‘LAUGHABLY JUVENILE’

Donald Trump understood this very clearly: ""Russia will never be our closest ally,"" he said. ""But if Russia ever becomes China’s ally, we’re in deep trouble."" The combination of natural resources, military and economic power — and sheer population — would make the Russian-Chinese alliance the most powerful force in the world. The United States would soon be dethroned, we’d be taking orders. As Trump put it, there is no reason to make Russia our enemy and there are many reasons not to.

It was a sound case, but official Washington ignored him. Their response, shouted in unison: ""Shut up Putin stooge."" And then they set about trying to provoke a war with Russia. Now they have succeeded.

But the war we are fighting in Ukraine is not against Russia alone, but also against Russia’s newest ally, the People’s Republic of China. What Donald Trump predicted has happened, and in the worst way. If the war in Ukraine continues, we will lose no matter how it ends. The world order is being reshuffled as we watch, and by the time it’s over, the U.S. will no longer be at the top of the deck. That is very obvious to the rest of the world.

But what’s fascinating is how few Americans seem to understand what's happening or its consequences. But how would they know? No one in American politics or media will tell them the truth. Since the first hours after the invasion, Americans have been fed a steady diet of increasingly absurd lies about Ukraine. Google and Facebook have joined with the Biden administration to censor any factual information that contradicts the official storyline. It’s dystopian.

Joe Biden’s first remarks about the war gave no hint we’d be sending advanced weapons systems and American military advisors to Ukraine, then supporting the entire Ukrainian government and its pension system with hundreds of billions of U.S. tax dollars. No, Joe Biden mentioned only sanctions, which are free. Sanctions he suggested would be enough. Here he is, a year ago today:

PRESIDENT BIDEN 2022: The Russian military has begun a brutal assault on the people of Ukraine without provocation, without justification, without necessity... This aggression cannot go unanswered. If it did, the consequences for America would be much worse. America stands up to bullies. We stand up for freedom... Putin is the aggressor. Putin chose this war, and now he and his country will bear the consequences. Today, I'm authorizing additional strong sanctions.

GOP LAWMAKERS SLAM BIDEN FOR UKRAINE TRIP, NEGLECTING EAST PALESTINE, SOUTHERN BORDER: 'THEY CAN KEEP HIM!'

Strong sanctions. That'll do it. Now, the goal at that point, a year ago today, you may remember this, was to push Russian forces back into their own country to reverse the invasion. And that seemed reasonable to most people. It did not seem like the beginning of a third world war, but it was exactly that. And by December, Lindsey Graham was confident enough to say so out loud. Here he is.

SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM: How does this war end? When Russia breaks and they take Putin out. Anything short of that, the war is going to continue to ask the Ukrainians to give Russia part of their country after all this death and destruction is not going to happen. To signal a cease fire, Russia will take the opportunity to rearm and come at them again. So we're in it to win it and the only way you're going to win it is to break the Russian military and have somebody in Russia take Putin out.

So we're going to, says Lindsey Graham confidently, continue pouring billions into Ukraine until they, ""take Putin out.""

Does Putin know this? Well, we have no idea. We're not allowed to see Russian media in this country. That's too much information for Americans to handle. But if Putin does know that we plan to kill him, wouldn't he fight back with nuclear weapons? Why wouldn't he fight back with nuclear weapons? No one in the United States seems to be allowed to wonder that, much less have a conversation about it out loud.

Instead, we're treated to more lectures about democracy. Ukraine is a democracy, we're told. That's why we're on the side of Ukraine. The problem is that is a lie. Ukraine is not a democracy. Ukraine is a corrupt one-party state. Ukraine has none of the freedoms that define democratic governance: freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, freedom of religion. Ukraine is the least free place in all of Europe and probably for that reason, it is Joe Biden's favorite place.

So for those who understand what is actually happening and what Ukraine is actually like, it is very frustrating to watch Biden say this again and again. It is galling to be lectured about democracy by a man who took power in an election so sketchy that many Americans don't believe it was even real.

Joe Biden has never had the majority of Americans' support for a single day of the Ukraine war. In fact, Joe Biden is far less popular in the United States than Vladimir Putin is in Russia. That is not an endorsement of Putin. It's just true. And it says everything about Joe Biden's tenuous legitimacy. Democracy? Please. We're adults. Stop lying to us.

So what happens next in this war? Well, according to our elderly Treasury secretary Janet Yellen, the war in Ukraine will go on forever, and so will our support for Zelenskyy.

SECRETARY YELLEN: Let me make clear, the United States and the allies, our support for Ukraine will be lasting and is unconditional.

WAR IN UKRAINE: THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF ENERGY AND FOOD ONE YEAR AFTER RUSSIA'S INVASION

Unconditional support for Ukraine. Unconditional support for a nation most Americans know nothing about and couldn't find on a map. Unconditional support – that's a profound statement. Outside of your immediate family how many people would you pledge unconditional support to? How many countries would you pledge unconditional support to? This is insane when you think about it.

But the people in charge of this disaster aren't thinking the way that most Americans do. The Atlantic magazine commemorated the anniversary of the war by commissioning a piece today by Tom Nichols. Nichols is a thoroughly silly foreign policy establishment parasite, who apparently is taken seriously by other ne'er-do-wells and dumb people in Washington. But the piece is fascinating. In it, he inadvertently reveals the point of this war in the clearest possible terms: ""Now we are faced with the long grind of defeating Moscow's armies and eventually rebuilding a better world.""

Oh, defeating Moscow's armies and building a better world. Perfect, thank you, Tom Nichols. Adding those items to this week's to-do list.

Unspecified in the piece is exactly how we plan to do this, how we plan to defeat Russia and its ally, China, and then build utopia. The piece is notably light on details.

Now you'd feel a little better hearing all this if Tom Nichols and others like him in Washington had a track record that suggested they could do any of this, a track record of competence and success. They don't. Nichols himself seems to spend most of his life arguing with other people on Twitter. He's never achieved anything at all that we're aware of, but then virtually none of them have achieved anything. Biden's chief Ukraine strategist, Victoria Nuland – you would not hire her to plan spring break. She couldn't do it. She doesn't have the skills.

BALTIMORE SHOOTING LEAVES 1 DEAD, 5 INJURED, INCLUDING 2 CHILDREN: ‘FIGHTING FOR THEIR LIVES’

Now, these very same people, these demonstrably incompetent people, say they plan to rebuild a better world. All right, that seems ambitious. How about starting with Baltimore before moving on to total global transformation? Shouldn't we fix the biggest city in Maryland first?

Under the leadership of people like Tom Nichols and Victoria Nuland, neoliberal geniuses with grand plans, Baltimore has devolved into third world chaos. But then so has Iraq, so has Libya and so has every other place these people have decided to, ""rebuild.""

It should spur a moment of silence and self-reflection in the U.S. State Department that the moment Western diplomats and NGOs left the country, Afghanistan got safer. There are far fewer killings in Kabul now than there were 18 months ago. Pedestrians in Kabul can walk to dinner at night without being murdered. Now, that fact doesn't tell the whole story of Afghanistan, of course, but we shouldn't ignore that fact. It means something.

If you spend billions trying to make a place better, and it gets worse, you have an obligation to think about why. Maybe you're doing it wrong. Maybe you're not as powerful and clever as you thought you were. Maybe there's a problem with your formula.

But none of this ever occurs to people like Tom Nichols and Victoria Nuland and for that matter, Joe Biden. The more discredited they are, the more self-confident they become. They see every failure as evidence that their talents are more desperately needed than ever. What is this? Well, it's called hubris.

Abbott's invasion declaration without deportation is just catch and release on the state level: Ken Cuccinelli,"Gov. Greg Abbott invoking the U.S. and Texas constitutions' invasion clauses won't change anything if illegal immigrants aren't deported, Ken Cuccinelli, a former Trump administration official, told Fox News.

Abbott announced Tuesday that he invoked the clauses to ""defend our state against an invasion"" to combat the record-setting wave of illegal immigration occurring along the border. The Texas Republican sent a letter to Texas county judges indicating that he would deploy the National Guard and the Texas Department of Public Safety and build a border wall, among other actions.

""If the goal is actually to reduce the harm to Texas, then he needs to start using the invasion authority to return people to Mexico,"" said Ken Cuccinelli, who served as a Department of Homeland Security acting deputy secretary under former President Trump. ""He hasn't done anything but talk about the invasion authority.""

""This is just catch-and-release with state officials,"" Cuccinelli continued. ""Everybody knows an invasion exists, but to actually repel it … means putting people crossing the border back into Mexico.""

The ""invasion clause"" Abbott referenced is Article IV, Section 4 of the U.S. Constitution, which states the U.S. ""shall guarantee every state in this Union a republican form of government and shall protect each of them against invasion.""

""If he acknowledges that there's an invasion occurring, the Constitution has plenty of provisions that not only the federal government has a duty, but the states, the governor of each state, has a duty to repel any invasion that occurs,"" Kinney County Attorney Brent Smith told Fox News.

""The next step is fulfilling the duty as the governor to repel it,"" Smith continued.

Cuccinelli said Abbott should boat immigrants who cross into the U.S. illegally back to Mexico.

Also on Tuesday, DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas maintained the border is secure while giving testimony before the House Committee on Homeland Security, and Customs and Border Patrol announced that there were 230,000 border encounters in October — an all-time record.

Later that day, a federal judge issued an order barring federal authorities from using Title 42, a Trump-era rule that allowed the U.S. to quickly expel migrants who crossed the border.

Abbott's office did not return a request for comment.

Arizona AG Brnovich issues legal opinion declaring border crisis 'invasion' under Constitution,"Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich on Monday issued a legal opinion that determines that the ongoing crisis at the southern border is an ""invasion"" under the Constitution – a move he says gives the state the power to take additional measures to defend itself.

In the opinion, Brnovich says that the definition of ""invasion"" contained under the U.S. Constitution is not limited to hostile foreign states, and can include ""hostile non-state actors.""

HARRIS SAYS EFFECTS OF BIDEN MIGRATION POLICY WON'T BE SEEN ‘OVERNIGHT,’ AS BORDER CRISIS RAGE

""The violence and lawlessness at the border caused by transnational cartels and gangs satisfies the definition of an ‘invasion’ under the U.S. Constitution, and Arizona therefore has the power to defend itself from this invasion under the Governor’s authority as Commander-in-Chief,"" Brnovich writes. ""An actual invasion permits the State to engage in defensive actions within its own territory at or near its border.""

The opinion comes after Republican state lawmakers and former Trump officials -- including former Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Russ Vought and former acting deputy DHS Secretary Ken Cuccinelli, both now at the Center for Renewing America -- urged Gov. Doug Ducey to use war powers to repel the enormous number of migrants that have hit Arizona’s border with Mexico in the last year. It would in theory allow Arizona’s police or National Guard to remove illegal immigrants to Mexico themselves.



They have pointed to language in Article I of the Constitution, which allows for States to ""engage in War"" when it has been ""actually invaded, or in such imminent Danger as will not admit of delay"" without the approval of Congress. They also note Article IV says the U.S. ""shall protest each [state] against invasion.""

There were more than 1.7 million migrant apprehensions in FY 2021, and the numbers remained high into December, where there were 178.840 encounters at the border, amid fears that the crisis will likely continue well into 2022 at least. Arizona’s Yuma Sector has been particularly overwhelmed by the surge in migrants.

""The on-the-ground violence and lawlessness at Arizona’s border caused by cartels and gangs is extensive, well-documented, and persistent. It can satisfy the definition of ""actually invaded"" and ""invasion"" under the U.S. Constitution,"" Brnovich’s opinion says.

While the Biden administration has focused on an explanation of the crisis that centers on ""root causes"" like violence and corruption in Central America, Republicans at state and national level have blamed the Biden administration’s rolling back of Trump-era border policies and of having left states to fend for themselves.

""No State should be put in the position that Arizona and other border states have been put in through the federal government’s recent actions,"" Brnovich writes.

He goes on to argue that ""invasion"" does not necessarily require foreign states and can instead include hostile foreign actors -- including transnational gangs and cartels bringing violence and drugs like fentanyl to the border.

ARIZONA GOV. DUCEY SAYS BIDEN'S BORDER POLICY SERVES AS ‘MARKETING ARM’ OF MEXICAN CARTELS

""Furthermore, the commonly understood meaning at the time of the word ""invade"" covers the activities of the transnational cartels and gangs at the border—they enter Arizona ""in [a] hostile manner""; they ""enter as an enemy, with a view to ... plunder""; they ""attack,"" ""assail,"" and ""assault""; and they ""infringe,"" ""encroach on,"" and ""violate"" Arizona,"" he said.

However, Brnovich notes that it will ultimately up to the governor of the state to make a determination whether the State is able to use its powers under the State Self-Defense Clause and that ""only the Governor has the authority to establish the exact parameters for the exercise of the defensive use of force.""

Cuccinelli told Fox News that it was a ""big deal"" for Brnovich to come to the conclusion he did.

""Now we call on Gov. Doug Ducey to use this very clear legal and constitutional authority to protect the people of Arizona from the invasion they're suffering through their southern border,"" he said.

""It's not enough for states like Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California to complain about Joe Biden's failure to do his job, they have the authority to protect themselves,"" he said. ""Only governors Abbot and Ducey have spoken about doing that. But here is confirmation that they have legal authority to take matters into their own hands and solve the problem, not just complain about it.""

Ducey himself has been highly critical of the Biden administration’s border policies. In a recent interview with Fox News Digital, he said there was a link between rising crime and the influx of migrants into the U.S.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

""Well, of course, there's a link between criminals coming over the border and rising crime – of that, there's no doubt,"" he said. ""We've got nearly two million people that we've apprehended at this time. So, border security is national security. The federal government is failing at that.""

In a statement in response to the opinion published on Monday, Ducey's office noted his deployment of the National Guard to the border and that he extended the border security mission for another year in August – while calling the amount of drugs and migrants coming across the border ""unprecedented.""

""DHS Secretary [Alejandro] Mayorkas admitted himself the border is the worst it’s been in over 20 years. He needs to be held accountable. This administration needs to be held accountable. They have totally failed to address this very real public safety and humanitarian crisis,"" Communications Director CJ Karamargin said.



""Arizona has and will continue to protect our communities with our National Guard, our Border Strike Force and in partnership with local law enforcement,"" Karamargin said. ""For Attorney General Brnovich to imply the Guard is not on our border does them a serious disservice and shows that he fails to appreciate the commitment these men and women have to protecting Arizona.""

Arizona AG Brnovich urges Gov. Ducey to declare border crisis an ‘invasion’,"Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich is urging Gov. Doug Ducey to declare the crisis at the southern border an ""invasion"" -- just after multiple counties in Texas are pressuring their state’s governor to do the same.

""Last year, your office deployed the National Guard and declared a state of emergency at our border, but as the Biden-made disaster continues to intensify, there are more actions that we now have to consider,"" Brnovich said in a letter to Ducey, obtained by Fox News Digital.

Amid an ongoing and historic migrant crisis at the southern border, with more than 239,000 migrant apprehensions in May alone, states have been taking matters into their own hands after what they say is inaction from the federal government.

Brnovich noted the recent case of an illegal immigrant who was on the terror watch list, but was still released into the country, before being apprehended two weeks later.

HOUSE REPUBLICANS BACK TEXAS COUNTIES' ‘INVASION’ DECLARATION IN RESPONSE TO BORDER CRISIS

With the state’s abilities limited, a number of conservatives have been calling for border states to declare the situation an ""invasion"" -- which could give them additional powers under the Constitution. This week, multiple counties in Texas declared the crisis an invasion, and urged Gov. Greg Abbott to do the same.

""We want America to know that this is real,"" Kinney County Judge Tully Shahan told reporters. ""The Biden administration won't do a thing about it. They could stop this thing this hour. They could stop it now. They don't have the guts.""

Multiple lawmakers at the national level have come out in support of the move, including Arizona Rep. Andy Biggs, who said: ""Arizona must declare an invasion at its southern border.""

The call for invasion declarations has been promoted since last year by former Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Russ Vought and former acting deputy DHS Secretary Ken Cuccinelli, both now at the Center for Renewing America. They have cited language in Article I of the Constitution, which allows for States to ""engage in War"" when it has been ""actually invaded, or in such imminent Danger as will not admit of delay"" without the approval of Congress.

TEXAS COUNTIES ON THE BORDER AND BEYOND DECLARE ‘INVASION': BIDEN ADMIN DOESN'T ‘HAVE THE GUTS’ TO ACT

Brnovich, in February, issued a legal opinion declaring the crisis an invasion and finding that it authorized the state to take matters into its own hands -- but only if the governor made the declaration.

""Our office concluded that violence by cartels and gangs who have now assumed control of our southern border meets the legal definition for an invasion, but it’s up to the Governor to make that actual determination,"" Brnovich, who is also running for U.S. Senate, said in the letter. ""If that happens, you, as Commander in Chief, can exercise independent authority under the State Self-Defense Clause of the Constitution to defend Arizona from the invasion.""

CHIP ROY UNLEASHES ON BIDEN ADMIN'S BORDER POLICIES: ‘WE’RE DEALING WITH AN INVASION, TEXANS ARE DYING'

""The truth is that we have every indication that the border crisis will continue to escalate,"" he said. If there is more that we as a state can and should do, it can be pursued with your declaration of an ‘invasion’ at our southern border.""

Ducey’s office in February had responded to Brnovich’s declaration by noting the efforts the state had taken to address the crisis, including its Border Strike Force, National Guard, and partnership with local law enforcement.

""Governor Ducey deployed the National Guard to the border last April, as we faced a rapid increase in apprehensions. He extended the border security mission for another year in August to give our law enforcement the support they need to fight this criminal activity,"" Communications Director CJ Karamargin said.

""The number of people and drugs we have seen come across our border this year is unprecedented. DHS Secretary Mayorkas admitted himself the border is the worst it’s been in over 20 years. He needs to be held accountable. This administration needs to be held accountable. They have totally failed to address this very real public safety and humanitarian crisis,"" he said.

On Thursday, Vought at the Center for Renewing America welcomed the letter from Brnovich.

"Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake eyes invasion declaration, sweeping border moves if elected","Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake is promising to declare an ""invasion"" at the southern border if elected to lead the state in November, one of a number of aggressive moves she intends to take to combat the raging migrant crisis.

The Trump-backed former news anchor secured the Republican nomination earlier this month in a state where the migrant crisis has taken a heavy toll. Recent data obtained by Fox News show that Yuma Sector has seen a 242% increase in encounters so far this fiscal year.

With a crisis in both Arizona and Texas, Lake has joined the growing number of voices calling to declare an invasion at the southern border, a move proponents have argued would give the governor additional powers to deal with the crisis under the Constitution.

""This is the biggest invasion we've ever had on our homeland since the founding of this country,"" Lake told Fox News Digital in an interview. ""And so we're going to call it what it is.

NYC, DC SANCTUARY CITY POLICIES COME BACK TO HAUNT THEM AMID FEUD WITH TEXAS, ARIZONA

""It's also important to call it what it is for our policy as well. We're going to be invoking our inherent powers under Article I, Section 10 of the U.S. Constitution to defend ourselves from the invasion in lieu of the federal government reneging on their guarantees to protect us under the Guarantee Clause, Article IV, Section IV.

""So we will issue a declaration of invasion, and we will take on those powers that are granted to us in the U.S. Constitution, and we will take care of the problem at our border.""

HOUSE REPUBLICANS BACK TEXAS COUNTIES' ‘INVASION’ DECLARATION IN RESPONSE TO BORDER CRISIS

The movement for invasion declarations has been brewing since the start of the crisis, initiated by former Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Russ Vought and former acting deputy DHS Secretary Ken Cuccinelli, both now at the Center for Renewing America.

They have pointed to the language in the Constitution, which allows for states to ""engage in War"" when they have been ""actually invaded, or in such imminent Danger as will not admit of delay"" without the approval of Congress.

Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich issued a legal opinion declaring the crisis an invasion and argued that the definition of ""invasion"" in the U.S. Constitution is not limited to hostile foreign states and can include ""hostile non-state actors.""

Meanwhile, in Texas, a number of county officials have issued their own declarations. So far, neither Abbott nor Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey has made a formal invasion declaration, meaning a declaration by Lake next year as governor would be the first such move by a border governor.

""A lot of people here in Arizona are very concerned with the number of people coming across,"" she told Fox News Digital.

""They're taking jobs, and they're driving down wages for our middle class. And there's been no interest in any leader to do something serious about it and stand up for the people of their state. That's going to change in January of '23 when I take office. We're going to put the needs of our Arizona residents first.""

Vought, at the Center for Renewing America, welcomed the pledge by Lake to declare an invasion.

""Americans should be thrilled that Kari Lake has committed to declare an invasion on Day 1 in office,"" Vought said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""With a Biden administration committed to an open border, it’s incumbent on border governors to protect their people.""

Lake’s border policy calls for the invasion declaration to be accompanied by an interstate compact with ""like-minded states"" to work together and share resources, including the creation of a dedicated border security force to arrest, detain and return illegal immigrants. Lake would also look to invalidate federal regulations on border enforcement.

SHOULD NEW YORK GIVE MIGRANTS FREE LUXURY HOTEL ROOMS? AMERICANS WEIGH IN

Republian Gov. Ducey has deployed the National Guard and recently started filling gaps in the border wall with welded shipping containers. Lake wants to enhance the National Guard presence and complete the border wall. She vowed to veto any budget that doesn’t include funding for it.

""The federal government canceled the contracts and left the materials sitting there on the border. So we're going to redefine them as abandoned, take them back and use them to complete the wall,"" she said. ""I want to complete President Trump's border wall project. I believe … there's somewhere between 20 and 27 miles left, and I think we can finish that rather quickly.""

Lake’s campaign page lists a lengthy list of sweeping border policies she intends to implement. Lake wants to create a criminal illegal alien database and a special border court and also strip state funding from municipalities that declare themselves ""sanctuary"" jurisdictions. Her plan also allows law enforcement to arrest illegal immigrants and traffickers for trespassing and expands the National Guard's mission to allow it to destroy cartel tunnels and shoot down drones from Mexico.

She also wants to take additional measures to target criminal cartels that she says have ""complete operational control"" of the border and that are facilitating a massive influx of deadly illicit fentanyl into the United States. Her plan includes a carveout to allow law enforcement to seize cartel property.

""We're going to ask the legislature to modify our civil asset forfeiture legislation to allow law enforcement broader authority to crack down on cartel operations,"" Lake told Fox. ""We're going to call them what they are — terrorist organizations — and go after them as we would go after terrorists.""

However, she was less enthused by the moves by Ducey and Abbott to send busses of migrants to Washington, D.C., and New York City, calling it a ""cute, fun photo op.""

""But I'm not for taking people who are here illegally, putting them on busses and shipping them around this country. That sounds like something Joe Biden would do,"" she said. ""It is something Joe Biden is doing. We're just moving people who shouldn't be here further into the country and it makes it harder to track them down. So I am not for that.""

She did say, however, that she’s enjoyed watching the outrage from New York City Mayor Eric Adams.

""I think it does get our point across, and I've enjoyed watching the mayor of New York freak out over this. And it's like, 'OK, now you know what we're dealing with.' So I think our point has been, 'They've gotten the point, and now it's time to just be serious about this and stop additional people from coming across that border.'""",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/arizona-gubernatorial-candidate-kari-lake-eyes-invasion-declaration-sweeping-border-moves-elected,N/A
"Biden announces Russia sanctions, troop movements in response to Ukraine invasion","President Biden on Tuesday announced new sanctions against Russia, calling Kremlin-led activities in recent hours ""the beginning of a Russian invasion of Ukraine,"" and the authorization of additional U.S. forces to the region, but maintained that the United States has ""no intention"" of fighting Russia.

The president, from the White House on Tuesday, said Russian President Vladimir Putin is ""setting up a rationale"" to take Ukrainian territory ""by force,"" after authorizing Russian forces to deploy into the country.

""I know he’s setting up a rationale to go much further,"" Biden said. ""This is the beginning of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.""

BIDEN SAYS RUSSIA IS BEGINNING AN INVASION, ANNOUNCES SANCTIONS: LIVE UPDATES

The president said he will impose further sanctions on Russia, which go ""far beyond"" the steps taken by the United States and allies and partners in 2014.

""And if Russia goes further with this invasion, we stand prepared to go further as with sanctions,"" he said.

""Who in the Lord’s name does Putin think gives him the right to declare new so-called countries on territory that belongs to his neighbors?"" Biden said. ""This is a flagrant violation of international law and demands a firm response from the international community.""

Biden maintained that the United States is working with NATO allies and partners to implement sanctions, saying they have been ""closely coordinated,"" and will ""continue to escalate"" if Russia ""escalates.""

WHITE HOUSE DECLARES RUSSIAN INVASION IN UKRAINE

Biden said the United States is implementing sanctions that block two large Russian financial institutions – VEB and its military bank – and implementing comprehensive sanctions on Russian sovereign debt.

""That means we’ve cut off Russia’s government from Western financing. It can no longer raise money from the West and cannot trade in its new debt on our markets or European markets either,"" Biden explained.

The Biden administration is also set to impose sanctions on Russia’s ""elites and their family members,"" which the White House teased earlier this month. Biden said they ""share in the corrupt gains of the Kremlin policy and should share the pain as well.""

Biden went on to say that the U.S. will work with Germany to ""ensure Nord Stream 2 will not, as I promised, will not move forward.""

Germany overnight said it is taking steps to halt the process of certifying the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia over Moscow’s latest actions in eastern Ukraine.

The 764-mile pipeline that would carry natural gas from Russia to Germany has not begun operating. Nord Stream 2 is owned and operated by a wholly owned subsidiary of Russia state company Gazprom.

The Nord Stream 2 has seen a faster development and deployment despite sanctions placed on it by the Trump administration. With those sanctions removed, Germany remains keen to see the pipeline activated sooner rather than later.

Biden last year removed sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, allowing construction and activation to proceed.

But Biden said that as Russia ""contemplates its next move,"" the United States has its next move prepared as well, saying that the United States ""will continue to provide defensive assistance to Ukraine,"" and will continue to ""reinforce and reassure our NATO allies.""

""In response to Russia’s admission that it will not withdraw its forces from Belarus, I have authorized additional movements of U.S. forces and equipment already stationed in Europe to strengthen our Baltic allies Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania,"" Biden announced.

""Let me be clear: these are totally defensive moves on our part,"" he continued. ""We have no intention of fighting Russia.""

Biden said, however, that the U.S. wants to ""send an unmistakable message"" that the United States and allies ""will defend every inch of NATO territory and abide by the commitments we made to NATO.""

""We still believe that Russia is poised to go much further in launching a massive military attack against Ukraine—I hope I’m wrong about that. I hope we’re wrong about that,"" Biden said, noting that there are still well over 150,000 Russian troops surrounding Ukraine.

""Russian forces remain positioned in Belarus to attack Ukraine from the north, including warplanes and offensive missile systems,"" Biden said, noting that Russia is moving supplies of ""blood and medical equipment into position at the border.""

""You don’t need blood unless you plan on starting a war,"" Biden said.

The president said that Russian activities in the last several days mirror what Secretary of State Antony Blinken previewed last week at the United Nations Security Council— detailing false flag events that have been ""dramatically"" staged.

""President Putin has sought authorization from the Russian parliament to use military force outside of Russian territory, and this set the stage for further pretext of further provocations by Russia to try to justify further military action,"" Biden said. ""None of us, none of us, should be fooled. None of us will be fooled. There is no justification.""

He added: ""Further Russian assault of Ukraine remains a severe threat in the days ahead.""

Biden, shifting to how the situation abroad will affect those in the homeland, said that his administration will use ""every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers from rising prices at the pump.""

""Defending freedom will have cost for us as well, and here at home, we need to be honest about that,"" the president said. ""But, as we do this, I’m going to take robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions is targeted to the Russian economy—not ours.""

Biden said his administration is ""closely monitoring"" energy supplies to prevent disruption, and is executing a plan and coordination with major oil producing consumers.

""This will blunt gas prices,"" Biden said. ""I want to limit the pain that the American people are feeling at the gas pump—this is critical to me.""

Meanwhile, Biden, delivering a direct message to Putin, said the U.S. and allies are ""united in our support of Ukraine"" and in ""our opposition to Russian aggression"" and in ""resolve to defend our NATO alliance.""

""And we’re united in our understanding of the urgency and seriousness of the threat Russia is making to global peace and stability,"" Biden said, slamming Putin for ""directly"" attacking ""Ukraine’s right to exist.""

""He explicitly threatened war unless his extreme demands were met, and there is no question that Russia is the aggressor,"" Biden said. ""So, we’re clear-eyed about the challenges we’re facing.""

But Biden said that there is ""still time to avert the worst case scenario,"" and left the door open for diplomacy ""if it is serious.""

""When all is said and done, we’re going to judge Russia by its actions, not its words,"" Biden said. ""And whatever Russia does next, we're ready to respond with unity, clarity and conviction.""

He added: ""I’m hoping diplomacy is still available.""

The president’s comments came after Putin, on Tuesday during a press conference, called on Ukraine to demilitarize.

Putin’s demands came after Russian troops arrived in eastern Ukraine—just hours after he announced that he would recognize the independence of two separatist regions, officials said.

Russian troops entered in Donbas, the name for the area where the two separatist regions, that have long fought Russia-backed rebels, Donetsk and Luhansk, are located, officials said, noting that they ""consider Donbas part of Ukraine.""

The Kremlin then raised the stakes further Tuesday, by saying that recognition extends even to parts held by Ukrainian forces.

A White House official told Fox News that administration officials are calling it an invasion.

China could invade Taiwan before the 2024 US presidential election: sources,"EXCLUSIVE: China could invade Taiwan within the next 18 months, current and former officials familiar with U.S. and allied intelligence told Fox News, suggesting a particularly ""dangerous"" window between the meeting of the National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party this November and the next U.S. presidential election in 2024.

Two former senior officials told Fox News that the intelligence suggests China sees the potential opportunity for an amphibious assault and military invasion of Taiwan in that time frame.

""We have always had and always been aware that China has an ever-present, ever-evolving plan for an amphibious assault and military invasion of Taiwan. If they are not successful in reunifying politically, then they will do so with force,"" one former senior intelligence official familiar with U.S. intelligence, and who has discussed intelligence belonging to a U.S. ally in the Indo-Pacific, told Fox News.

""What is different now is, we have intelligence that this has gone from an indefinite, nebulous scenario, to a belief that there is a window of opportunity in the next 18 months,"" the official continued. ""I don’t think that’s a coincidence that window of opportunity is within a Biden administration.""

WHITE HOUSE: US 'DOES NOT WANT A CRISIS' BUT WILL 'MANAGE WHAT BEIJING CHOOSES TO DO' AMID PELOSI TAIWAN VISIT

A former senior Trump administration official told Fox News House Speaker Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan is being used as a ""pretext"" for increased Chinese aggression around Taiwan, but said it is ""not the real cause of it,"" and warned that the ""Davidson Window"" is ""closing.""

Former commander of American forces in the Indo-Pacific Adm. Philip Davison testified last year that China could invade Taiwan within the next six years—by 2027.

""The window is now between the Party Congress and the next U.S. presidential election,"" the official said noting that window could close by January 2025—at the end of the presidential transition period. ""I think we are in a very dangerous two-year window right now.""

The 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party is expected to take place in November, where Chinese President Xi Jinping is expected to be re-elected.

A spokesperson for the White House National Security Council told Fox News that the United States ""will not seek and does not want a crisis.""

""We are prepared to manage what Beijing chooses to do. We will not engage in saber-rattling, and we're not looking to escalate,"" the NSC spokesperson told Fox News. ""At the same time, we're going to be steady and resolute. We will not be deterred from operating in the seas and skies of the Western Pacific as we have done for decades.""

The spokesperson added that the United States ""will continue to support Taiwan, consistent with our commitments under the Taiwan Relations Act, and defend a free and open Indo-Pacific.""

""We're communicating closely with our allies and partners. And we are maintaining open lines of communication Beijing,"" the spokesperson said. ""We will keep doing what we are doing -- supporting cross-Strait peace and stability.""

However, the former senior Trump administration official told Fox News that ""the likelihood of invasion has increased dramatically with China perceiving the United States is in a weakened position,"" pointing to the Biden administration’s ""surrender"" of Afghanistan to the Taliban in August 2021 and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which resulted ""in only half-measure sanctions being put on the Russian Federation.""

PENTAGON OFFICIAL SAYS 'ONLY A MATTER OF TIME' BEFORE CHINA CAUSES 'MAJOR' INCIDENT IN INDO-PACIFIC REGION

The official also said Xi has been emboldened by U.S. ""domestic problems,"" including crime in cities across the nation, ""the lack of control"" at the Southern border, and the ""failures"" of the Biden administration’s energy policy.

The official stressed that the invasion could happen before the inauguration of the next president in 2025, saying China fears the election of ""another leader that could return to a more robust, ‘peace through strength’ foreign policy and stronger domestic policies.""

With regard to criticisms of the current administration's foreign policy and its withdrawal from Afghanistan, a Biden administration official told Fox News that China ""would love nothing more than for the U.S. government to still be bogged down in a 20-year war, still committing billions of dollars, U.S. troops, and have our military focused on another country's civil war.

""By being able to withdraw our forces from Afghanistan, we have been able to reposition them and refocus our efforts to other areas of the world,"" the official said. The official added that the Biden administration ""freed up resources"" and said leaving Afghanistan put the United States ""in a much better position on the geopolitical stage when it comes to our strategic competition with China or with any other important issues around the world.""

However, during an interview with Fox News Wednesday, Former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for East Asia Heino Klinck said the United States ""has failed to deter adversaries within the last 18 months.""

""If anything, the United States has been deterred from forcefully supporting its partners and allies worldwide,"" Klinck said, adding that he has viewed 2024 as a ""particularly dangerous year.""

""The reason is because it is not only the election in the United States, but it is also the presidential election in Taiwan,"" Klinck said, stressing that he believes the People’s Liberation Army ""will move against Taiwan when the Chinese Communist Party tells it to, regardless of timing.""

""I view 2024 as being dangerous because I believe the CCP, particularly President Xi Jinping, will see it as a potential window of opportunity because of the U.S. election, and the fact that he probably perceives that the United States is going to shy away from an international crisis during a presidential election,"" he told Fox News.

Klinck, who also formerly served as a U.S. military attaché at the U.S. embassy in Beijing, currently serves as a senior advisor to the National Bureau of Asian Research.

""I also believe he perceives that the presumptive next Taiwanese president is going to move Taiwan closer to independence,"" he said.

CHINA POSES 'BIGGEST LONG-TERM THREAT TO ECONOMIC AND NATIONAL SECURITY,' FBI DIRECTOR WRAY WARNS

Current Biden administration officials told Fox News that the situation is fluid and that they are monitoring closely as China gears up for ""potential escalation."" Officials said they are looking to see how the situation will play out over the coming months and how far China will go.

Officials say they are focusing on what the heightened threat could mean for Taiwan, for U.S.-Chinese relations, and for certain critical industries that could be impacted.

White House National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications John Kirby said Tuesday that even before Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan this week, Beijing ""positioned itself to take further steps, and we expect that they will continue to react over a longer-term horizon.""

At this point, the Chinese have declared several closure areas around Taiwan for military exercises, and Klinck told Fox News that some of those closure areas ""encroach upon Taiwanese territorial waters.""

Klinck told Fox News that this is the first time the military exercises are taking place east of Taiwan.

MILLEY DIRECTS A REVIEW OF US, CHINESE MILITARY CONTACTS, AMID WARNING BEIJING POSES NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT

""The Chinese are trying to say to Taiwan, you don’t have any territorial waters because you belong to us, and they are going to make the point now by conducting exercises there, and they have never done that before,"" Klinck said. ""They have previously declared closure areas and conducted exercises there. They have never done it though on the east side of Taiwan.""

Biden administration officials have been warning for months of increased Chinese aggression, with one top Pentagon official last month sounding the alarm that it is ""only a matter of time"" before a ""major incident or accident"" occurs in the Indo-Pacific.

Assistant Secretary for Defense for Indo-Pacific Security Affairs Ely Ratner said last month that the Pentagon has witnessed a ""sharp increase"" in aggressive behavior by the PLA in the Indo-Pacific, admitting that it has ""increased dramatically, with dozens of dangerous events in the first half of this year alone.""

The warnings from the Pentagon come just days after Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley directed his staff to collect information on interactions between the U.S. and Chinese militaries in the last five years.

GOP House leaders say Biden’s policies enabled Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,"GOP House leaders on Tuesday took President Biden to task over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, arguing that the president’s failed policies have emboldened Vladimir Putin to take more aggressive actions.

The statement from House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy and others came a day after Russian troops rolled into rebel-held areas in eastern Ukraine after Putin said he was recognizing the areas’ independence. GOP leaders called the renewed invasion of Ukraine ""reprehensible.""

""Sadly, President Biden consistently chose appeasement and his tough talk on Russia was never followed by strong action,"" GOP leaders said.

""Lethal aid was slow-walked, anti-air and anti-ship capabilities were never directly provided, pre-invasion sanctions proportionate to the aggression Putin had already committed were never imposed, and sanctions on Nord Stream 2 were waived.""

The Nord Stream 2 undersea pipeline directly links Russian gas to Europe via Germany and is complete but not yet operating. It has become a major target as Western governments try to exert leverage on Russia to deter further military moves against its neighbors.

GOP leaders said the U.S. and its allies must make the Putin regime ""pay for this aggression."" They called on President Biden to take a more aggressive approach in curbing Putin’s ambitions.

TRUMP SAYS CHINA ‘ABSOLUTELY’ GOING AFTER TAIWAN AFTER RUSSIA-UKRAINE ‘DISASTER’

""[W]e must permanently end Nord Stream 2, implement secondary sanctions on Russian financial institutions, and impose crippling penalties on the industries which the Russian military relies on to make war,"" GOP leaders said. ""Moreover, as House Republicans have been saying for a year, President Biden must finally promote U.S. energy development and help the United States become Europe’s energy partner of choice.""

The letter was signed by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik, House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Mike Turner, House Foreign Affairs Committee Ranking Member Michael McCaul of Texas and Ranking Member of the Armed Services Committee Mike Rogers of Alabama.

Later Tuesday, President Biden ordered heavy U.S. sanctions against Russian banks and oligarchs. Speaking from the White House, Biden accused Putin of flagrantly violating international law and promised that more sanctions would be coming if Putin proceeds further.

""None of us will be fooled"" by Putin's claims about Ukraine, the U.S. president said.

Biden said he was also moving additional U.S. troops to the Baltic States on NATO's eastern flank bordering Russia. The prime minister of Estonia and presidents of Latvia and Lithuania on Friday had made a direct plea to Vice President Kamala Harris for the U.S. to step up its presence in the Baltics.

Biden said the U.S. would impose ""full blocking"" on two large Russian financial institutions and ""comprehensive sanctions"" on Russian debt.

""That means we've cut off Russia's government from Western finance,"" Biden said. ""It can no longer raise money from the West and cannot trade in its new debt on our markets or European markets either.""

Hackers targeted US energy companies ahead of Ukraine invasion: source,"Nearly two dozen American companies involved with liquefied natural gas production were attacked by hackers in early February – two weeks prior to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Fox News has learned.

A source familiar with the intelligence told Fox News that 21 American companies, including Chevron Corporation and Cheniere Energy, were targeted two weeks before Russia launched its multi-front war on Ukraine.

RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency is working to confirm that the attacks emanated from Russia, but the source told Fox News it is believed that this hack marked the first stage of Russia’s effort to destabilize the U.S. energy industry.

The source told Fox News that the computers belonging to current and former employees were hacked during the attack.

""Chevron takes the threat of malicious cyber activity seriously,"" A Chevron spokesperson told Fox News. ""We have implemented the United States government's recommendations into our cybersecurity safeguards to protect Chevron's computing environment.""

Cheniere did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.

President Biden on Tuesday announced a ban on all imports of Russian oil, gas and energy to the United States, targeting the ""main artery"" of Russia's economy amid Russian President Vladimir Putin's war on Ukraine. Russia is the third-largest producer of oil in the world.

The U.S. intelligence community in January assessed that Russia would remain a ""top cyber threat"" in 2022 as it refines and employs its espionage, influence and attack capabilities.

RUSSIA 'DOES NOT WANT A DIRECT CONFLICT WITH US FORCES,' INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY ASSESSED IN JANUARY

""We assess that Russia views cyber disruptions as a foreign policy lever to shape other countries’ decisions, as well as a deterrence and military tool,"" states the intelligence community's annual threat assessment report, released Tuesday.

The intelligence community found that Russia is particularly focused on improving its ability ""to target critical infrastructure, including underwater cables and industrial control systems"" in the United States, as well as in U.S. allied and partner countries. The IC found that Russia’s successful compromise of that infrastructure would demonstrate Russia’s ""ability to damage infrastructure during a crisis.""

The IC, at the time, said Russia is also using cyber operations to ""attack entities it sees as working to undermine its interests or threaten the stability of the Russian Government.""

This week, New York state said it is facing ""increased risk"" of cyberattacks from Russian retaliators, with NYPD officials warning that New York City is on ""ultra-high alert.""

In mid-February, Russia was suspected of launching cyberattacks that brought down websites belonging to Ukraine’s Ministry of Defense, army and popular banks, a move officials, at the time, called the ""largest"" of its kind in the history of Ukraine. The Kremlin denied Russian involvement.

Just a week later, on Feb. 24 Russia launched its multi-front war against Ukraine.

Meanwhile, a government source told Fox News that CISA and the FBI are working with an unnamed American pharmaceutical company whose top executives have been targeted by Russian intelligence operatives in ongoing ""malicious phishing attacks.""

The U.S. government has attributed these cyberattacks to a Federal Security Service training site in Nizhniy Novgorod.

Fox News has learned that those attacks began last week.

Last month, the Department of Homeland Security warned U.S. organizations at all levels that they could face cyberthreats stemming from the Russia-Ukraine conflict.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: INTEL OFFICIALS PREDICT 'UGLY' WEEKS AHEAD AS PUTIN DOUBLES DOWN

The Biden administration has worked to strengthen cyber defenses after a string of ransomware attacks last summer, with foreign malign actors targeting pieces of U.S. critical infrastructure.

In June 2021, a ransomware assault shut down the U.S.-based meat plants of the world’s largest meatpacker, Brazil-based JBS. The White House said the hack was likely carried out by a criminal group based in Russia.

The attack on JBS came just weeks after the largest U.S. fuel pipeline, the East Coast's Colonial Pipeline, was targeted by a criminal group originating in Russia.

Biden said he gave a list of ""16 specific entities defined as critical infrastructure,"" saying it ranged from energy to water systems.

House Republicans back Texas counties' 'invasion' declaration in response to border crisis,"A number of House Republicans are backing the move by a number of Texas counties to declare the situation at the southern border an ""invasion"" -- as border states face overwhelming migrant numbers.

""It’s a sad day when local leaders have to effectively declare themselves a Sanctuary County for the law-abiding citizen,"" Rep. Jodey Arrington, R-Texas, said in a statement to Fox News Digital. "" That’s the new reality under a derelict President who has ceded control of our sovereign border to narco-terrorist cartels and abandoned the American people.""

Officials from several Texas counties on Tuesday declared the migrant crisis an invasion. The declarations are likely to put further pressure on Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to make a statewide declaration, which some conservatives believe would give the state the authority to return migrants across the border.

""We want America to know that this is real,"" Kinney County Judge Tully Shahan told reporters. ""The Biden administration won't do a thing about it. They could stop this thing this hour. They could stop it now. They don't have the guts.""

TEXAS COUNTIES ON THE BORDER AND BEYOND DECLARE ‘INVASION': BIDEN ADMIN DOESN'T ‘HAVE THE GUTS’ TO ACT

The move by the Texas counties drew praise from Republican lawmakers, particularly those who have been sounding the alarm on the crisis for months. Arrington had introduced a resolution last year which affirmed the rights of states to defend themselves against drug cartels working across the border.

Rep. Jim Banks, head of the Republican Study Committee, had supported that resolution, and said that counties had ""no other choice"" than to take action themselves due to lack of movement from the federal government.

""Earlier this year I called on every House Republican to support my colleague Rep. Jodey Arrington’s resolution reaffirming the constitutional right for border states to defend their communities against invasion,"" Banks said in a statement. ""The Biden administration’s refusal to enforce America’s immigration laws has left state and local jurisdictions no other choice than to step in to defend our border and national sovereignty.""

Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, who had appeared alongside the county officials on Tuesday, told Fox News’ ""America’s Newsroom"" that Lonestar State officials were stepping up where the Biden administration was failing.

""We are dealing with an invasion ,"" he said. ""We are dealing with Texans dying from fentanyl pouring into our communities. Our ranchers are getting overrun, their livestock are getting out, their fences are getting cut. Our communities are dealing with that. So all of these leaders in the counties in south Texas are asking for is that Texas step up, and we go do what the federal government refuses to do.""

The official House Republican Twitter account tweeted that ""President Biden’s open-border policies have incentivized an invasion.""

""Americans deserve an open border,"" it said.

CHIP ROY UNLEASHES ON BIDEN ADMIN'S BORDER POLICIES: ‘WE’RE DEALING WITH AN INVASION, TEXANS ARE DYING'

The push for invasion declarations has been promoted since last year by former Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Russ Vought and former acting deputy DHS Secretary Ken Cuccinelli, both now at the Center for Renewing America.

They have pointed to language in Article I of the Constitution, which allows for States to ""engage in War"" when it has been ""actually invaded, or in such imminent Danger as will not admit of delay"" without the approval of Congress. They also note Article IV says the U.S. ""shall protect each [state] against invasion.""

The push paid off in February, when Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich issued a legal opinion declaring the crisis an invasion and argued that the definition of ""invasion"" contained under the U.S. Constitution is not limited to hostile foreign states, and can include ""hostile non-state actors.""

""The violence and lawlessness at the border caused by transnational cartels and gangs satisfies the definition of an ‘invasion’ under the U.S. Constitution, and Arizona therefore has the power to defend itself from this invasion under the Governor’s authority as Commander-in-Chief,"" Brnovich wrote.

Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., this week called for Arizona to officially declare an invasion at the border.

""Arizona must declare an invasion at its southern border. The definition of ‘invasion' in the Constitution is not limited to hostile foreign states, and can include ‘hostile non-state actors.’ Drugs and criminals are pouring across our border and it requires a response,"" he tweeted.

Cuccinelli told Fox News Digital this week that the move was significant and would put pressure on Abbott to take similar action.

""The key here is you've got the first legal ruling that the southern border situation is an invasion,"" he said. "" One, that's obviously very significant, and two it's going to -- as it should -- put enormous pressure on Governor Abbott to adopt that position themselves and to respond accordingly.""

In a statement to Fox News Digital, Abbott press secretary Renae Eze said ""All strategies remain on the table as Texas continues stepping up in the federal government’s absence.""

Eze noted the slew of moves made by Abbott in response to the crisis, including under Operation Lone Star -- which has surged resources to the Texas border.

""While President Biden ignores the ever-growing humanitarian crisis, and Congressional members visit the border for photo-ops and then return to Washington to do nothing, Texas has deployed thousands of Texas National Guard soldiers and DPS troopers and spent over $4 billion of Texas taxpayer money to secure our border, including building our own border wall, erecting strategic barriers, and sending significant resources to help our local partners as was mentioned repeatedly in the Brackettville press conference, Eze said.

She said the operations have resulted in over 274,000 migrant apprehensions, nearly 17,000 criminal arrests, 22,000 turnbacks and the seizure of millions of doses of fentanyl.

""It’s past time for President Biden—and for both parties in Congress—to do their jobs and secure our southern border,"" she said. ""As the challenges on the border continue to increase, Texas will continue to take additional unprecedented action to address those challenges caused by the Biden administration.""

National security adviser Sullivan describes what Russian invasion of Ukraine would 'likely' look like,"National security adviser Jake Sullivan on Sunday said that he cannot know for sure what will happen in Ukraine, but described how a potential Russian invasion would play out if it were to happen.

""If there is a military invasion of Ukraine by Russia, it's likely to begin with a significant barrage of missiles and bomb attacks,"" Sullivan said. ""Those are never as precise as any army would like them to be, and we don't even know how precise the Russian army would like them to be, so innocent civilians could be killed regardless of their nationality.""

PENTAGON SPOX SAYS THREAT OF RUSSIA SANCTIONS HAS 'DETERRENT EFFECT', BUT ADMITS INVASION MAY BE 'DAYS AWAY'

During an interview on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" Sullivan continued by predicting there would be an ""onslaught of a ground force moving across the Ukrainian frontier"" following the bomb attacks if they occur, adding that civilians could get caught in the crossfire if this invasion takes place.

""We will defend NATO's territory,"" Sullivan said. ""We will impose costs on Russia and we will ensure that we emerge from this as the West stronger, more determined, more purposeful than we have been in 30 years, and that Russia ultimately suffers a significant strategic cost for military action.""

Sullivan said the Biden administration could not ""perfectly predict"" which day Russia would invade Ukraine, but said it could begin ""any day now,"" stating that the way Russia has ""built up their forces"" and ""the way they have maneuvered things in place makes it a distinct possibility that there will be major military action very soon.""

Sullivan also reiterated a warning from the Biden administration to American citizens in Ukraine, telling them to leave Ukraine ""immediately"" and that there will not be a military evacuation. The State Department on Saturday said Americans should escape through Poland.

Earlier this morning, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told ""Fox News Sunday"" that intelligence shows that Russia could stage an invasion ""any day now,"" if not sooner. He also said the U.S. will not impose sanctions against Russia before any potential invasion of Ukraine, adding that threatening sanctions has a ""deterrent effect"" that would be lost once sanctions are issued.

Multiple Texas counties to declare border crisis an ‘invasion’ as numbers increase,"Multiple Texas counties on Tuesday will declare that the migrant crisis at the southern border is an ""invasion,"" Fox News has learned, a move that could lead to similar declarations across the state.

Kinney County Judge Tully Shahan is expected to announce the move at a news conference Tuesday afternoon, along with a number of other officials from other counties who will join him.

Kinney County Attorney Brent Smith told Fox News Digital that he believes approximately 12 to15 counties could end up having declared an invasion by the end of the month.

With migrant numbers hitting historic levels, and with more than 239,000 migrant encounters in May alone, there has been considerable talk in conservative circles about the merits of declaring the crisis an ""invasion"" -- which could open up a number of potential legal avenues for states.

ARIZONA AG BRNOVICH ISSUES LEGAL OPINION DECLARING BORDER CRISIS ‘INVASION’ UNDER CONSTITUTION

Former Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Russ Vought and former acting deputy DHS Secretary Ken Cuccinelli, both now at the Center for Renewing America have urged governors to make the declarations and use war powers to order Arizona’s police or National Guard to remove illegal immigrants to Mexico themselves.

They have pointed to language in Article I of the Constitution, which allows for States to ""engage in War"" when it has been ""actually invaded, or in such imminent Danger as will not admit of delay"" without the approval of Congress. They also note Article IV says the U.S. ""shall protect each [state] against invasion.""

The idea scored a major win in February, when Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich issued a legal opinion declaring the crisis an invasion, arguing that the definition of ""invasion"" contained under the U.S. Constitution is not limited to hostile foreign states, and can include ""hostile non-state actors.""

REPUBLICANS, HAWKS FEAR BORDER CRISIS WILL GET WORSE AFTER SCOTUS ‘REMAIN-IN-MEXICO’ RULING

""The violence and lawlessness at the border caused by transnational cartels and gangs satisfies the definition of an ‘invasion’ under the U.S. Constitution, and Arizona therefore has the power to defend itself from this invasion under the Governor’s authority as Commander-in-Chief,"" Brnovich wrote. ""An actual invasion permits the State to engage in defensive actions within its own territory at or near its border.""

Cuccinelli told Fox News Digital that the move by the Texas counties was significant and should now put more pressure on Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to make the declaration himself.

""The key here is you've got the first legal ruling that the southern border situation is an invasion,"" he said. "" One, that's obviously very significant, and two it's going to -- as it should -- put enormous pressure on Governor Abbott to adopt that position themselves and to respond accordingly.""

Kinney County itself is a rural county and officials there have estimated that they have seen thousands of illegal immigrants crossing through the county in recent weeks.

""NATO’s core task is to protect and defend all allies. There must be no room for miscalculation or misunderstanding,"" Stoltenberg said.

"One year after Russian invasion, Condoleezza Rice warns against saying 'time is on the Ukrainian side'","Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice on Sunday warned that one year after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. and its allies need to get away from the phrase ""time is on the Ukrainian side"" because Russian President Vladimir Putin appears to believe otherwise.

Rice, who served under former President George W. Bush, made the remarks on CBS’s ""Face the Nation"" while speaking about how the Biden administration ""sometimes seem[ed] to be a little bit behind"" in providing Ukrainian troops with the necessary training and equipment to continue fending off Russia.

""But to the degree that [training and equipment] can be accelerated, I think it will help because I think we have to get away from the phrase time is on the Ukrainian side. I would be careful about that,"" Rice said.

""Vladimir Putin seems to believe that time is not on the Ukrainian side,"" she continued. ""He believes if he throws in the Russian way of war, mass at the problem, poor boys from Dagestan who are just kind of cannon fodder, if he engages in terrorist activities against the Ukrainian population, he'll wear the Ukrainians down, he’ll wear us down, he’ll wear the Europeans down. I don't think that's right. But we have to do everything that we can to convince him that it is indeed wrong.""

""It's our assessment that they have every intention of basically decapitating the government,"" the official said, specifying that ""they're making a move on Kyiv.""

Russia planning Ukraine false flag as pretext for invasion: Pentagon,"The United States has intelligence that Russia is likely to ""fabricate"" a pretext for an invasion of Ukraine, the Pentagon confirmed Thursday.

The Washington Post on Thursday morning first reported that Russia has developed a plan to create a pretext for a Ukraine invasion by falsely pinning an attack on Ukrainian forces.

WHITE HOUSE BACKS AWAY FROM CALLING RUSSIAN UKRAINE INVASION ‘IMMINENT’

""We do have information that the Russians are likely to want to fabricate a pretext for an invasion, which, again, is right out of their playbook,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said when asked whether the report was accurate.

U.S. officials believe that Russia is planning to ""stage a fake attack by Ukrainian military or intelligence forces against Russian sovereign territory or against Russian-speaking people to therefore justify their action as part of this fake attack,"" Kirby explained.

""We believe that Russia would produce a very graphic propaganda video, which would include corpses and actors that would be depicting mourners, and images of destroyed locations, as well as military equipment, at the hands of Ukraine, or the West,"" Kirby said, adding that the U.S. has information that the equipment in the video ""would be made to look like it was Western supplied"" equipment to Ukraine.

""This is just one example,"" Kirby said. ""We’re watching this across the board. We’ve seen these kinds of activity by the Russians in the past.""

The Washington Post reported that the plan was approved by the highest levels of the Russian government.

When asked how Pentagon officials knew that to be the case, Kirby said ""our experience is that very little of this nature is not approved at the highest levels of the Russian government,"" referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Kirby’s comments come just a day after the U.S. announced it will deploy 3,000 more troops to Romania, Poland and Germany.

US TO MOVE MORE TROOPS TO NATO'S EASTERN FLANK AMID RUSSIA-UKRAINE SITUATION

Last week, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin put 8,500 U.S. troops on heightened preparedness, as President Biden and his national security officials weighed where to send troops in Eastern Europe to aid Ukraine as part of a broader NATO effort, while Putin threatened incursion.

The 3,000 troops include 2,000 from 82nd Airborne Division and 18th Airborne Corps, based in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and 1,000 who are currently based in Germany. The troops from Germany will deploy to Romania, the 82 Airborne soldiers will go to Poland, and the 18th Airborne forces will go to Germany.

The Pentagon, on Wednesday, said the forces ""are not going to fight in Ukraine,"" but instead would ""ensure a robust defense of our NATO allies.""

There are already approximately 900 U.S. troops in Romania.

The 8,500 troops that Austin put on heightened standby, though, ""are not currently being deployed, but remain ready to move if called for the NATO response force or as needed for other contingencies as directed by the secretary or by President Biden,"" Kirby said Wednesday.

Last week, top Pentagon officials said the build-up of Russian troops along Ukraine's border is the largest since the Cold War, and warned that conflict in Eastern Europe would be ""horrific,"" but stressed that it is ""not inevitable,"" maintaining that there is ""still time and space for diplomacy,"" as the Kremlin continues to threaten further incursion in Ukraine.

Meanwhile, the White House, on Wednesday, backed away from its characterization that Russia’s invasion into Ukraine is ""imminent,"" saying officials ""still don’t know"" if Putin has ""made a decision"" on incursion.

President Biden last week, during a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, warned of a ""distinct possibility"" of a Russian invasion in February.

BIDEN WARNS RUSSIA OF 'SWIFT AND SEVERE CONSEQUENCES' IF THEY 'WALK AWAY' FROM DIPLOMACY AND ATTACK UKRAINE

Zelenskyy, though, said Ukraine is ""not seeing any escalation bigger than before,"" and said the Russian build-up of troops could be an attempt by Moscow to exert ""psychological pressure"" and sow panic.

And Russia has denied it intends to launch an attack. Russian officials said NATO must promise not to allow Ukraine to join the alliance, among other demands, which the United States and NATO have rejected.

Russia Ambassador Vasily Nebenzya on Monday slammed the West, claiming it is trying to will a Ukrainian war into existence.

"Russia preparing false-flag operation as pretext for Ukraine invasion, US warns","The United States is concerned that the Russian government is preparing for an invasion into Ukraine that may result in widespread human rights violations and war crimes, a U.S. official said Friday.

The official told Fox News that Russia is laying the groundwork to have the option of fabricating a pretext for invasion, including through sabotage activities and information operations, by accusing Ukraine of preparing an imminent attack against Russian forces in Eastern Ukraine.

OPINION: PUTIN IS PICKING A FIGHT HE CAN'T WIN WITH UKRAINE

The official said that the Russian military plans to begin these activities several weeks before a military invasion, which could begin between mid-January and mid-February. The official said the plans are reminiscent of the Kremlin's playbook in 2014 with the invasion of Crimea.

The Biden administration, according to the official, has information that indicates Russia has already prepositioned a group of operatives to conduct a ""false-flag operation"" in eastern Ukraine. The official warned that the operatives are trained in urban warfare, and in using explosives to carry out acts of sabotage against Russia's own proxy forces.

The official explained that the administration's information also indicates that Russian influence actors are already beginning to fabricate Ukrainian provocations in state and social media to justify a Russian intervention and sow divisions in Ukraine.

One example, the official said, is Russian officials and influence actors emphasizing narratives about ""the deterioration of human rights in Ukraine and the increased militancy of Ukrainian leaders.""

NATO, RUSSIA SUMMIT WRAPS UP: ‘NOT AN EASY DISCUSSION,’ SAYS NATO CHIEF

""These media narratives also blame the West for escalating tension, highlight humanitarian issues in Ukraine that Russian intervention could solve, and promote Russian patriotism to encourage domestic support for military action,"" the official said.

Last month, the official said that Russian language content on social media covering ""all three of these narratives"" increased to an average of nearly 3,500 posts per day – a 200% increase from the daily average in November.

This, after the Biden administration this week maintained that it is ""working in lockstep"" with its allies to ""urge de-escalation and respond to the security crisis caused by Russia.""

"Russia 'preparing for invasion of Ukraine,' NATO head says, as world faces 'new normal in European security'","NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Sunday said of the current build-up of troops at the Ukrainian border that it appeared ""Russia is preparing for an invasion of Ukraine"" and stressed that while it is not too late for Moscow to change course against an armed attack, there is a ""new normal in European security.""

Stoltenberg's remarks come as President Biden has called an urgent meeting of his National Security Council Sunday.

""Last week, actually, Russia said that they will step back. Russia is stepping up with more troops and higher and even closer to the Ukrainian border,"" Stoltenberg, speaking from Brussels, told CBS’ ""Face The Nation"" host Margaret Brennan. ""Also, the fact that this exercise, they said, should end today will now continue. So, all of this fits into the picture that Russia is preparing for an invasion of Ukraine.""

Russian President Vladimir Putin personally oversaw some strategic nuclear exercises Saturday, something Stoltenberg saw as a way for Moscow to demonstrate their capabilities.

Though it was a ""regular exercise,"" it was planned for last fall but instead took place ""in the midst of this significant Russian military build-up in and around Ukraine with the largest concentration of combat troops I've seen in Europe since the end of the Cold War,"" Stoltenberg said.

Stoltenberg asserted there ""has been a crisis in the making for a long time,"" as NATO has been working to gradually increase its presence in the eastern flank since Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. With Russia and Belarus stating its troops will remain in the north of Ukraine, Stoltenberg said NATO has made additional reinforcements in recent weeks and months.

""I think what we are now faced with is a new normal in European security. We see Russia being willing to contest fundamental values for our security by the use of force and also by the threat of use of force,"" Stoltenberg said. ""We have reinforced and implemented the biggest reinforcement of collective defense since the end of the Cold War, with battlegroups in the Baltic region, in Poland, with increased defense spending every year since 2014 and with a higher readiness of the NATO forces.""

He also acknowledged the potential of a refugee crisis if Russia does invade Ukraine.

""The most important thing is to prevent a new armed attack on Ukraine, and therefore we support all efforts by NATO allies to find a political solution, and NATO's also ready to sit down in the NATO-Russia Council with Russia. If Russia decides to use force, that may, of course, be a large number of people fleeing Ukraine,"" Stoltenberg said, adding that the NATO Response Force will be prepared to deploy to offer assistance in neighboring countries like Poland and Romania.

Speaking at the Munich Security Conference in Germany Saturday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on his country’s allies to do more, arguing that Ukraine is being treated as a buffer state between the West and Russia. When pressed by Brennan Sunday about the issue, Stoltenberg said NATO does not have a set date for when Ukraine might become a member of the bloc.

""We have not set any timeline for that,"" Stoltenberg said. ""NATO allies have been very clear that it is for Ukraine and 30 NATO allies to decide on membership and not Russia. And second, we have provided over many years significant support to Ukraine.""

""We help them to modernize the defense and security institutions to strengthen their cyber defenses,"" he continued. ""NATO allies, the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and others have also provided significant training and different kinds of military equipment, defensive weapons. So, the Ukrainian Armed Forces are much stronger now with better equipped, better trained troops than in 2014.

Russia invasion of Ukraine marks latest in Putin's history of misdeeds at home and abroad,"Russian President Vladimir Putin's incursion into Ukraine is the latest instance of destabilizing or oppressive behavior at home and abroad by the authoritarian strongman -- who has managed to shrug off pushback and denunciations from foes in his more than 20 years in power.

Putin announced Monday that he was recognizing the independence of two regions in Eastern Ukraine, a move followed up by troop deployments that the White House declared to be the beginning of the anticipated invasion of the country by Russia.

The move led to sanctions from the U.S. and its allies in Europe, as well as outrage and fears of a war of the kind Europe has not seen on its soil since the 1940s. British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace described Putin as having ""gone full tonto"" on Wednesday.

RUSSIA INVADED UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES

President Biden was similarly outraged: ""Who in the Lord's name does Putin think gives him the right to declare new so-called countries on territory that belonged to his neighbors?""

But the aggressive behavior is in line with the Russian leader’s previous misdeeds during his time in power, which have long been recognized by hawks in the U.S. The late Sen. John McCain once declared Putin a ""thug and a murderer and a killer and a KGB agent.""

Incursions into disputed territory

The incursion into Ukraine is not Putin’s first move into disputed territory, with a number of aggressive incidents in the last two years -- even as those moves threaten European stability and that Putin himself appeared to explain his motivation for some years ago.

""At the 2007 Munich Security Conference, Putin asserted that he did not support NATO enlargement and that Western values are not their values,"" Ambassador Paula Dobriansky, a former Under Secretary of State for Global Affairs and now a senior fellow at Harvard University’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, told Fox News Digital. ""He also stated that he would come to the defense of Russians living anywhere, whose rights were in jeopardy.""

A year later, in 2008, Russia invaded Georgia on a similar pretext to this week’s incursion -- support of separatist governments in a territory beyond its own borders. International condemnations did not appear to shift Putin’s thinking on the matter and Russia suffered few international consequences as a result. A cease-fire was ultimately negotiated that was widely seen as benefiting Moscow.

ARE RUSSIANS ON BOARD WITH PUTIN?

Then in 2014, Putin seized the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine after the country’s pro-Russian government was toppled by mass protests and replaced by a more pro-E.U. administration. Putin and the Russian government had long made claims that the peninsula was rightfully Russian, and moved in to secure the area. A disputed independence referendum soon followed.

The latter invasion was widely seen as the nail in the coffin for the ""Russian reset"" -- a policy by the Obama administration to reset hostile relations with Moscow, and that famously saw then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton present Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov with a plastic red button. Outside of Europe, Putin’s Russia would later go on to put boots on the ground in Syria to preserve its access and interests there as well.

Dobriansky said that the move into Eastern Ukraine this week is part of that broader aggression, and noted that it violates international agreements including the 1994 Budapest Memorandum – which included provisions that Ukraine would surrender its nuclear weapons, but would also guarantee Ukraine's territorial integrity.

""Putin's recognition of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent states is a clear act of aggression and violates the sanctity of various international laws, including the Helsinki treaty and the Budapest Memorandum. Putin's goal has been to challenge and diminish American power and influence worldwide and to fragment our alliances and partnerships.""

Silencing dissent at home

While citizens in Western countries largely take freedom of speech and open criticism of their government leaders for granted, in Putin’s Russia that is not the case.

Putin’s regime has a long history of suppressing protests and keeping restrictions on journalistic freedom -- particularly those who oppose the Russian government. NBC News reported in October that Moscow has been cranking up its repression by using laws passed in 2012 to regulate the activities of foreign agents.

Meanwhile, opposition leader Alexei Navalny was jailed last year and is currently on trial for fraud -- after he returned to Russia after months of treatment for a near-fatal poison attack that he has blamed on Moscow. Putin’s government subsequently banned any political organization linked to Navalny by branding them ""extremist.""

Anti-regime protests have for years been met by extreme force by Russian police, with arrest powers used broadly. One prominent case was the response to the ""Pussy Riot"" protests in 2013, which humanitarian groups noted were followed by the imprisonment of the Pussy Riot band members, and laws that brought hefty fines for public protests.

Attacks on opponents abroad

Putin’s suppression of opposition has not just been limited to those within Russia. In addition to Navalny’s claim that his poisoning abroad was due to Moscow’s command, there have been other incidents of dissidents being attacked even when outside of Russia.

In 2006, Alexander Litvinenko, an ex-Russian intelligence officer who defected, was poisoned in London. He died weeks later after drinking tea laced with polonium-210. Authorities blamed the poisoning on Russian intelligence agents acting on order from the Kremlin.

In 2018, the Russian government poisoned Sergei Skripal, a former Russian military officer and double agent who had been jailed by Russia but released as part of a spy swap, and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury, England. While both targets survived, a British woman who encountered the poison after it had been disposed subsequently died. While the Kremlin denied responsibility, the incident provoked a diplomatic crisis in Europe.

Interference in other countries' elections

U.S. intelligence organizations have accused Putin of meddling in U.S. election, specifically the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections, aiming to hurt the Democrats running in both those races and to aid former President Donald Trump.

""We assess with high confidence that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election, the consistent goals of which were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump,"" a declassified intelligence report said in 2017.

While the extent and impact of that interference have been debated and downplayed by some, including Trump, officials accused Putin of efforts including spreading disinformation on social media and efforts to influence people close to Trump, as well as cyber operations against both the Republican and Democratic parties and the release of hacked data to the public.

In Europe too, top officials have accused Russia of using its influence to sway elections across the continent using a variety of strategies, including denigrating politicians and spreading misinformation to voters.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/russia-ukraine-crisis-aggression-putin-misdeeds,N/A
Russian invasion: How the west failed over decades of recent history to hold Putin back,"Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine comes after decades of United States foreign policy failing to curb his military aggressions, which experts tell Fox News emboldened Putin over the years leading up to the invasion of Ukraine.

""Putin feels pretty emboldened,"" Retired CIA Senior Clandestine Services Officer Dan Hoffman told Fox News Digital on Saturday. ""He won wars in Chechnya, Georgia, Ukraine and Syria. That's four big ones.""

Over the course of those four wars, the United States leveled various sanctions against Russia that failed to deter the country from future aggressions, which Hoffman explained is further proof, in addition to the recent sanctions from the Biden administration that failed to stop Putin’s invasion in Ukraine, that sanctions are ineffective against Russia.

""I’ve said that all along,"" Hoffman said when asked about the perception that sanctions are not enough to deter Putin. ""It’s an easy thing that makes you feel good but it does nothing to influence Vladimir Putin’s calculus. He doesn't care.""

""Absent concurrent diplomacy and expeditious use of our military tools, sanctions don’t do it,"" Hoffman added.

Putin’s aggressive actions against European neighbors as the leader of Russia traces back to the 2000s when Russia launched a devastating cyberattack against the neighboring NATO nation of Estonia and sent troops into Chechnya.

""I have been arguing for a long time that the more Western members of NATO did not take the experiences of the newer Eastern members as seriously as they should have,"" former Estonian President Toomas Hendrik Ilves, who was in power during the cyberattack in 2007, recently said . ""And now, 15 years later, they have to face up to the consequences of not really believing what the Eastern members were saying.""

UKRAINE-RUSSIA WAR: RUSSIAN TROOPS UNDERFUNDED, EQUIPMENT SUB-PAR, ACCORDING TO REPORTS

In 2008, Russia sent troops into the former Soviet republic of Georgia along the Black Sea in a move that Russia called a ""peace enforcement operation"" similar to the description Putin used of his invasion into Ukraine this month which he called a ""peacekeeping operation.""

""No one was willing to go to war for Georgia,"" Mark Galeotti, senior non-resident fellow at the Institute of International Relations Prague and an expert on modern Russian history, said about the conflict to History.com in 2018. ""This was a time in which no one really wanted to provoke Russia. [Dmitry] Medvedev was president, and particularly American policy was to essentially hope that this could be leveraged into something more positive. So…to a large extent, Georgia was left on its own.""

In 2014, during the Obama administration, Russia invaded and annexed the Crimea region of Ukraine as well as the Donbas region of the country and were slapped with mild sanctions on Putin and his associates by the United States.

BIDEN WARNS 'THERE'S NO SANCTION THAT IS IMMEDIATE' AS US, ALLIES TARGET RUSSIA OVER UKRAINE INVASION

""In hindsight, one wonders, would Crimea and the Donbass wars have happened if the West had been more robust in its response to Georgia?"" Galeotti said.

Putin also flexed his military power during the Trump administration sending troops into Syria to support President Bashar al-Assad’s efforts to combat ISIS and quell a civil war that significantly increased tensions with the United States and also led to sanctions against various Russian entities.

So far in 2022, sanctions levied by the Biden administration and Russia have failed to deter Putin from continuing his military advance into the Ukranian capital of Kyiv.

""The Biden administration said we’re not going to sanction them preemptively because we won’t have anything to do if he invades,"" Hoffman said. ""In other words, they were saying he won’t invade because he knows he’s going to get sanctioned and we’re going to assist the Ukrainians with all types of military equipment which is what we’re doing. We’re sanctioning Russia and providing military assistance to Ukraine. So clearly that didn’t deter Vladimir Putin. So that was an ignorant policy and we’re paying a price for that.""

Rebekah Koffler, former Defense Intelligence Agency officer and the author of ""Putin’s Playbook: Russia’s Secret Plan to Defeat America"", told Fox News Digital that Putin has been successful at outsmarting the United States dating back to his first days in office roughly 20 years ago.

""It's not so much that we acquiesced, although we did a couple of times, it’s that we were fooled,"" Koffler said. ""Putin kept fooling our leadership.""

HOFFMAN AND SOAMES: STOP PUTIN NOW, AS CHURCHILL WOULD WARN, OR WEST WILL FACE THE CONSEQUENCES

Koffler explained that Putin used his training from the KGB to disarm and deceive U.S. presidents including in the 2000s where she says he ""put a whole act on"" with former President George W. Bush by insisting he was a man of deep Christian religious conviction.

In terms of the United States acquiescing to Russia, Koffler outlined multiple ways that the Obama administration deferred to Russian influence including the highly criticized viral moment where Obama could be overheard telling Russian President Dmitry Medvedev he would have ""more flexibility"" on missile defense negotiations after his next upcoming election.

The Obama administration was also criticized for not pursuing stricter action against Syria’s chemical weapons program in an attempt to assuage Russia.

Obama also mocked former presidential candidate Mitt Romney during a debate in 2012 when Romney said that Russia was the biggest geopolitical threat that America faced at the time.

""A few months ago when you were asked what’s the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you said Russia, not al-Qaeda,"" Obama said during the third presidential debate between him and Romney in October 2012.

"Texas county ratifies invasion declaration, as sheriff warns of cartel control of migrant flows","A Texas county this week ratified a declaration that the crisis at the southern border is an ""invasion,"" part of a growing push by some border officials to make a state-wide declaration -- as the county’s sheriff warns of the control that cartels have of the migrant flows.

Goliad County was one of a number of counties who last week declared the crisis an invasion. This week the county’s commissioners court ratified the declaration, which urges Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to make a declaration for the state.

A number of Republican officials and lawmakers at the state and national levels have described the crisis as an invasion -- citing the amount of deadly drugs like fentanyl coming into the U.S., as well as the massive number of migrants.

The officials and lawmakers have argued that declaring an invasion allows the state governments in Arizona, Texas and elsewhere to expand powers and remove illegal immigrants from the country. Gov. Greg Abbott recently used the word ""invasion"" in an executive order authorizing the return of migrants to the border, but it was not an explicit invasion declaration.

HOUSE REPUBLICANS BACK TEXAS COUNTIES' ‘INVASION’ DECLARATION IN RESPONSE TO BORDER CRISIS

Rep. Michael Cloud, R-Texas, who will represent Goliad County if re-elected next year, backed the county’s move with a formal statement of support -- in which he described the Biden administration as ""derelict in their duty to protect and secure our homeland.""

""The Biden administration continues to shrug off Americans' calls for increased border security while criminal cartels exploit and attack our nation,"" Cloud told Fox News Digital in a statement. ""Texas has a right to defend itself, and Goliad has my full support in declaring an invasion.""

Goliad County Sheriff Roy Boyd told Fox News Digital that the situation has become increasingly worse in recent months, and pointed to the ubiquitous presence of cartels and other transnational criminal organizations that are organizing the human and drug smuggling.

""It's organized transnational criminal activity, and it's an invasion just based off of the sheer volume of humanity coming through,"" he said.

""The cartel is pushing an ever-growing number of people through and into our jurisdiction,"" he said. ""And we can't just stand idly by and allow it to happen.""

Boyd stressed not only the impact of the crisis on the community, but also on the migrants themselves -- who he said often discover once they get into the U.S. that they are placed into indentured servitude to buy back their freedom.

""They've entered into an agreement with the cartel to knowingly illegally come into our country, to trespass and then are involved in other crimes along the way. And so then they get to Houston and a cartel tells them, ‘Oh, yes, you owe us another $10,000.’""

He described appalling situations in which migrants are living in one-bedroom apartments packed with 20 people, and are forced onto an eight to 13-year path to buy their freedom back. He accused the U.S. government of encouraging the exploitation and predicted that there would be dire consequences if the situation was allowed to continue.

""Everybody's made in the image of God, and nobody has the right to put somebody into bondage,"" he said. ""But we find ourselves in the situation where…our government is encouraging the importation of a peon class that lives in the shadows.""

""As human beings made in the image of God, our rights don't come from the government. Our rights come from our Lord and Savior,"" he said. ""And so these people at some point will rise up and demand their freedom, and they will demand that they receive the opportunity of the American Dream. And when they do, that very well may be a very violent uprising. And as Americans, as the Bible says, we will reap what we sow and woe to us for what we've allowed to happen in this country -- because it's a sin against God and it is a sin against humanity and we cannot have this going on in our country if we wish to continue to be a free state that falls under the favor of the Lord.""

Texas Gov. Abbott tells Biden he is invoking 'invasion' clause of Constitution because of border 'failures',"Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has sent a letter to the White House to explain the need for more aggressive efforts to curb illegal immigration into the state.

The letter, addressed to President Biden, accuses the administration of willfully ignoring the ongoing mass influx of illegal immigrants into the country's southern states.

""Your inaction has led to catastrophic consequences. Under your watch, America is suffering the highest volume of illegal immigration in the history of our country. This past year, more than 2 million immigrants tried to enter the country illegally, coming from more than 100 countries across the globe,"" Abbott wrote in the Wednesday letter. ""Worse yet, your failed border policies recently prompted a United Nations agency to declare that the border between the United States and Mexico is the deadliest land crossing in the world.""

TEXAS GOV. GREG ABBOTT INVOKES CONSTITUTIONAL 'INVASION CLAUSE' AMID IMMIGRATION CRISIS

Abbott announced Tuesday that he will be invoking an ""invasion"" clause of both the U.S. Constitution and the Texas Constitution to combat ongoing, overwhelming illegal immigration in the state.

The governor noted in his Tuesday announcement a list of intended actions that he claims are covered by the clause, including the activation of National Guard and Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) personnel to safeguard the border and turn back would-be migrants from illegally crossing the border.

TEXAS GOV. ABBOTT AUTHORIZES LAW ENFORCEMENT TO RETURN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS TO BORDER

""You must reinstate the policies that you eliminated, or craft and implement new policies, in order to fulfill your constitutional duty to enforce federal immigration laws and protect the States against invasion,"" Abbott wrote in his Wednesday letter. ""Two years of inaction on your part now leave Texas with no choice but to escalate our efforts to secure our State. Your open-border policies, which have catalyzed an unprecedented crisis of illegal immigration, are the sole cause of Texas having to invoke our constitutional authority to defend ourselves.""

Under Abbott's new initiative, DPS personnel will also be ordered to arrest and return illegal migrants to the border.

""I invoked the Invasion Clauses of the U.S. & Texas Constitutions to fully authorize Texas to take unprecedented measures to defend our state against an invasion,"" Abbott announced via social media Tuesday.

TEXAS GOV. ABBOTT AUTHORIZES LAW ENFORCEMENT TO RETURN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS TO BORDER

""I'm using that constitutional authority, and other authorization and Executive Orders to keep our state and country safe,"" he continued.

The governor included a list of intended actions he claims are covered by the clause, including the activation of National Guard and Texas Department of Public Safety personnel to safeguard the border and turn back would-be migrants from illegally crossing the border.

DPS personnel will also be order to arrest and return illegal migrants to the border.

The governor went on to claim he will be deploying gun boats for defense of the southern border and will designate Mexican drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations.

The ""invasion clause"" referenced by Abbott refers to Article IV, Section 4 of the U.S. Constitution, which states the U.S. ""shall guarantee every state in this Union a republican form of government and shall protect each of them against invasion.""

Texas Rep. Arrington says Biden ‘surrendered control’ of southern border: ‘It is an invasion’,"Texas Rep. Jodey Arrington is backing moves by officials in his state to take matters relating to the migrant crisis into their own hands, claiming President Biden ""surrendered control"" of the border and describing the situation as an invasion.

""They are absolutely doing the right thing, and I commend the governor for following suit,"" the Republican congressman told Fox News Digital in an interview this week.

Arrington spoke after a flurry of moves in Texas related to the border. On Tuesday, multiple counties declared the crisis at the southern border an ""invasion"" and called on Gov. Greg Abbott to do the same, arguing that it would give the state more power to send illegal immigrants to Mexico.

""We want America to know that this is real,"" Kinney County Judge Tully Shahan told reporters. ""The Biden administration won't do a thing about it. They could stop this thing this hour. They could stop it now. They don't have the guts.""

TEXAS GOV. ABBOTT AUTHORIZES LAW ENFORCEMENT TO RETURN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS TO BORDER

Abbott signed an executive order Thursday that allows the Texas National Guard and the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) to apprehend and return illegal immigrants who have crossed between ports of entry to the southern border. Under the order, illegal aliens will be taken to the U.S., but not into Mexico.

Abbott has so far not issued a formal invasion declaration, but his executive order did reference the word ""invasion,"" saying the Biden administration has ""abandoned the covenant, in Article IV, § 4 of the U.S. Constitution, that '[t]he United States … shall protect each [State in this Union] against Invasion …'""

Arrington introduced a resolution last year calling the crisis at the border, which has seen more than 239,000 migrant encounters in May alone, an invasion. And he was supportive of both the actions of the counties and of Abbott. He blamed the crisis on President Biden and his administration, who he said had failed to ""provide for common defense and to repel an invasion.""

""You have a federal government under the leadership of a derelict president who has surrendered control of the border to paramilitary narco-terrorist drug cartels,"" he said. ""And these cartels are very organized, very sophisticated and military capable.""

HOUSE REPUBLICANS BACK TEXAS COUNTIES' ‘INVASION’ DECLARATION IN RESPONSE TO BORDER CRISIS

Arrington noted not only the sheer number of migrants coming across the border, but also the fentanyl crisis, which has contributed to a massive number of drug overdoses in the U.S. Most fentanyl is smuggled in via the U.S. Mexico-land border, and the Drug Enforcement Administration warned earlier this year of a ""nationwide spike"" in fentanyl-related overdoses.

The agency cited Centers for Disease Control and Prevention statistics showing that, during a 12-month period ending in October, there were more than 105,000 drug overdoses, 66% of which were related to fentanyl and other synthetic opioids.

""If you had Al Qaeda or ISIS or some terrorist group that had control of our border and was pushing this poison into our communities and killing our families and our children and our citizens, I guarantee you that people would see this differently,"" Arrington said.

""But it is an invasion, and it is an onslaught, and we are under siege. And there is no other choice for a state leader, a governor, in good conscience, then to declare it as such and begin to enforce the laws of the land and secure the border and protect their citizens. And that that's what I believe is happening with our current governor.""

He called criticism the governor had faced for not going far enough to officially declare an invasion ""premature.""

TEXAS COUNTIES ON THE BORDER AND BEYOND DECLARE ‘INVASION': BIDEN ADMIN DOESN'T ‘HAVE THE GUTS’ TO ACT

""I'm encouraged that he's exercising the powers that are there for states in this circumstance and that the tactics that he mentions also in his executive order that he will deploy seem to be the right ones,"" Arrington said. ""And I'm going to trust that my governor will implement and execute on those in a way that will turn the tide in Texas. And maybe other states will be emboldened by that and follow suit and maybe more scrutiny and pressure will be brought to bear on this president for not having done his most important job.""

Abbott is also facing pressure from the Biden administration, which is investigating the state’s Operation Lone Star, which surged resources and law enforcement to the border as part of an effort to stop illegal immigration into the state.

Arrington said he was not surprised by the efforts of the administration, which he accused of having ""weaponized"" the levers of power ""like no other administration.""

""So I'm not surprised that this administration would abuse its power and harass Gov. Abbott and the state of Texas for standing up for themselves and the defense of their citizens when this administration's own policies have created this constitutional crisis,"" Arrington said.

"Threat of Russia invasion looms, Congress divided on sanction strategy","Top U.S. and NATO officials have warned Russia may plan to invade Ukraine in the coming days, but U.S. lawmakers remain divided on whether the White House strategy to use severe sanctions as a deterrent is working.

""I can't imagine why President Biden will not step forward and take an action,"" Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., told Fox News Saturday. ""It appears that he is waiting for things to escalate for lives to be lost, property to be damaged.""

MOST 'POWERFUL' RUSSIAN SANCTIONS ARE AGAINST ITS BIG BANKS: US' LONGEST-SERVING DIPLOMAT

The senator, who sits on the Armed Services Committee, argued that ""sanctions work.""

""One of the things he could have done was to move in and have Russia removed from the SWIFT international banking system. Hitting those banks would be the appropriate thing to do,"" she argued.

Blackburn’s comments came one day after Deputy National Security Advisor for International Economics, Daleep Singh, told reporters that removing Moscow from the SWIFT banking system was likely not going to be in the ""initial"" sanction package if Russia invades Ukraine.

""We have other severe measures we can take that our allies and partners are ready to take in lockstep with us, and that don’t have the same spillover effects,"" he said. ""But we always will monitor these options, and we’ll revise our judgments as time goes on.""

Removing Russia from the international banking system has been floated for months as the Kremlin has stepped up its aggression toward Kyiv.

SWIFT allows banks worldwide to securely and efficiently communicate with one another, and facilitates the transfer of ""trillions of dollars in cross-border payments,"" according to Radio Free Europe – effectively cutting Russia off from top financial networks.

But not everyone in Congress agreed that hitting Russia with immediate tough sanctioning was the right move.

A bipartisan bill described as the ""mother of all sanctions"" would have slapped immediate sanctions on Russian officials as well as additional penalties should Moscow invade Kyiv.

PELOSI SAYS PUTIN WILL PAY EVEN WITHOUT UKRAINE INVASION: YOU CAN’T ‘BULLY THE WORLD AND TAKE A WALK’

But despite support from both Republicans and Democrats, resistance by the Biden administration to hit Russia preemptively coupled with calls for tougher actions by the GOP left the bill paralyzed in the upper chamber.

Instead, on Thursday the Senate opted to introduce a resolution – which is not legally binding – to show its united front against Russian aggression.

Member of the Senate Foreign Relations and Armed Services committees, Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., told Fox News the move was ""symbolic.""

""The message we’re trying to send right now is that we believe that sanctions absolutely could have at least made him think twice. But we’re past that point,"" he said.

Now they are looking to ""make very clear to Mr. Putin that his cost long-term is going to be damning in terms of his long-term viability.""

Rounds said sanctions will be hard on European allies and the U.S. business community, but said it will be ""devastating to Russia and to Mr. Putin and his friends.""

Pennsylvania Democrat Rep. Matt Cartwright, Member of House Appropriations Committee, backed the White House’s strategy when it comes to holding the threat of sanctions over Putin’s head.

PENTAGON SPOX SAYS THREAT OF RUSSIA SANCTIONS HAS 'DETERRENT EFFECT', BUT ADMITS INVASION MAY BE 'DAYS AWAY'

""It’s clear that President Biden is purposefully vague about what the exact specifics of the sanctions will be,"" Cartwright told Fox News. ""[Putin] wants to return to the evil empire.

""He thinks – like many of his predecessors – like a chess game. You tell him exactly what sanctions you’re going to pose – he’s going to calculate them. He’s going to have time to evaluate whether he can sustain that burden,"" he added.

Cartwright echoed comments made by NATO and U.S. lawmakers who attended the Munich Security Conference Saturday and said Putin’s aggression has only strengthened ties he was hoping to weaken.

He wasn’t ""banking on the fortitude of the Ukrainian people,"" the Pennsylvania Democrat said. ""These people are ready to fight…and they are going to make Russia hurt.""

Cartwright also argued that Putin likely wasn’t expecting the unity that NATO has shown during this crisis given its ""disarray"" over the last several years.

""They stand shoulder to shoulder,"" he said. ""They are lining up on the borders of Ukraine.""

NATO has not only promised severe economic hardship if Putin violates Ukraine’s sovereignty, but has taken steps to protect surrounding NATO nations by deploying thousands of troops to Poland and Romania.

The Pennsylvania Democrat said NATO’s biggest concern is that Putin may not stop with Ukraine if he is looking to reunite the former Soviet Union.

But Cartwright also argued the threat of an inactive Nord Stream 2 pipeline and uncertainties under threat of immense sanctioning may push Putin to realize he may has ""bitten off more than he can chew.""",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/threat-russia-invasion-looms-congress-divided-sanction-strategy,N/A
"Trump declares 'invasion' at border after DHS says 1 percent of Honduras, Guatemala entered US","A day after the acting Homeland Security secretary estimated that more than 1 percent of the populations of Guatemala and Honduras had entered the U.S. since September, President Trump declared an “invasion” at the U.S.-Mexico border.

Meanwhile, his administration expects record numbers of migrants to arrive from Central America in the coming months.

""When you see these caravans starting out with 20,000 people, that's an invasion,” Trump said at his Wednesday evening “Make American Great Again” rally in Panama City, Fla., defending his declaration of a national emergency at the border earlier this year. “No nation can tolerate a massive organized violation of its immigration laws. And no one should run for office without an ironclad pledge to protect and defend America's borders.""

TRUMP DEFENDS NATIONAL EMERGENCY DECLARATION AT MEXICO BORDER, SAYS DEMS 'DON'T MIND CRIME'

The White House recently proposed charging asylum-seekers a fee to process their applications in an effort to crack down on the surge of Central American migrants trying to cross into the U.S.

In a speech Tuesday to the 49th Washington Conference of the Americas, acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan described why most migrants arriving at the U.S. border come from Guatemala, Honduras or El Salvador.

“Guatemala and Honduras have seen over 1 percent of their total population migrate to the U.S. in the first seven months of this fiscal year,” McAleenan said, citing government-funded research completed by Vanderbilt University. He said most migrants come to escape extreme poverty and stay because of a flawed U.S. immigration system.

“One department of Guatemala, Huehuetenango, has seen almost 35,000 of its residents — close to 3 percent of the population — migrate to the U.S. in that time frame,” McAleenan added.

The flawed U.S. immigration system often permits families and unaccompanied minors to live in the United States for months or years as their asylum claims are processed, even though most will never obtain legal status. Central Americans notice family or neighbors leave and successfully make it into the U.S., so they too choose to embark on the journey, the DHS chief explained.

“In March, we had over 103,000 irregular arrivals of undocumented migrants — 90 percent crossing the U.S. border unlawfully and unsafely in the hands of human smugglers. We will see similar numbers in April,” McAleenan continued, explaining that he expects current trends to continue in the upcoming months.

According to the study carried out by Vanderbilt’s Latin American Public Opinion Project in Guatemala earlier this year, 1 in 4 Guatemalans intend to migrate from Guatemala, with 85 percent of them indicating the U.S. as their preferred destination.

“That’s over 4 million Guatemalans who intend to migrate to the United States,” McAleenan said. The DHS head is working with Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, on an immigration bill designed to overhaul the legal immigration system, the Washington Post reported.

The proposed legislation will include “an aggressive and holistic strategy” to work together with Central America officials in order to identify “pushes” that drive migrants out of Central America.

“We want to work closely with all three countries' customs administrations to help increase the efficiency of cross-border trade by reducing supply chain barriers and support exports and job creation,"" McAleenan said Tuesday, according to the Washington Examiner. ""From an infrastructure, technology, automation, and legal perspective, DHS’s Customs and Border Protection is pursuing broad support for the region’s customs administrations to modernize practices in all of these areas.”

"Trump sounds alarm over 'invasion' at southern border, after returning from Texas","President Trump said Friday that the immigration flow along the southern border amounts to an “invasion,” calling the situation “far worse” than people understand after returning from a visit to the front-lines in Texas.

“Humanitarian Crisis at our Southern Border. I just got back and it is a far worse situation than almost anyone would understand, an invasion!” Trump tweeted Friday. “I have been there numerous times –The Democrats, Cryin’ Chuck and Nancy don’t know how bad and dangerous it is for our ENTIRE COUNTRY.""

He went on to say past administrations should have built a steel barrier or wall: ""They never got it done –I will. Without it, our Country cannot be safe. Criminals, Gangs, Human Traffickers, Drugs & so much other big trouble can easily pour in. It can be stopped cold!""

SHUTDOWN FALLOUT INTENSIFIES AS FEDERAL WORKERS MISS FIRST PAYCHECKS

Unclear, however, is how far Trump is willing to go to construct his long-promised border wall. The demand for funding -- refused by congressional Democrats -- triggered a partial government shutdown last month. Since then, hundreds of thousands of federal workers have been furloughed or forced to work without pay.

The pressure on Washington to strike a deal intensified Friday when most workers missed their paychecks for the first time.

Democrats, led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., have vowed to block any sort of funding for the wall, accusing the president of having “manufactured” a crisis at the border.

TRUMP, EN ROUTE TO BORDER, RAMPS UP WARNING HE COULD DECLARE NATIONAL EMERGENCY

""The president of the United States – having failed to get Mexico to pay for his ineffective, unnecessary border wall, and unable to convince the Congress or the American people to foot the bill – has shut down the government,"" Schumer said in a response delivered jointly with Pelosi on Tuesday. ""American democracy doesn’t work that way. We don’t govern by temper tantrum.""

The president has blamed the shutdown on Democrats, and Democrats have blamed the president. Neither side appears willing to budge -- and if the White House and congressional leaders cannot come to an agreement, Trump has vowed to “almost definitely” use his emergency powers to build the wall.

Trump warns 'world war' could be next as Russia continues invasion in Ukraine,"EXCLUSIVE: ORLANDO, Fla. — Former President Trump warned that Russia’s multi-front invasion in Ukraine could lead to ""world war"" and told Fox News Digital that the Biden administration is going to have to ""do a lot more than just sanctions"" to stop Russian President Vladimir Putin.

During an exclusive one-on-one interview with Fox News Digital on the sidelines of the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) on Saturday, the former president said Russia’s war on Ukraine ""never should have happened.""

""It is a horrible thing. It would never have happened under any circumstance, and it is what it is,"" Trump said. ""But there's great bravery being shown, and I think they’re doing one hell of a job—much more so than anybody would have thought possible.""

When asked if he had a message to Putin, the former president said: ""I have no message.""

""I just think it's a shame that this is going on. It's something that should not be going on,"" Trump said.

""Thousands of people, I mean, this can lead to much bigger than this one area,"" Trump warned. ""This could lead to a lot of other countries and can lead to world war.""

Trump said ""you never know how it starts, in a world war.""

""You never think a war is going to come out of it,"" he continued. ""All of a sudden, you end up in a world war.""

He added: ""This is a very dangerous period for our nation, for the country.""

Just before the interview, the United States, Canada and other European allies announced additional sanctions on Russia—specifically ""selected"" Russian banks to be removed from the SWIFT financial system.

Trump, reacting to the sanctions, told Fox News Digital: ""They’re going to have to do more than just sanctions, I suspect.""

""But sanctions are not, you know, Putin—he understands how to avoid sanctions, and he goes through other countries,"" Trump told Fox News Digital. ""He goes to China as an example.""

Trump, though, said the sanctions ""have to be strong, and they have to be swift, OK, to use a word, because that is a very powerful sanction, as you know, SWIFT.""

""And if they’re not, I can’t imagine—it’s just going to be a question of time,"" Trump said. ""It’s a very ugly thing that's taking place. Should have never happened.""

Meanwhile, Trump told Fox News Digital that China has been emboldened by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, in regard to its aspirations to take Taiwan.

""I do. I think that China would do that anyway,"" he said.

But the former president pointed to the ""way"" the Biden administration withdrew U.S. troops and military assets from Afghanistan, calling it a ""surrender.""

""Getting out was a good thing. I had it down to two thousand soldiers,"" Trump said, referring to his decision as commander-in-chief to reduce the footprint of U.S. troops in the region. ""We were going to get out with strength and dignity, but to take the soldiers, the great Army out first— we took our Army and Marines—we took them out first to do that and leave the Americans behind, leave other people behind, leave $85 billion worth of equipment behind.""

""We had 13 young people that were killed, many that were very badly hurt in the bombing and a couple of other things the way they got out,"" Trump said, referring to the Aug. 26, 2021 suicide bombing outside the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul during the withdrawal that took the lives of 13 U.S. service members – including 11 Marines, one Navy sailor and one Army soldier. Eighteen other U.S. service members were wounded. The bombing also left more than 150 civilians dead.

""I really think that was the most embarrassing—one of the lowest points in the history of our country,"" Trump said. ""And President Xi and Putin, they watched that, and I think they probably came up with ideas that they didn't have before seeing it, because it was grossly incompetent.""

Trump was asked if the Russian invasion of Ukraine occurred under his administration, what he would do, but told Fox News Digital that he couldn’t say ""right now.""

""Well, I tell you what, I would do things, but the last thing I want to do is say it right now, because if somebody asks me that is in a position where they can utilize whatever it is I give them,"" Trump said. ""But I certainly wouldn't want to be talking about it on television or to the media too much.""

He added: ""But there are things you can do that would be very powerful.""

Trump said if Biden requested his help, he ""certainly would do that,"" but said the Biden administration is ""stuck in this situation that should not have happened, and we’re going to see how it ends up.""

""It is very sad, but there is a great amount of bravery being shown right now that’s been pretty incredible,"" Trump said.

Trump would not say whether he had spoken with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

""I don’t want to say,"" he said. ""I just don’t want to say.""

Meanwhile, shifting to social media, Trump, who has been banned from Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat and has launched a social media company of his own, TRUTHSocial, was asked for reaction on Putin’s ability to use the platforms as he wages war.

""There's death in Ukraine, and he's able to use the power of very sick people,"" Trump said of Big Tech executives. ""These are very bad people that control it.""

Trump said ""what they are doing is so bad for our country.""

""Legal or not, I'm not sure,"" Trump said. ""And it gets a lot of people, we will tell you that what they've done is terrible, and we're doing TRUTH Social.""

""Truth,"" Trump said. ""It’s about the truth and I think it's going to be very big, and if you look at it now, how well it's doing—people are amazed—it’s trending like, number one all over the place, and it's going to be great, and we need it.""

Trump said the platform will give ""a voice,"" saying it is needed.

""Because these people, there's something wrong with them,"" Trump said. ""They’re almost, perhaps, they’re sick. Perhaps they're deranged.""

Trump criticized social media companies for allowing ""stone-cold murderers and thugs and dictators at a very dangerous level"" on their platforms, but ""the President of the United States and other people are not allowed to be on.""

""We continue to believe, based on what we've observed, that this resistance is greater than what the Russians expected,"" the official added.

Russian forces have entered Ukraine from the north, south and east, and defense officials believe Putin is attempting to encircle the capital city of Kyiv.

Russia launched a successful amphibious assault from the Sea of Azov Friday and its forces continue to make advancements, but the defense official said Russia has been unable to gain air superiority or take control over any Ukrainian cities.

Despite attempted advances, Russian forces have been unable to successfully penetrate Kyiv and remain approximately 20 miles outside the city.

Overnight clashes that did occur in Kyiv are believed to have been carried out by small numbers of pre-positioned Russian sabotage groups.

Intermittent internet outages persist in Ukraine and civilian housing has been hit largely by Russian shelling and explosives.

Russian troops are ""bypassing"" areas with large populations and are instead leaving forces behind to ""encircle and isolate them,"" the U.K. defense ministry said.

Defense officials estimate that of the 150,000 troops Russia amassed along Ukraine in the months leading up to the incursion that more than 50% of those forces have already entered Ukraine.

President Biden approved the distribution of another $350 million in military aid to Ukraine to help its continued fight against the Russian incursion – pushing U.S. defensive aid for Kyiv over the last year to $1 billion.

"Ukraine invasion: Russian troops stalled north of Kyiv, running out of gas and food: US official","Russian forces' movement towards the Ukrainian capital city of Kyiv is currently ""stalled,"" a senior U.S. defense official said Tuesday morning, citing a variety of factors, including a lack of food for Russian troops.

With Russia having committed now more than 80% of their assembled combat power, they have made little substantial movement toward Kyiv in the past 24 hours, the official said.

""It doesn’t appear to be making a lot of progress,"" the official said, discussing the movement on the capital.

The official said in explaining the Russian's lack of progress, while ""some of it has to do with their own sustainment and logistics,"" some of it is also due to the Ukrainian resistance.

The official said that the U.S. has observed that there are ""some morale problems"" in some parts of the Russian military, as they face not just fuel and food problems, but greater resistance than anticipated.

A significant number of Russian troops in Ukraine are conscripts, typically young men without much training or knowledge when it comes to combat operations. The official could not confirm reports that any Russian troops have defected, or that any have intentionally run out of gas.

The official noted that Russia's current lack of progress may not be only due to problems arising from resistance or their own logistics, and they are ""possibly regrouping, rethinking, reevaluating"" before carrying on again.

Discussing weapons capabilities, the official could not confirm reports that Russia was utilizing cluster munitions, although the U.S. had seen video footage meant to support such a claim. What the official did say was that Russia has ""launcher systems that could be used for a thermobaric weapon,"" although they could not confirm the use or presence of such a weapon.

More than 80% of the pre-staged Russian combat power is now inside Ukraine, up from less than 75% on Monday, the official said.

White House declares Russian invasion in Ukraine,"The White House is now calling Russian action in Ukraine an ""invasion,"" saying the ""swift and severe"" sanctions promised by the U.S. are on the way, Fox News has learned.

Russian troops arrived in eastern Ukraine hours after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that he would recognize the independence of two separatist regions, officials said.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE: WHITE HOUSE DECLARES RUSSIAN 'INVASION', SAYS SANCTIONS COMING: LIVE UPDATES

Russian troops entered in Donbas, the name for the area where the two separatist regions, that have long fought Russia-backed rebels, Donetsk and Luhansk, are located, officials said, noting that they ""consider Donbas part of Ukraine.""

The Kremlin then raised the stakes further Tuesday, by saying that recognition extends even to parts held by Ukrainian forces.

A White House official told Fox News that administration officials are calling it an invasion.

""The invasion has begun,"" the official said. ""So our sanctions response has begun.""

RUSSIAN TROOPS MOVED INTO EASTERN UKRAINE'S BREAKAWAY REGIONS, EUROPEAN OFFICIALS SAY

Deputy National Security Adviser Jon Finer, during an interview on CNN Tuesday morning, was pressed on whether Russia’s latest activities would be considered an invasion.

""We think this is, yes, the beginning of an invasion, Russia’s latest invasion into Ukraine, and you're already seeing the beginning of our response that we have said will be swift and severe,"" Finer said.

When pressed again, Finer said: ""I hear an invasion as an invasion and that is what is underway.""

But Finer noted that Russia has been ""invading Ukraine since 2014"" and have been occupying a ""large piece"" of Ukraine since then as well.

""Although they have denied it, Russian troop presence in exactly the two—what they call republics, but they’re really provinces of a sovereign Ukraine—that they recognized yesterday,"" Finer said, referring to Putin’s recognition of the independence of Donetsk and Luhansk.

""So, Russia is essentially making overt what it has denied for some time, which is Russian troop presence in these places, and we’re taking steps in response to that,"" Finer said.

Pressed further, Finer again called the activities an invasion.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE: GERMANY STOPPING NORD STREAM 2 PIPELINE APPROVAL

""I mean, again, I guess for the third or fourth time, I am calling it an invasion,"" he said. ""We are taking a severe response, including sanctions on Russia that will be rolling out in a matter of hours.""

As for sanctions, Finer told CNN that the public is ""already seeing the beginning of our response that we have said will be swift and severe.""

Finer pointed to President Biden’s executive order on Monday, which he said effectively blocked ""all economic activity"" in Donetsk and Luhansk.

Finer said administration officials later Tuesday would announce ""additional sanction steps"" that they plan to take ""that go directly at Russia"" in response to ""the egregious step that they took yesterday away from diplomacy and down the further path toward war.""

White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Tuesday morning said President Biden has ""made clear that if Russia invaded Ukraine, we would act with Germany to ensure Nord Stream 2 does not move forward.""

Germany overnight said it is taking steps to halt the process of certifying the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia over Moscow’s latest actions in eastern Ukraine.

""We have been in close consultations with Germany overnight and welcome their announcement,"" Psaki added. ""We will be following up with our own measures today.""

The 764-mile pipeline that would carry natural gas from Russia to Germany has not begun operating. Nord Stream 2 is owned and operated by a wholly owned subsidiary of Russia state company Gazprom.

Earlier this month, Biden promised to ""bring an end"" to Nord Stream 2 if Russia invaded Ukraine. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, appearing with Biden on his first official visit to Washington, was far less explicit about stopping Nord Stream 2, but said that the U.S. and Germany would have the same approach on punishing Russia financially.

The Nord Stream 2 has seen a faster development and deployment despite sanctions placed on it by the Trump administration. With those sanctions removed, Germany remains keen to see the pipeline activated sooner rather than later.

Scholz had insisted that the pipeline is a ""business project,"" according to German outlet DW.

Biden last year removed sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, allowing construction and activation to proceed.

The plan to allow Russia to develop the pipeline to create leverage in times of political crisis may have backfired, as Germany has also rapidly grown dependent on the completion and activation of the pipeline.

Ovechkin, a known supporter of Russian President Vladimir Putin, was instantly placed in the spotlight last week after news of Russia’s invasion into Ukraine broke early Thursday morning.

""He's been the face of our franchise and the face of hockey in this area, his family has grown up here, his kids are from here, and because of his status, he's put in a hard situation to probably handle — a situation that I'm not sure that he's fully thought out or that anybody has, really. It's hard for him.""

Ovechkin, who was previously made unavailable for reporters ahead of last week’s game against the New York Rangers , spoke to reporters after Friday’s team practice, saying he hopes the conflict in Ukraine will ""end soon"" but seemingly avoided distancing himself from Putin.

For now, MacLellan says all he can do is offer his support.

Ansley Pacheco, 26, was in the bathroom when two men broke in, and forced her family and friends to the floor at gunpoint, according to Miami's WPLG-TV.

Home surveillance video shows the suspects surprising a friend of Pacheco’s in the driveway before pushing him inside, where a group was watching the game.

The suspects made everyone in the living room get on the floor.

But another camera shows Pacheco in a bedroom. She grabs an object from a nightstand and can be heard yelling at the suspects.

“I just knew that I had to do something, and my first instinct was to grab the gun and defend my husband and my son,” she told WPLG.

In the video, she shouts, “Don’t shoot me, my son is in here,” then gunshots ring out.

Pacheco told Miami FOX affiliate WSVN-TV that the suspects opened fire.

After an exchange, the suspects reportedly fled, and Pacheco’s husband, identified by WSVN as Daniel Pacheco, took the gun from her.

An exterior camera captured him chasing the suspects down the driveway before they sped off as more shots were fired. They reportedly stole watches and jewelry.

Miami-Dade police confirmed they responded to an armed home invasion robbery the night of Oct. 4 on 86th Avenue.

Pacheco told local outlets that she did not know the suspects, and they remain at large. Miami-Dade Crime Stoppers is offering a potential $1,000 reward in the case.

Gen. Milley says Kyiv could fall within 72 hours if Russia decides to invade Ukraine: sources,"Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley told lawmakers that Kyiv could fall within 72 hours if a full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine takes place, multiple congressional sources tell Fox News.

Milley told lawmakers during closed-door briefings on Feb. 2 and 3 that a full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine could result in the fall of Kyiv within 72-hours, and could come at a cost of 15,000 Ukrainian troop deaths and 4,000 Russian troop deaths.

Several lawmakers expressed concern that the Biden administration did not respond quickly to provide Ukraine with significant military aid, such as anti-aircraft and rocket launcher systems that would defend against an invasion from Russia.

Biden administration officials at the meetings responded to these concerns by saying that a significant supply of military aid to Ukraine could be used as a reason to invade Ukraine.

While Ukraine is receiving security assistance from the United States through a $200 million allocation made in December, it is also receiving $600 million in assistance from the United Kingdom and Baltic states, which the country is depending heavily upon and includes anti-tank Javelin missiles and older-version Stinger portable anti-aircraft missiles.

George W. Bush makes unfortunate Iraq gaffe when condemning Putin's Ukraine invasion,"Former President George W. Bush made an eye-catching gaffe regarding Iraq while condemning Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine.

Bush delivered remarks regarding the importance of democracy and threats to democracy in the U.S. and abroad.

""In contrast, Russian elections are rigged,"" he said. ""Political opponents are imprisoned or otherwise eliminated from participating in the electoral process. The result is an absence of checks and balances in Russia and the decision of one man to launch a wholly unjustified and brutal invassion of Iraq. I mean of Ukraine.""

Bush shrugged and said, under his breath, ""Iraq, too."" Russia has not invaded Iraq, and the Kremlin reportedly gave Saddam Hussein's government intelligence to combat the U.S. invasion early on.

BUSH CALLS ZELENSKYY ‘THE CHURCHILL OF OUR TIME’

""Anyway, 75,"" Bush added, referring to his age.

Bush presided over most of the war in Iraq, authorized by a bipartisan vote in both the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate in Oct. 2002. The war, which lasted until 2011, claimed the lives of more than 4,000 U.S. troops, along with those of tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians. Critics have long faulted Bush for the war, claiming that Iraq did not possess the weapons of mass destruction Bush feared.

The 2002 authorization cited many reasons to invade Iraq, however, including Iraq's alleged noncompliance with the 1991 ceasefire agreement' the country's ""brutal repression of its civilian population;"" the country's harboring of members of al-Qaeda in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks; Iraq's payment of bounties to the families of suicide bombers; and the governments of Turkey, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia fearing Saddam Hussein and wanting him removed.

Bush's gaffe clearly did not represent an attempt by the former president to acknowledge claims that the U.S. invasion of Iraq was ""brutal"" and ""wholly unjustified.""

Even so, many on Twitter poked fun at the former president.

""Oof. If you were George W. Bush, you think you’d just steer clear of giving any speech about one man launching a wholly unjustified and brutal invasion,"" former Rep. Justin Amash tweeted.

""George W. Bush is a war criminal,"" Nina Turner, a former Ohio state senator, tweeted.

""This is the most amazing Freudian slip of all time,"" Townhall writer Scott Morefield tweeted.

""George W. Bush didn't do a Freudian slip. He did a Freudian Confession,"" John Fuelsgang, a comedian and broadcaster, wrote on Twitter.

Bush's flub came as he praised Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Dallas Morning News reported.

‘Invasion’ language continues after El Paso Walmart shooting,"From inside a Texas Walmart in 2019 during one of the deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history, Adria Gonzalez heard the gunman shout epithets against Mexicans as she helped panicked shoppers toward the store exits.

She won't be there Wednesday when Patrick Crusius is expected to plead guilty in an El Paso courtroom to federal hate crime and firearms charges for the killing of 23 people. But she is angry federal prosecutors won't seek the death penalty over a racist attack that, according to investigators, was preceded by the shooter posting an online screed that warned of a ""Hispanic invasion"" of Texas.

""It's a slap in the face for us Latinos,"" Gonzalez said.

The expected guilty plea would amount to the first conviction in a case that has dragged on more than three years, and Crusius could still face the death penalty over separate state charges. But for Democrats and immigrant rights groups, there is a separate disappointment: How the description of an ""invasion"" on the U.S.-Mexico border has continued in American politics even after the El Paso shooting.

EL PASO WALMART SHOOTING SUSPECT WON’T FACE DEATH PENALTY, DOJ SAYS

From campaign stumps to hearings in Congress, Republicans have increasingly described high numbers of migrant crossings into the U.S. as an invasion threatening public safety and overwhelming border communities. Critics have condemned the characterization as anti-immigrant and dangerous in the aftermath of El Paso and other racially motivated attacks.

The issue flared again Tuesday during a hearing on border security in the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability, where Democrats accused the other side of fanning rhetoric against migrants. Republicans pushed back.

""For my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who want to state that we’re using this hearing for white nationalism, I’m not doing that,"" said Republican Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida, who is Black.

The Aug. 3, 2019, shooting happened on a busy weekend at a Walmart that is typically popular with shoppers from Mexico and the U.S. In addition to those killed, more than two dozen were injured and hundreds more were scarred by being present or having a loved-one hurt.

FLORIDA MASS SHOOTING SUSPECT LEADS POLICE ON CHASE, KILLED AFTER CARJACKING

Many of the dead and wounded were citizens of Mexico.

Crusius, 24, surrendered to police after the massacre, saying, ""I’m the shooter,"" and that he was targeting Mexicans, according to court records. Prosecutors have said he drove more than 10 hours from his hometown near Dallas to the largely-Latino border city and published a document online shortly before the shooting that said it was ""in response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas.""

Shortly after the shooting, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott came under criticism over a fundraising mailer dated the day before the attack that called on his supporters to ""defend Texas"" from immigrants entering the country illegally. He responded at the time by saying ""mistakes were made"" over the mailer, though did not elaborate or assign fault.

But Abbott has more recently embraced using the word ""invasion"" while authorizing a series of hard-line immigration measures, including a letter to state police and the Texas National Guard in November with the subject line ""Defend Texas Against Invasion.""

CALIFORNIA MASS SHOOTING: WHO IS SUSPECT HUU CAN TRAN?

Abbott has defended his statements by saying he is invoking language included in the U.S. Constitution. Some legal scholars have called it a misreading of the clause.

""If this is not an invasion, what is it?"" Abbott told CNN's Jake Tapper during an interview last month. ""Think about the volume of people coming across the border.""

Abbott's office did not return a request seeking comment Tuesday.

Texas state Sen. Roland Gutierrez, a Democrat whose district includes South Texas, said the language needs to stop. ""We are not at war here,"" he said.

MEMPHIS POLICE OFFICER IN CRITICAL CONDITION, ONE DEAD AFTER LIBRARY SHOOTING

America's Voice, an immigration reform group, said it tracked more than 80 Republican candidates during last year's midterm elections who amplified what they called ""invasion"" and ""replacement"" conspiracies.

""I think it’s been creeping over the years,"" said Zachary Mueller, political director of America's Voice. ""What I would say is that in 2021, there was a marked shift where it went from the fringes of the Republican Party into the mainstream of the Republican Party.""

A database of mass killings in the U.S. since 2006 compiled by The Associated Press, USA Today and Northeastern University shows that the number of deadly mass shootings linked to hate crimes has increased in recent years. Among 13 prominent instances, the 2019 Walmart shooting was the deadliest. The database tracks every mass killing — defined as four dead, not including the offender — in the U.S. since 2006.

It remains unclear when Crusius might still face trial on separate state charges in Texas. Gonzalez, who has been credited with saving lives in the Walmart, believes the death penalty would send a message.

David DePape assaulted Pelosi, 82, with a hammer just before 2:30 a.m. Friday at the couple's multimillion-dollar San Francisco estate, according to officials. Nancy Pelosi, the highest ranking member of the House, was not present in the home at the time.

San Francisco Police Chief William Scott told reporters Friday that police received a call at 2:27 a.m. for a report of a break-in at the home, and arrvied to find Pelosi and DePape ""both holding a hammer."" DePape, 42, ""pulled the hammer away from Mr. Pelosi and violently assaulted him with it,"" Scott said.

Officers then immediately tackled the suspect and took him into custody. Police are still investigating the motive, and did not provide additional details about the hammer used.

""Early this morning, an assailant broke into the Pelosi residence in San Francisco and violently assaulted Mr. Pelosi,"" Drew Hammill, spokesman for House Speaker Pelosi. ""The assailant is in custody and the motivation for the attack is under investigation.""

The Associated Press reported Pelosi was severely beaten with a hammer and suffered blunt force injuries. The attacker allegedly shouted, ""Where is Nancy, where is Nancy?"" a law enforcement source confirmed to Fox News.

He was taken to a nearby hospital and was ""expected to make a full recovery,"" Hamill said.

Scott told reporters DePape was charged with attempted homicide, assault with a deadly weapon, elder abuse, burglary and multiple more felonies.

CONGRESSIONAL LAWMAKERS AGHAST AFTER PELOSI'S HUSBAND ATTACKED DURING BREAK IN

The United States Capitol Police is working with the FBI and the San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) in the investigation, and said Nancy Pelosi was in Washington, D.C. with her security detail at the time of the break-in.

FBI agents could be seen at the home on Friday morning. In a statement provided to Fox News on Friday, a spokesperson for the FBI's San Francisco Field Office said investigators ""are working to determine the facts of what happened, including the motive behind the attack.""

""The FBI is provided resources such as investigators and forensic analysis from our Evidence Response Team,"" the statement continued. ""We have no further comment at this time.""

Paul Pelosi was most recently in the headlines after he pleaded guilty to DUI charges stemming from a May car crash in California.

Additionally, the couple’s sprawling Pacific Heights home has been the subject of attacks in the past.

Local news station KRON4 reported that vandals targeted the street-side residence in January 2021, when they covered the garage in spray-painted messages. Photos included in the KRON4 report also show what appear to be a pig’s head and fake blood.

Texas counties on the border and beyond declare ‘invasion’: Biden admin doesn’t ‘have the guts’ to act,"Officials from several Texas counties along the southern border announced a series of emergency declarations Tuesday to recognize the growing number of migrants in their communities amid what they said was lackluster support from the federal government.

Several county judges asked Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to dedicate more resources toward addressing illegal immigrant activity at the U.S.-Mexico border and to address the resulting crime and quality of life issues faced by border cities.

The declarations essentially recognized a state of ""invasion"" of illegal immigrants pouring into communities as local authorities have little-to-no resources to respond.

""We want America to know that this is real,"" Kinney County Judge Tully Shahan told reporters in Bracketville. ""The Biden administration won't do a thing about it. They could stop this thing this hour. They could stop it now. They don't have the guts.""

ARIZONA AG BRNOVICH ISSUES LEGAL OPINION DECLARING BORDER CRISIS ‘INVASION’ UNDER CONSTITUTION

In a statement to Fox News Digital, Abbott's press Secretary Renae Eze said ""All strategies remain on the table as Texas continues stepping up in the federal government’s absence.""

""While President Biden ignores the ever-growing humanitarian crisis, and Congressional members visit the border for photo-ops and then return to Washington to do nothing, Texas has deployed thousands of Texas National Guard soldiers and DPS troopers and spent over $4 billion of Texas taxpayer money to secure our border, including building our own border wall, erecting strategic barriers, and sending significant resources to help our local partners as was mentioned repeatedly in the Brackettville press conference, Eze said. ""This has resulted in over 274,000 migrant apprehensions, over 16,900 criminal arrests, including smugglers and human traffickers, over 22,000 turnbacks, and millions of lethal doses of fentanyl seized. It’s past time for President Biden—and for both parties in Congress—to do their jobs and secure our southern border. As the challenges on the border continue to increase, Texas will continue to take additional unprecedented action to address those challenges caused by the Biden Administration.""

Some officials said unprecedented illegal immigration has resulted in property damage, stolen vehicles, gun violence and other issues resulting from migrants crossing into their counties, many of which are desolate and have sparse populations.

""In my community, we have less than 1,000 residents. The thousand residents everyday live in fear of the invasion,"" said Dale Lynn Carruthers, the county judge for Terrell County. ""We are doing the best we can with limited manpower. Terrell County has the least to offer… but we have a lot of border coverage.""

Others talked about migrants crossing through school campuses and putting lives in danger while trying to flee U.S. Border Patrol agents and local and state authorities.

In May, Kinney County law enforcement documented more than 4,000 migrants who avoided apprehension by the Border Patrol, the county said in a news release. In June, authorities there prevented 67 smuggling attempts along county roadways, officials said.

Goliad County Judge Mike Bennett said his county has two stoplights and has a sheriff's department that has two deputies on duty at any given time.

""This is not a situation where we're helping these migrants come across. This is a situation where many are dying along the way,"" he said. ""There's a lot of carnage left in their wake.""

REPUBLICANS, HAWKS FEAR BORDER CRISIS WILL GET WORSE AFTER SCOTUS ‘REMAIN-IN-MEXICO’ RULING

""Clearly, it's the responsibility of the United States government to do this and clearly they're not going to do a thing,"" Bennett added.

With migrant numbers hitting historic levels, and with more than 239,000 migrant encounters in May alone, there has been considerable talk in conservative circles about the merits of declaring the crisis an ""invasion"" – which could open up a number of potential legal avenues for states.

Ken Cuccinelli, the former acting deputy secretary for the Department of Homeland Security, previously told Fox News Digital that the move by the Texas counties was significant and should now put more pressure on Abbott to make the declaration himself.

""The key here is you've got the first legal ruling that the southern border situation is an invasion,"" he said. "" One, that's obviously very significant, and two it's going to – as it should – put enormous pressure on Governor Abbott to adopt that position themselves and to respond accordingly.""

China edges closer to sending lethal aid to Russia as UN votes to condemn invasion of Ukraine: report,"Russia is in talks with China to purchase 100 combat drones, according to a new report published just days after Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the U.S. had evidence Beijing was weighing lethal aid to Moscow in its war against Ukraine.

Der Spiegel reports that Moscow is looking to commission a Chinese manufacturer to mass produce the drones – with a delivery date as early as April.

Per the report, Xian Bingo Intelligent Aviation Technology, a Chinese drone manufacturer, has said it was prepared to make 100 prototypes of its ZT-180 drone, which carry a 35-50 kg warhead.

The drones are similar to Iran’s Shaheed-136, which Russia has used to kill hundreds of Ukrainians and damage infrastructure.

The report, citing sources familiar with the matter, says Bingo had plans to establish a productive site for the drones in Russia.

FOX NEWS POLL: HALF SAY US SHOULD SUPPORT UKRAINE AS LONG AS IT TAKES

Fox News Digital has contacted the State Department for comment on the report but did not hear back before publication.

Former intelligence officer Rebekah Koffler argued that China's decision calculus is ""entirely rational"" as helping Russia militarily keeps the U.S. bogged down in Ukraine and focusing on the European theater as Beijing eyes Taiwan.

""The biggest challenge for the United States would be to have to be engaged in two wars simultaneously, albeit by proxy – one with Russia, on behalf of Ukraine, and the other with China, on behalf of Taiwan,"" Koffler said. ""There are concerns within the Pentagon about how long U.S. stockpile would last if Russia and China were to challenge us in a two-theater war.""

The Der Spiegel report comes days after Blinken, who met with China’s top diplomat Wang Yi in Munich over the weekend, said the U.S. has evidence that China is considering providing lethal support to Russia.

U.S. State Department spokesperson Ned Price warned Wednesday there would be ""consequences"" if China were to provide lethal aid to Russia in its war against Ukraine.

Also on Thursday, the U.N. General Assembly approved a nonbinding resolution that calls for Russia to end hostilities in Ukraine and withdraw its forces. The resolution, drafted by Ukraine in consultation with its allies, passed 141-7, with 32 abstentions.

""By overwhelmingly voting in favor of the UN General Assembly resolution today, these nations stood firmly in support of the rules-based international order, and spoke with one voice to demand Russia’s full, immediate, and unconditional withdrawal from all of Ukraine’s territory,"" National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said in a statement.

China’s support of Russia's Ukraine invasion has a breaking point: expert,"China has remained largely supportive of Russia amid the country’s invasion of Ukraine, but that support has a breaking point, according to one expert.

But if China faced harsh penalties in the form of tariffs, that would change.

""The friendship between the two peoples is ironclad.""

‘Clear indication’ where CCP stands

""The Chinese do have a strategic partnership and are unified by the fact that they're both opposed to a world in which America maintains a key, if not the pivotal, leadership role,"" he said.

Klinck said China is caught between not leaving Russia ""in a lurch,"" while also protecting itself from ""being painted with the same brush as North Korea, Eritrea, Syria and Belarus.""

The United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution last week condemning Russia’s invasion, with 141 nations voting in support of the resolution. China was among the 35 nations that abstained from voting, while Russia, Belarus, Eritrea, North Korea and Syria voted against the resolution.

PUTIN'S MISCALCULATION: RUSSIA UNDERESTIMATED THE UKRAINIANS' RESOLVE AND WESTERN BACKLASH, EXPERTS SAY

Eyes on Taiwan?

Since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, speculation has mounted about whether Chinese President Xi Jinping will take the opportunity to invade Taiwan.

China views Taiwan, which sits off the coast of mainland China, as a breakaway province that will one day be a part of the country. Taiwan operates as an independent country.

As Xi likely weighs whether to invade Taiwan, the strength of his military will also come into play.

Russia is grappling with a fledgling invasion as the Ukrainians continue battling their foe, leaving an estimated 3,000 Russian soldiers dead. Carafano said Russia is showing that ""no matter how incompetent [the Russian military is], they're really good at killing civilians.""

""It doesn't matter that they can't end wars. They've demonstrated that they're willing to start them ... lots of destruction and death, lots of refugees,"" he said, noting no one should view the war as proof the Russian miliary is not a problem.

CHINA TOUTS 'FRIENDSHIP' WITH RUSSIA: 'MOST IMPORTANT STRATEGIC PARTNER'

Carafano said China has a similar issue with its military. It hasn't gotten into any wars to demonstrate its aptitude.

""The Chinese military has similar problems to the Russians in that they actually haven't fought wars. And if you actually look at the Chinese operations on the border with India, they're not terribly impressive. The Chinese haven't actually demonstrated the capacity to do large-scale military operations,"" Carafano said.

Nations sometimes need to be ""more thoughtful about deterring reckless, incompetent people than deterring competent enemies,"" Carafano said.

Since Russia launched its Ukraine invasion, more than 2 million Ukrainians have fled to neighboring countries, according to the U.N.

"China's Xi has ordered military to be ready for Taiwan invasion by 2027, CIA Director Burns says","CIA Director William Burns has revealed that Chinese President Xi Jinping has instructed his country’s army ""to be ready by 2027 to conduct a successful invasion"" of Taiwan.

Burns made the remark Thursday during an event at Georgetown University, where he also said he believes that Xi has been closely watching Russian President Vladimir Putin’s prolonged and costly invasion of Ukraine. Beijing has been engaged in a tense territorial dispute with the island, which it claims is part of China.

""On Taiwan, I guess I would say our assessment at CIA is that I wouldn’t underestimate President Xi’s ambitions with regard to Taiwan. He has been pretty clear about that over the years,"" Burns said. ""I think he has watched very carefully – it seems to us – Putin’s experience in Ukraine and been a little bit unsettled and sobered by that as well.

""We know as a matter of intelligence he has instructed the People’s Liberation Army to be ready by 2027 to conduct a successful invasion,"" Burns continued.

"For China's military planners, Taiwan is not an easy island to invade","China could invade Taiwan. Its military dwarfs the island nation's armed forces, but any invasion would likely be more akin to the brutal Allied WWII landings on Normandy than the swift victory of Operation Desert Storm in the first Gulf War in 1991.

Roughly 100 miles from China and around the size of Maryland, not only is the island of Taiwan surrounded by a protective watery moat, but it is also an island with geographic features that make it an extremely poor candidate for an invasion – no matter how powerful that invading force might be.

Observers note that that in 1944, the U.S. military scrapped Operation Causeway, a plan to invade Taiwan (then a Japanese colony called Formosa) because it was deemed too costly. U.S. military planners concluded that invading and holding Formosa would require a total American assault force of half a million men. The Pentagon tallied up the number of U.S. casualties expected from an invasion and subsequent mountain, jungle and urban fighting and that number was staggering being - as many as 150,000.

Taiwan has been preparing to be invaded since the 1950s, and as such has a solid intelligence apparatus, troops trained for the single mission of repelling Chinese forces, plenty of powerful modern military hardware and formidable defensives in place along every possible landing area. Due to the hilly terrain, the troops of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) would face pulverizing firepower raining down on them from heavily fortified defensive positions.

REPUBLICANS READY BILL TO LEASE TAIWAN WEAPONS IN STAND OFF WITH CHINA

Observers believe it is unlikely that China would just bomb Taiwan into submission; however, while cruise missile attacks on Taiwanese military targets are a real concern, it is believed that Beijing would very much prefer to keep Taiwan’s infrastructure – especially anything connected to the semiconductor industry – relatively unscathed.

Semiconductors are vital parts of everything from weapons systems to automobiles and Taiwan is the planet’s biggest manufacturer. Market intelligence firm TrendForce reports that ""Taiwan dominates the world's semiconductor manufacturing industry – controlling 48% of the foundry market and 61% of the world's capacity to build at 16nm (nanometer) or better.""

Additionally – while useful as a scare tactic – China’s military leaders are aware that indiscriminate bombings would inevitably kill civilians. Such killings could easily turn generations of Taiwanese into mortal enemies rather than people who might – even very reluctantly – come to accept a return to the ""embrace of the Motherland."" Plus, Taiwan has missiles, too – some of which Taipei says can hit Beijing.

Kitsch Liao, a military and cyber affairs consultant with Taipei-based Doublethink Lab who has also looked into China’s invasion scenarios, told Fox News Digital that aside from terrain and the fact that there is only a relatively short window when the Taiwan Strait is calm enough for a reasonably safe crossing by a navy, people often overlook simple logistics. ""Typically, any military unit carries no more than three days’ worth of supplies with them,"" Liao says, ""which means they either have to be resupplied, or scrounge whatever they can from the field.

Liao notes that ammunition is heavy, bulky, and used up quickly. The PLA cannot – except on an ad hoc basis – use ammunition captured from Taiwan. ""This means they’ll have to bring over an enormous amount of equipment,"" says Liao.

""A successful landing would be a Pyrrhic victory for China. Far from completing their missions, the amphibious landing ships would potentially be required to go back and forth the Taiwan Strait (becoming extremely vulnerable and lucrative targets) in order to provide onshore forces with supplies,"" Liao said.

NANCY PELOSI'S ASIA VISIT ITINERARY LEAVES OUT MENTION OF POSSIBLE STOP IN TAIWAN

Just because invading Taiwan would be a painfully bad idea does not mean China will not attempt it, but the realities of an invasion, some observers believe, meant it's more likely a last, rather than first option.

Many military experts and China watchers agree that ""strangulation"" scenarios such a quarantine blockade, would be much more effective than consigning possibly hundreds of thousands of Chinese soldiers to death, and thereafter committing perhaps a million troops to pacify Taiwan.

""Xi Jinping could be suffering from a god complex that blinds him to the terrible risks associated with an invasion of Taiwan. A rational strategic leader would choose another course of action, such as a long campaign of coercion to isolate and blockade Taiwan,"" noted Taiwan expert Ian Easton.

When asked whether House Speaker Nancy Pelosi should visit the island nation, Easton told Fox News Digital that the U.S. should not be intimidated by Beijing’s threats. ""It is vital American leaders visit Taipei and signal that the U.S. stands in solidarity with democracies in peril,"" he said.

""Foregoing visits in the face of coercion would play right into the Chinese Communist Party’s hands.""

FORMER CHINESE STATE MEDIA EDITOR SUGGESTS NANCY PELOSI BE 'RESTRAINED,' 'PUNISHED' BY CCP FOR VISITING TAIWAN

Easton is the senior director and research fellow at the Virginia-based Project 2049 Institute and wrote a book called ""The Chinese Invasion Threat.""

His book details examples of literal and figurative minefields the People’s Liberation army, navy, and air force could find themselves enmeshed in should they attempt to liberate Taiwan. Easton and others further note that, of course, there would be no possibility of surprise; preparations for an invasion are impossible to hide.

Islands are often associated with coastlines of sandy beaches, but Taiwan has surprisingly few. Additionally, about 75% of the island is mountainous, with more than 200 of Taiwan’s peaks reaching well over 9,000 feet, according to National Geographic magazine.

Easton lists 14 beaches in Taiwan that could be invasion options but writes, ""Unfortunately for Chinese generals …Taiwan’s 770-mile-long coastline is remarkably unsuited for amphibious operations.""

Another challenge is the Taiwan-controlled islands of Matsu – and especially – Kinmen (formerly known as Quemoy), both located just off the coast of China. These mini fortresses would not be easy to take out, but they would need to be captured before any attack on the Taiwan mainland.

Defense Secretary Austin 'seriously doubts' China invasion of Taiwan is 'imminent',"Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin looked to ease concerns Wednesday and said he ""seriously doubts"" that China’s increased aggression around Taiwan means that Beijing is planning an imminent invasion.

""We've seen increased aerial activity in the straits, we've seen increased surface vessel activity around Taiwan,"" Austin said standing alongside Secretary of State Antony Blinken and their Japanese counterparts in a press conference.

""But whether or not that means that an invasion is imminent, you know, I seriously doubt that,"" he added.

Despite Austin’s comments, the U.S. has bolstered its relations with nations like Japan, South Korea and Australia to unite in the face of North Korean and Chinese aggression.

Austin renewed the U.S.’s post-World War II commitment to defend Japan ""with the full range of capabilities"" – which includes nuclear weapons – and underscored that these commitments under Article 5 of the Mutual Security Treaty applies to the Senkaku Islands as well.

Located in the East China Sea, the Senkaku Islands are internationally recognized as Japanese territory following the 1895 Sino-Japanese War, but China contests this and lays claim to the uninhabited islands that Beijing calls Diaoyu.

Blinken told reporters Wednesday that the People’s Republic of China (PRC) is the ""greatest shared strategic challenge"" for the U.S. and its allies and applauded Tokyo’s commitment to double its defense spending by 2027.

The U.S. and Japanese officials said China’s aggressive foreign policy is looking to change the international order to bolster Beijing’s global prowess, and together, the American and Japanese officials unveiled plans to strengthen security in the region.

"Iran, Turkey blame Kurds for domestic problems and protests to justify invasion, air bombings: expert","The Kurdish people face assaults from both sides as Turkey prepares to invade Syria and Iran runs an air campaign against Iraqi Kurdistan.

Turkish authorities arrested a Syrian Arab woman whom they claim confessed to a deadly bombing in an Istanbul market that killed six people and injured dozens of others. The authorities determined that she had entered the country on orders of the Kurdistan Worker’s Party (PKK), but the group denied involvement.

Erdogan used the attack to authorize the start of ""Operation Sword-Claw,"" which started with targeted air strikes aimed to take out the People’s Defense Units (YPG), whom he also blamed for the bombing.

A Kurdish general told Fox News last week that NATO ally Turkey is planning to carry out a massive ground invasion of Syria in an effort to target the same Kurdish groups that partnered with the U.S. military in its campaign against ISIS.

All countries surrounding Turkey have Kurds of some sort in them since the Kurdish people have no designated homeland. About 10% of Turkey's population is itself Kurdish, and some 40 million Kurds lived throughout the region as of 2019.

As Turkey gets its wider offensive underway, the Kurdish people also face an offensive from Iran in northern Iraq.

Iran has faced protests over the past three months following the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini. Police allegedly beat and hospitalized the girl after determining she breached the country’s hijab (headscarf) laws.

Adel Bakawan, director of the French Research Centre on Iraq, argued that Iran has tried to turn the protests into a ""divisive ethnic force,"" but failing to stop the protests from reaching a nationwide level, the government has turned towards a foreign enemy to blame for the protests.

US leaders predicted Kyiv's swift fall after Russian invasion. Why were they so wrong?,"As Russia massed a large military presence on its border with Ukraine weeks before launching its invasion, Western intelligence officials were concerned the capital city of Kyiv could fall in a matter of days amid a Russian assault.

Now two weeks into the conflict, the capital remained in Ukrainian hands and Russian troops have failed to make substantial progress as opposition forces continue to put up fierce resistance. Russian forces were reportedly trying to encircle the city, but the loss of equipment and personnel has taken its toll and significantly slowed their advance.

Meanwhile, Moscow has targeted several Ukrainian cities with devastating airstrikes that have left civilians dead and forced many to flee to neighboring countries.

RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES

The predictions that Kyiv would fall, a major Russian objective, represented an intelligence failure, though not a major one, said Rebekah Koffler, a former Defense Intelligence Agency officer and author of ""Putin's Playbook: Russia's Secret Plan to Defeat America.""

Part of the misstep by intelligence officials was the influence of previous events, she said, citing the disastrous withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan, the Sept. 11 attacks and the Iraq War.

""They're a little bit influenced by that and they wanted to telegraph to the policymakers the urgency,"" Koffler told Fox News.

Milley's prediction

In early February, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley told lawmakers during a closed-door briefing that Kyiv could fall within 72 hours after a full-scale Russian invasion. He said the operation could result in 15,000 Ukrainian military deaths and 4,000 Russian troop deaths.



RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: INTEL OFFICIALS PREDICT ‘UGLY’ WEEKS AHEAD AS PUTIN DOUBLES DOWN

That prediction, like predictions regarding how long Afghanistan's army could last without U.S. support, has already been disproved. Kyiv has held out long past the dire prognostication. The war grinds on. Last week, Russia claimed it had lost 498 military personnel, a figure widely disputed by the Pentagon, which put the death toll somewhere between 2,000 and 4,000. Ukraine has claimed nearly 11,000 Russian military deaths and the Kremlin is believed to be actively concealing the true number.

The fact remains that Kyiv did not fall, and Afghanistan did not stand, despite Milley's speculations in May 2021 that the U.S.-backed government there could.

""It's not a foregone conclusion, in my professional military estimate, that the Taliban automatically win and Kabul falls, or any of those kind of dire predictions,"" Milley said during a news briefing at the time. ""There's a significant military capability in the Afghan government, and we have to see how this plays out.""

Afghanistan fell swiftly to the Taliban after the U.S. military shuttered Bagram Air Base. Milley, along with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, was among the Biden administration leaders who green-lit that plan. They are now helping direct the U.S. response to Russia's aggression in Ukraine.

The fighting between both sides has moved closer to Kyiv as civilians continue to be targeted by Russian shelling. On Monday, Ukrainian officials claimed to have downed two Russian aircraft over the area and Russian artillery units have shelled the outer portions of the city.

From a manpower standpoint, Russia has sent nearly 100% of its combat forces into Ukraine, Defense Department officials said Monday. This is an unusual move: Armed forces tend to keep numbers in reserve outside the theater of combat. In addition, Moscow was recruiting Syrian fighters to back up the Russian army as the Kremlin struggled to contain its losses, along with global condemnation over the invasion and political and economic isolation. Moscow has already reportedly sent Chechen forces to hunt down Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and those forces have reportedly been eliminated by the Ukrainians.

Pete Marocco, former deputy assistant Secretary of State for conflict and stabilization operations, told Fox News that predictions about whether Kyiv would fall to Russian troops came before the Beijing Winter Olympics in February.

""I’m not sure it was an intelligence failure. I don’t know that it was an inaccurate statement to say that it could have fallen within 72 hours,"" he said. ""As time languished on, Ukraine became prepared.""

He noted that such dire warnings could possibly be messaged with the intent of spurring one’s allies to make necessary preparations or possibly overcompensating for the miscalculations in Afghanistan.

‘Lull before the start’

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine came days after the end of the Winter Games, a misstep on Putin’s part, said Marocco. The reason why he waited to begin military operations is left to speculation, he said.

""I don’t see him as having that sort of sensitivity or caring unless there might have been some sort of tactic or mutual agreement with China,"" Marocco said. ""If he did that, that would be a surprising strategic blunder on his part. I tend to think that there’s another explanation behind the scenes as to why there was this lull before the start. Perhaps to allow predictable sanctions targets enough time to move assets before U.S. sanctions would be put in place.""

As the war rages, intelligence warnings of the downfall of Kyiv are irrelevant, said Daniel Hoffman, a retired CIA Senior Clandestine Services Officer. He added that intelligence doesn't make predictions.

""The Russian logistics suck. The supply chain sucks. Zelenskyy has been a hero. Ukrainians have stepped up to fight,"" he told Fox News. ""It's always on a spectrum. You ask some CIA analyst and they would have said: ‘I have a low medium or high level of confidence that the fight could last this long or that long.’""

"Russia's invasion of Ukraine failed on numerous fronts, so Putin turns to 'Plan D' to 'save face'","Former deputy national security adviser K.T. McFarland told Fox News Digital that Russia has fallen back on ""Plan D"" after failing to maintain a protracted siege in Kyiv.

Russia re-evaluated its strategy and on March 25 began to pivot focus toward securing eastern Ukraine, which culminated in the surprise withdrawal from Kyiv and surrounding cities – a move that some intelligence and military experts claim is little more than an attempt to save face after a military disaster.

RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES

""Their Plan A was to mass along the border as if to invade, and assume Ukraine would capitulate on NATO membership and Donbas,"" McFarland said. ""When Ukraine did not, Russia’s Plan B was to invade and be in control in a few days.""

""When that didn’t happen Russia moved to Plan C – protracted war and siege,"" she continued. ""When that didn’t work, they’ve moved to Plan D – consolidate in east and a frozen conflict along the border: spin it as a success back home, come back for rest of Ukraine in a few years.""

McFarland said the prevailing belief – hers included – prior to the invasion was that Russia would aim to take the Donbas/eastern provinces. She labeled the full invasion a Russian intelligence and military failure, stressing that Russia failed to anticipate the Ukrainian leaders and people.

""Presumably, they thought Ukrainian leaders had been bought and would flee, and Russia could install a puppet government,"" she added.

PUTIN SHAKES UP LEADERSHIP IN UKRAINE WAR AS DEFENSE OFFICIALS WARN OF EASTWARD FOCUS

Fredrick Kagan, director of the Critical Threats Project at the American Enterprise Institute, went a step further and said the Donbas region was little more than a ""consolation prize"" to make up for the ""sacrifice"" in Putin’s campaign.

""The overall objective of the invasion was to replace the Zelenskyy government with a government that Moscow could control,"" Kagan said. ""That effort has failed.""

Kagan explained that the ""Putin World"" explanation is that Russia has ""bizarrely"" claimed to have achieved its objective around Kyiv and is now working to secure the land claimed by proxy republics Moscow has recognized.

FORMER UKRAINE PRESIDENT: PUTIN IS CONDUCTING AN ‘ANTI-HUMAN WAR,' ATROCITIES ‘HAPPENING EVERY SINGLE DAY’

But securing those regions could provide a long-term purpose, which is to continue eroding Ukrainian territory and improving future invasion efforts.

""The more Ukrainian territory Russia has the harder it is to keep an independent Ukraine alive over time, and the more opportunities Putin will have to invade again after he’s built up his military or to do other things to achieve his aim to bring down an independent Ukrainian government,"" Kagan argued.

The extreme losses in Ukraine have pushed Russia to ""frantically"" rush to build up the military again, with a more robust conscription effort and other short-cut methods that will allow them to field something of an army.

Ultimately, Kagan believes that as long as Putin or ""Putinism"" remains dominant in Russia, it will continue seeking to destroy an independent Ukraine.

""This was never about Donbas, and it’s also never been about NATO, primarily,"" Kagan said. ""[Putin] does not accept Ukraine has the right to an independent government, he does not accept Ukraine’s sovereignty and he does not accept its existence as an independent state.""",https://www.foxnews.com/world/mcfarland-russia-plan-d-after-failing-siege-kyiv,N/A
Protesters brand Australia national holiday 'Invasion Day',"Australians have turned out to protest against the country’s national holiday, branding the day as ""Invasion Day"" as they demand recognition of harm against the Indigenous population.

""Let us all recognize the unique privilege that we have to share this continent with the world's oldest continuous culture,"" Australian Prime Minster Anthony Albanese said of the holiday at a flag-raising ceremony to mark the 235th anniversary.

Australia Day marks the day that a British fleet first landed on the continent and proclaimed sovereignty over the land. In Sydney, the capital of New South Wales, a large crowd gathered to proclaim the day ""Invasion Day"" instead – the day when the British took the land from the Aboriginal peoples.

Protesters carried Aboriginal flags, and an Indigenous smoking ceremony took place.

IRAQI PROTESTERS RALLY NEAR COUNTRY'S CENTRAL BANK REGARDING THE RECENT DEVALUATION OF THE DINAR

Another protest in South Australia’s Adelaide drew around 2,000 attendees, according to the Australian Broadcasting Company.

While Albanese raised a flag for Australia in the nation’s capital of Canberra, Deniliquin Aboriginal leader Laura Hand-Ross of the Wamba Wamba and Mutthi Mutthi peoples lowered the people’s flag to half-mast to recognize that ""for many Aboriginal people across the country, January 26 is a day of mourning,"" The Guardian reported.

""I would hazard a guess that in five years’ time, I probably will start calling it Survival Day,"" she said, adding that she has always referred to the holiday as ""Invasion Day."" ""But for me, it symbolizes significant changes for all of our people across Australia and particularly in New South Wales, of the absolute annihilation of almost all of our people.""

An annual poll found that nearly one-third of Australians believe that the day should be officially rebranded as ""Invasion Day.""

CRITICS CALL OUT BIDEN ADMINISTRATION FOR NOT WALKING AWAY FROM IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL DESPITE RECENT RHETORIC

In an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal, executive director of the Center for Independent Studies in Australia Tom Switzer urged his fellow countrymen to ""annoy the woke left"" and ""celebrate Australia Day.""

Switzer acknowledged that ""only a lunatic would be proud"" of the various land thefts and indigenous exploitations that occurred under the British Empire, but he also highlighted the ""great common achievements"" of the British past, which he saw under threat from Australians who teach the youth to ""feel shame about their nation’s British heritage.""

""The defeat of Germany and Japan in 1945 come to mind, but so does the export of the rule of law and parliamentary systems to nations around the world,"" Switzer wrote.

""Never mind that if the British hadn’t colonized Australia, another nation would have done so: the French or Dutch perhaps, or even the Japanese,"" he continued. ""Never mind, too, that Australia has in the ensuing 235 years established itself as one of the world’s leading nations, embracing humane values such as the rule of law, liberty and democracy.""

TURKEY SAYS SWEDISH DECISION NOT TO PROBE KURD PROTEST ‘ABSURD’

""National and state governments have striven to include and support indigenous people and to ensure they are equal under the law in every respect,"" he noted. ""No one would pretend that the past treatment of indigenous people was acceptable by today’s standards. But those days are gone, and history can’t be undone.""

Despite the significant unhappiness with the current holiday, Albanese said that there is no plan for change, though he noted that it was a ""difficult day"" for the Indigenous peoples.

Albanese’s Labor Party has also planned a referendum that will recognize Indigenous people in the nation’s constitution and establish a group called the Voice to consult on any decisions that might affect Aboriginal lives.

""It is a great country,"" Albanese said of the referendum. ""Australia will be even better when we recognize our First Nations people in our constitution.""

Some companies have tried to acknowledge the discontentment, with telecom company Telstra Corp LTD offering its employees the day off.

Putin initiates conscription to bolster military invasion as Ukraine mounts counteroffensive,"Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a partial mobilization in Russia, which will require citizens to join the war effort in Ukraine. He also warned Western nations not to attack Russia's territories, which would be met with swift retaliation.

Putin’s address on Wednesday comes as Russia’s invasion reaches nearly seven months and amid a successful counteroffensive by Ukraine’s military.

Conscription is ""fully adequate to the threats we face, namely to protect our homeland, its sovereignty and territorial integrity, to ensure the security of our people and people in the liberated territories,"" he said.

""We are talking about partial mobilization, that is, only citizens who are currently in the reserve will be subject to conscription, and above all, those who served in the armed forces have a certain military specialty and relevant experience,"" Putin said.

RUSSIAN TROOPS BOXED IN BY UKRAINIAN FORCES AND DNIEPER RIVER, BARGE CARRYING SUPPLIES TO RUSSIAN TROOPS SINKS

Putin’s partial mobilization is set to start on Wednesday.

The statement also comes one day after Russia announced it intends to hold elections in Russian-controlled regions in eastern and southern Ukraine. This would allow these regions to join Russia. Such elections would undoubtedly escalate the war.

Putin has threatened the West not to interfere. He also discouraged them from ""nuclear blackmail"" or using nukes against Russia.

""To those who allow themselves such statements regarding Russia, I want to remind you that our country also has various means of destruction, and for separate components and more modern than those of NATO countries and when the territorial integrity of our country is threatened, to protect Russia and our people, we will certainly use all the means at our disposal,"" Putin said.

""It’s not a bluff,"" the Russian president added.

The referendums are set to start Friday in the Luhansk, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk regions.

Should these regions successfully vote to join Russia, the deputy head of Russia’s Security Council said it would enable his country to use ""any means"" to defend them. Such a vote to join Russia is also seen as ""irreversible,"" Dmitry Medvedev added.

PUTIN DETERMINED TO PURSUE 'UNIFYING INTERNATIONAL AGENDA,' RUSSIA LOOKS TO ANNEX EASTERN UKRAINE

On Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned these efforts and said such votes amount to just ""noise.""

""The situation on the front line clearly indicates that the initiative belongs to Ukraine,"" he said. ""Our positions do not change because of the noise or any announcements somewhere. And we enjoy the full support of our partners in this.""

The referendum votes, which were also dismissed by Western leaders, are expected to go in Russia's favor.

""I thank all friends and partners of Ukraine for today’s mass principled firm condemnation of Russia’s attempts to stage new sham referenda,"" Zelenskyy said.

UKRAINE MILITARY SUPPORT INCOMING WITH NATO BOOSTING RAPID REACTION FORCE

US Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink said the ""sham referenda and mobilization are signs of weakness [and] of Russian failure.""

""The United States will never recognize Russia's claim to purportedly annexed Ukrainian territory, and we will continue to stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes,"" she added.

UK Defense Secretary Ben Wallace similarly responded to Putin's comments in a tweet Wednesday.

""President Putin's breaking of his own promises not to mobilize parts of his population and the illegal annexation of parts of Ukraine, are an admission that his invasion is failing,"" he said. ""He and his Defense Minister have sent tens of thousands of their own citizens to their deaths, ill-equipped and badly led.""

""No amount of threats and propaganda can hide the fact that Ukraine is winning this war, the international community are united and Russia is becoming a global pariah.""

The Defense Ministry also released an intelligence update concerning the ongoing war efforts between Ukraine and Russia.

""These referendums follow the Russian Duma’s formal recognition of the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics on 21 February 2022,"" the ministry said. ""This urgency is likely driven by fears of imminent Ukrainian attack and an expectation of greater security after formally becoming part of Russia.""

""The Russian civilian and military leadership has faced significant pressure over the last two weeks. These new measures have highly likely been brought forwards due to public criticism and mark a further development in Russia’s strategy,"" it added.

Putin laid out his Ukraine invasion rationale back in July 2021,"Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine Wednesday evening, further escalating tensions that hit a fever pitch after Putin recognized two breakaway regions of the country, but he may have dropped some warning signs regarding an invasion back in July 2021.

Putin referred to centuries of Russian and Ukrainian history to claim that the idea of an independent Ukraine is part of an ""anti-Russia"" propaganda campaign tracing back to Russia's geopolitical foes in Eastern Europe going back centuries. The Russian president concluded that Ukraine's ""true sovereignty"" is ""only possible in partnership with Russia.""

BIDEN RESPONDS TO RUSSIA'S INVASION OF UKRAINE: ‘THE WORLD WILL HOLD RUSSIA ACCOUNTABLE’

""I am confident that true sovereignty of Ukraine is possible only in partnership with Russia,"" he wrote. ""Our spiritual, human and civilizational ties formed for centuries and have their origins in the same sources, they have been hardened by common trials, achievements and victories. … Together we have always been and will be many times stronger and more successful. For we are one people.""

Putin noted that ""Russians, Ukrainians, and Belarusians are all descendants of Ancient Rus, which was the largest state in Europe. Slavic and other tribes across the vast territory … were bound together by one language (which we now refer to as Old Russian), economic ties, the rule of the princes of the Rurik dynasty, and – after the baptism of Rus – the Orthodox faith.""

‘A big common country’

The Russian president noted that the name ""Ukraine"" emerged in written sources in the 1100s A.D., tracing back to the Old Russian world ""okraina"" (pheriphery). ""And the word ‘Ukrainian’, judging by archival documents, originally referred to frontier guards who protected the external borders."" He used the term ""Malorussia"" (little Russia) to refer to Ukraine.

""Malorussians in many ways helped build a big common country – its statehood, culture, and science,"" Putin wrote, noting that natives of Ukraine held major positions of leadership in the USSR.

Yet Russia's historical enemies – Poland and Austria-Hungary – crafted narratives to separate Ukraine from Russia, Putin argued. He noted ""the desire of the leaders of the Polish national movement to exploit the ‘Ukrainian issue’ to their own advantage."" Putin claimed that ""there was no historical basis"" for dividing Ukraine from Russia, so ""conclusions were substantiated by all sorts of concoctions, which went as far as to claim that the Ukrainians are the true Slavs and the Russians, the Muscovites, are not.""

""In essence, Ukraine's ruling circles decided to justify their country's independence through the denial of its past,"" Putin charged. ""They began to mythologize and rewrite history, edit out everything that united us, and refer to the period when Ukraine was part of the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union as an occupation.""

‘A springboard against Russia’

""Step by step, Ukraine was dragged into a dangerous geopolitical game aimed at turning Ukraine into a barrier between Europe and Russia, a springboard against Russia,"" he claimed. ""The owners of this project took as a basis the old groundwork of the Polish-Austrian ideologists to create an ‘anti-Moscow Russia’.""

Putin lamented what he described as Ukraine's economic problems, claiming that they resulted from corrupt Ukrainian authorities ""who waisted [sic] and frittered away the achievements of many generations,"" separating Ukraine from Russia, even though they are ""natural complementary economic partners."" He claimed that hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians come to Russia to work, ""and they find a welcome reception and support. So that's what the ‘aggressor state’ is.""

Reporter's Notebook: Making Russia pay for Ukraine invasion,"One way or another, realistically or not, there is a certain expectation that Russia will have to pay for what it has destroyed in Ukraine. You break it, you pay for it. That reconstruction, however, is a way off. There is no point rebuilding what may be bombed again. As long as the war rages, talk of reconstructing Ukraine seems somewhat theoretical. But arming it is urgent business if Kyiv is to continue to claw back territory lost and defend itself. Bill Browder thinks Russia needs to pick up that tab, too.

""We’re in a situation now where people in the West are starting to complain about sending money to Ukraine for defense and for financial assistance when there are so many economic problems in other parts of the world and at home,"" Browder, head of the Global Magnitsky Justice Campaign and author of the book ""Freezing Order,"" tells Fox News.

""The easy solution to this problem is that there are $350 billion of Russian Central Bank hard currency reserves that have been frozen. And so it makes total logical sense that that money should be used not just for reconstruction of Ukraine but for the defense of Ukraine. In my opinion, this is probably the single most important factor that will determine the outcome of the war.""

RUSSIA RELYING ON WWII GROUND TACTICS LEAVES VULNERABILITIES TO MODERN WARFARE: UK DEFENSE

As such, Browder considers the idea of having frozen Russian Central Bank assets go to arms for Ukraine an ""elegant"" solution to the cost of conflict crisis, and he’s on a mission to make it happen. Aid to Ukraine has become a political football in Washington, as another disputed budget deadline looms amidst fears of a possible government shutdown before year-end. Republicans want President Biden to stop writing ""blank checks"" and have been crying out for greater oversight of the money spent on Kyiv. Some would like to see those dollars instead spent on America’s southern border. Browder says any drag on Ukraine’s military momentum now—any clipping of its wings—would be catastrophic.

""If Ukraine doesn’t win this war, then we will be at war with Russia next. Putin will be at the Estonian border, and he’ll be threatening a NATO country. And then we have two very terrible choices to make. We can either choose to go to war with Russia, which will be disastrous for us. Or even worse—we can choose to abrogate our obligations under NATO and let Putin take Estonia.""

Laws on sovereign immunity stand in the way of diverting frozen Russian Central Bank funds to arms for Ukraine. Money that belongs to governments can’t just be expropriated. Browder argues that is surmountable. Laws, he believes, can be changed, especially when arguments about ""breaking legal precedent"" ring increasingly hollow.

""Vladimir Putin is breaking all legal precedents by invading a neighboring country. Redrawing the map of Europe. And as he’s expanding the definition of criminality. We have to adjust laws to take that into account.""

BRITTNEY GRINER TRADE DEAL LEAVES WRONGFULLY DETAINED AMERICANS MARC FOGEL, PAUL WHELAN IN LIMBO

Browder said he’s suggesting to different lawmakers around the world that in specific and unique circumstances, such as ""when a country invades its neighbor unprovoked, if they’re involved in genocide and various other horrible crimes"" sovereign immunity shouldn’t apply.

Browder has some experience working the powers of persuasion when it comes to forcing justice to be served. When Moscow wouldn’t press charges for the death—many say murder—of his accountant Sergei Magnitsky in a Russian prison—Browder drew up a list of those he deemed responsible for the death and after a long lobbying effort, got them punished.

""I’ve been there before,"" he says referring back to that. ""Thirteen years ago, I started to advocate for the passage of something called the Magnitsky Act which would freeze the assets of foreign officials who are involved in human rights abuse."" He said that lots of bureaucrats pushed back along the way, arguing, ""This can’t be done. But we got it done. It took thirteen years. I hope that this one goes a lot faster.""

"Russia asked China for military, economic aid in Ukraine conflict following invasion","Russia asked China for military and economic aid following their invasion of Ukraine, Fox News has confirmed.

In an attempt to protect intelligence sources, U.S. officials have been reluctant to detail what type of aid is being sought.

The request for military assistance, which was first reported by The New York Times, has reportedly raised concern among U.S. officials that China might interfere with any efforts from Western nations to assist Ukrainian forces.

""We are communicating directly, privately to Beijing, that there will absolutely be consequences for large-scale sanctions evasion efforts or support to Russia to backfill them,"" National Security adviser Jake Sullivan said Sunday.

""We will not allow that to go forward and allow there to be a lifeline to Russia from these economic sanctions from any country, anywhere in the world,"" he said.

Sullivan also suggested that China had some idea that Russian President Vladimir Putin was planning something, but conceded the Chinese might not have known the extent of Putin's intentions.

Chinese leaders have declined to rebuke Putin for his invasion of Ukraine, and have come out against Western economic sanctions. China has abstained in multiple United Nations votes to censure Russia.

Last Wednesday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki claimed that ""China has seemingly endorsed this propaganda"" about the U.S. developing chemical weapons in Ukraine.

""To be honest, I couldn’t even understand why we did not do it earlier,"" he said Saturday on RT. ""Why in 2014, you know, there were demonstrations in Kharkiv, people were carrying enormous tricolors and shouting, ‘Russia, Russia, Russia,’ in Donbas and Odesa, as well, you know!""

Russia’s all-out attack on Ukraine has killed at least 57 people and wounded 169 during the first day of President Vladimir Putin's full-scale invasion, Ukraine’s Health Minister Oleh Lyashko said Thursday.

President Biden said Thursday afternoon that he’s reached a full agreement with G7 leaders to limit Russia’s ability to be part of the global economy, stunt their ability to finance and grow Russia’s military and impair their ability to compete in a high-tech, 21st century economy.

RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES

In a public address from the White House, Biden said Putin has much larger ambitions than Ukraine and wants to ""reestablish the Soviet Union.""

Secretary of Defense Gen. Lloyd Austin ordered the deployment of approximately 7,000 additional U.S. troops to Germany in a move aimed at bolstering NATO defense and deterring Russian aggression.

The wide-ranging attack on Ukraine hit cities and bases with airstrikes or shelling, as civilians piled into trains and cars to flee the country. Ukraine's government said Russian tanks and troops rolled across the border in a ""full-scale war"" that could rewrite the geopolitical order.

After several hours of fierce battle, Russian forces seized control of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy earlier Thursday raised concerns of repeated of the 1986 disaster.

A senior U.S. Defense Department official told reporters earlier Thursday that Putin’s goal appears to be seizing the capital of Kyiv, ""decapitating the government"" and ""installing his own method of governance.""

He claimed Putin indicated this himself during his overnight speech.

However, the defense official emphasized that, ""U.S. troops are not going to be fighting the war in Ukraine."" The U.S. military has no aircraft in Ukrainian airspace as of Wednesday morning, he said.

Russia has launched more than 100 ballistic missiles into Ukraine since its initial onslaught overnight. Starting around 9:30 p.m. EST Wednesday, Russian forces began launching missiles from land and sea-based platforms from the Black Sea toward key cities in central and eastern Ukraine, the official said.

The official said Russian forces were fighting all three major axes ""designed to take key population centers."" The heaviest fighting has been occurring near an axis from northeast of Ukraine to the south, starting from Belarus to an advance on the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv.

RUSSIA CRACKS DOWN ON ANTI-WAR PROTESTS, MORE THAN 1,700 DEMONSTRATORS ARRESTED

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson condemned Russia's attack on Ukraine before the House of Commons Thursday and moved to freeze assets of Russian banks. He announced the ""largest ever"" set of sanctions against Russia and vowed to eliminate Europe's reliance on Russian oil and gas.

Anti-Russian demonstrations have popped up across Europe and in the U.S. in cities including New York, London, Dublin, Edinburgh, Paris and Berlin. Meanwhile, Russian authorities began cracking down on anti-war protests across the country, reportedly arresting more than a thousand demonstrators in several cities.

Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the country severed diplomatic relations with Russia and called ""on all our partners to do the same. By this concrete step you will demonstrate that you stand by Ukraine and categorically reject the most blatant act of aggression in Europe since WWII.""

While the attack on Ukraine was largely condemned by the West, it’s unclear whether forces will intervene, something Russian President Vladimir Putin warned would show grave consequences. NATO is sending additional forces to bolster defenses in eastern Europe.

Oleksiy Arestovich, an adviser to Zelenskyy, said Thursday about 40 people have been killed so far in the Russian attack on the country, The Associated Press reported. Several dozen people have been wounded. He didn’t specify whether casualties included civilians.

Zelenskyy said he would be providing weapons to citizens who want to help defend the country, instructing them on Twitter to ""be ready to support Ukraine in the squares of our cities.""

""Russia treacherously attacked our state in the morning, as Nazi Germany did in #2WW years,"" Zelenskyy tweeted. ""As of today, our countries are on different sides of world history.""

The attacks came first from the air. Later, Ukrainian authorities described ground invasions in multiple regions, and border guards released security camera footage Thursday showing a line of Russian military vehicles crossing into Ukraine’s government-held territory from Russian-annexed Crimea in the south.

In the north, video showed tanks rolling over the border from the Russian ally of Belarus through Senkivka. Russian forces also landed in the port cities of Odessa and Mariupol.

The Russian military claimed to have wiped out Ukraine’s entire air defenses in a matter of hours, and European authorities declared the country's airspace an active conflict zone.

Russia's claims could not immediately be verified, nor could Ukrainian ones that it had shot down several Russian aircraft, according to The Associated Press. The Ukrainian air defense system and air force date back to the Soviet era and are dwarfed by Russia’s massive air power and precision weapons.

Western counties were anticipating hundreds of thousands of people to flee from the attack on Ukraine, Reuters reported. Highways outside of Kyiv swelled with traffic Thursday leading to Poland, and lines of people waited for gasoline, to withdraw money or to purchase other supplies, such as food and water.

Kyiv Mayor Vitaly Klitschko advised residents to stay home unless they are involved in critical work and urged them to prepare go-bags with necessities and documents if they need to evacuate.

Ukraine said columns of Russian troops were passing over the border into the Ukrainian regions of Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Luhansk, Reuters reported. Russian missiles also targeted several Ukrainian cities, and explosions could be heard before dawn in the capital of Kyiv, home to 3 million people.

After weeks of denying plans to invade, Putin justified his actions in an overnight televised address, asserting that the attack was needed to protect civilians in eastern Ukraine — a false claim the U.S. had predicted he would make as a pretext for an invasion. He accused the U.S. and its allies of ignoring Russia’s demands to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO and for security guarantees.

In a reminder of Russia’s nuclear power, Putin said ""no one should have any doubts that a direct attack on our country will lead to the destruction and horrible consequences for any potential aggressor.""

Among Putin’s pledges was to ""denazify"" Ukraine. World War II looms large in Russia, after the Soviet Union suffered more deaths than any country while fighting Adolf Hitler’s forces. Kremlin propaganda sometimes paints Ukrainian nationalists as neo-Nazis seeking revenge — a charge historians call disinformation. Ukraine is now led by a Jewish president who lost relatives in the Holocaust.

Russian invasion: What is NATO's Article 5?,"President Biden on Wednesday met with leaders of NATO nations dubbed the Bucharest 9 (B9) – which flank the eastern front and stand as the first line of defense against Russia – to reaffirm the alliance's commitment to Article 5 and the protections it grants all member nations.

Article 5 of NATO’s Washington Treaty, known as ""the principle of collective defense,"" obliges all member countries to come to the aid of another member whose sovereignty or territorial integrity is under threat.

NATO defines this core principle as ""very heart of NATO’s founding treaty.""

""Collective defense means that an attack against one Ally is considered as an attack against all Allies,"" the NATO charter outlines. ""It remains a unique and enduring principle that binds its members together.""

WHAT VICTORY FOR UKRAINE LOOKS LIKE BEYOND BORDER SECURITY: CHIEF DEFENSE ADVISER

The war in Ukraine has dragged on for nearly a year, far outstripping what Russian President Vladimir Putin thought of Ukraine's defenses or NATO's ability to remain a united front.

However, it has also increased concerns regarding what the threat of a prolonged war means for European security and whether the conflict could spill over into NATO territory.

""As NATO's eastern flank, you're on the front lines of our collective defense,"" Biden said to B9 leaders. ""And you know better than anyone what's at stake in this conflict, not just for Ukraine, but for the freedom of democracies throughout Europe and around the world.

""I've said it to you many times, I'll say it again [so its] absolutely clear. Article 5 is a sacred commitment the United States has made. We will defend literally every inch of NATO. Every inch,"" he added.

However, Ukraine is not a NATO member country.

While Ukraine has contributed to NATO operations and missions in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo, Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere, this is not enough to warrant the full protection of all NATO nations.

While NATO has pledged to back Ukraine with defensive aid to win the war against Russia, it has stopped short of sending in boots on the ground – a stipulation only afforded to the 30-member nations.

Ukrainian President Volodmyr Zelenskyy said Kyiv had applied to become a member of NATO in September, which would serve as a deterrent against future Russian aggression.

Though the NATO charter stipulates that no nation can be fully considered or accepted as a member while it is engaged in conflict.

Putin has claimed that he was prompted to launch his ""special military operation"" into Ukraine over the threat that Kyiv and NATO posed in expanding the alliance – an excuse Western officials have flatly rejected.

RUSSIA DECRIES UKRAINE'S CALLS FOR NATO-LIKE SECURITY COALITION AS 'PROLOGUE' TO WWIII

NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg has said it is Ukraine's right to seek membership and has refused Russian attempts to blackball Kyiv from being able to join the alliance.

Biden on Wednesday was not alone is his steadfast commitment not only to NATO, but to Ukraine during the Wednesday meeting.

Romania President Klaus Iohannis, who helped establish the B9 in 2015 in wake of Russia's aggression in Eastern Europe following the 2014 invasion of Ukraine and subsequent illegal annexation of Crimea, echoed Biden's commitments.

""We…the leaders of the eastern flank have the duty to stand firm in defense of our peace. We must continue to stand firm in delivering on our commitments to support Ukraine for as long as it needs to win this war,"" he said. ""This is what Romania will continue to do.

""We are not alone in this endeavor,"" he added.

The meeting of the NATO leaders came not only as the war nears the one-year anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but followed the pronouncement by Secretary of State Antony Blinken at the Munich Security Conference over the weekend, when he said the U.S. is concerned that Moscow is now turning to China for lethal aid.

Security officials are greatly concerned by the threat China's participation in the war would bring as it would not only change the dynamic on the battlefield in Ukraine but would force European nations to cut economic ties and further strain relations between China and the West.

This geopolitical divide between democracies and autocracies would create its own challenges, particularly as it relates to security concerns over Taiwan.

China has denied it is considering aiding Russia in its war effort, though Moscow received Beijing's top diplomat Tuesday for discussions on the war.

""We must break the cycle of Russian aggression,"" Stoltenberg warned. ""We don't know when the war will end, but when it does, we need to ensure that history does not repeat itself.

Russian oil executive who criticized Ukraine invasion dead after reportedly falling out of hospital window,"The chairman of Russian oil giant Lukoil, who along with his company had criticized the Ukraine invasion, reportedly died Thursday after falling from the sixth-floor window of a hospital in Moscow.

Ravil Maganov died in what sources are calling a possible suicide after his body was found on the ground of Moscow's elite Central Clinical Hospital, according to Russian news reports.

A statement from Lukoil said Maganov ""passed away after a severe illness,"" but did not give any further information.

Citing an unnamed law enforcement source, state news agency Tass reported that Maganov committed suicide after having been admitted to the hospital following a heart attack. News outlet RBK also reported that police were investigating the chairman's death as a possible suicide.

When Russia invaded Ukraine, the board of Lukoil was one of few companies that urged for a swift end to the armed conflict, calling it a ""tragedy"" and expressing sympathy for its victims.

PUTIN CRITIC LIVING IN EXILE FOUND DEAD OUTSIDE UPSCALE DC APARTMENT AFTER POLICE RESPONSE TO ‘JUMPER’ CALL

Former Defense Intelligence Agency officer Rebekah Koffler, author of the book ""Putin's Playbook,"" told Fox News Digital that ""we will never know exactly what happened to Maganov,"" but noted that death by defenestration is ""standard Russian intelligence playbook"" regarding the doctrine of ""wet affairs,"" the translation of a Russian term referring to operations that spill blood.

""The ‘wet affairs’ are targeted assassinations,"" Koffler said. ""Russia and previously the former Soviet Union are known for orchestrating mysterious deaths of the Kremlin’s opponents. It’s done in various ways — shots in the back of the head, poisonings, forced suicides and other intricate forms of violent death. I have a whole section in my book describing this doctrine and with examples of high-profile cases.""

PUTIN FURIOUS OVER US 'HEGEMONY,' SAYS END OF 'UNIPOLAR WORLD ORDER' IS ON THE HORIZON

Explaining that the Russian news agencies are mostly controlled or at least influenced by the Russian government, Koffler noted that Russian media ""couldn’t keep its story straight today on what happened to Maganov.""

""Interfax said he died, having fallen out of a window and Tass wrote that it was suicide. Yet another paper speculated that he was trying to go out of a balcony to get a smoke. The truth is these tactics are designed deliberately to be stealthy, so no investigator could identify foul play. They are usually deemed ‘tragic accidents.’ Also part of the doctrine,"" she said.

Maganov's death follows a similar mysterious death in August, when Soviet-born businessman and Putin critic Dan Rapoport reportedly jumped to his death from his upscale Washington, D.C., apartment. Like Maganov, Rapoport had publicly criticized the Russian invasion of Ukraine. A former top manager of Lukoil was found dead in the basement of a residence in a Moscow suburb in May.

The pilot ejected from the plane before it crashed, but officials say he suffered injuries and died, according to Russian media.

""A plane of the Ministry of Defense crashed in the Valuysky urban district. Now an investigation team and officials of the Ministry of Emergency Situations are working on the spot,"" Gladkov said in a statement.

The incident came on the eve of the one-year anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which lands on Thursday. Ukrainian officials have warned for months that Russian forces plan to renew their offensive sometime around the anniversary.

Ukrainian defense officials also warned of a potential massive missile attack that could land on the anniversary or in the days following.

""Yes, it will be tough, and we have to be ready for it. We must maintain maximum calm,"" Oleksiy Danilov, the head of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, told Ukrainian TV last week, according to The Wall Street Journal.

U.S. defense officials have agreed with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's warnings, saying it is likely Putin will try an offensive in an effort to turn the tables after months of Ukraine regaining territory.

""The situation on the front line is complicated,"" Zelenskyy said in a sit-down interview with Fox News’ Trey Yingst earlier in February. ""Russia is preparing for the rematch. We can feel this. I believe that it has already started or not fully. We will see that in the nearest weeks.""

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine puts Taiwan on high alert over mainland China threat,"Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has sent jitters across Taiwan, as military strategists and lawmakers prepare for the possibility – however far-reaching – of a similar invasion from mainland China.

Last month, as Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine, nine Chinese aircraft entered Taiwan’s air defense zone, prompting a broadcast warning from the island nation.

Military strategists in Taiwan are closely studying Ukrainians as they've mounted a fierce resistance against a more formidable opponent despite being outgunned and outmanned.

RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES

According to some estimates, China spends more than $250 billion on its annual military budget, while Taiwan spends around $13 billion.

Still, the setback for Russia has been encouraging to many in Taiwan. Taiwanese lawmaker Lin Chu-Yin told Bloomberg this week that ""Putin’s war sends a signal to China that it won’t be as easy to take Taiwan as it imagines.""

""And it also breaks the myth that one can easily defeat another smaller or militarily weaker country with missiles,"" he said.

Meanwhile, Ma Cheng-Kun, director of the Graduate Institute of China Military Affairs Studies at Taiwan’s National Defense University told Reuters this week that Taiwan’s military has been developing mobile weapons similar to the ones used by Ukraine to push back Russian forces.

""From Ukraine’s performance, we can be even more confident in our own,"" Ma said.

Taiwan said it planned to double its yearly missile production capacity to close to 500 this year. The announcement from the defense ministry came after Taiwan approved an extra $8.6 billion for military spending over the next five years.

CHINESE AMBASSADOR WARNS OF ‘MILITARY CONFLICT’ WITH US OVER TAIWAN

Tensions were mounting between China and Taiwan well before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. China has for decades regarded Taiwan as a renegade breakaway state.

Taiwan and China split in 1949 and China has been increasing pressure on the self-ruled nation, while opposing its involvement in international organizations. The U.S. does not formally recognize Taiwan but maintains an unofficial alliance.

The U.S. and its western allies have imposed crippling sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, targeting the country's banking and financial sectors. However, it's unclear how far these countries would be willing to go against China, given that it plays a more dominant role in the global economy.

Many leaders in Taiwan have also questioned how committed the U.S. would be if a conflict with Beijing were to escalate.

""If the world does not defend Taiwan, the whole order of things – especially in the Pacific – starts to change,"" retired CSM former Green Beret George Fraser told Fox News. ""After Afghanistan and Ukraine, what country would trust an alliance with the U.S. or any other western nation. China would rise as the strategic power in the region and be on its way to supplanting the U.S. in its position as a global leader.""

Still, others believe Beijing may be more apprehensive about any moves against Taiwan in the near future, given the chaotic effects of Russia's military aggression. The war has rattled stock markets and pushed gas prices to unprecedented levels.

Beijing has refused to condemn Russia for the invasion, despite growing pressure from the U.S. and the European Union to use its influence to rein Moscow in.

"Russia's major offensive planned by one-year anniversary of invasion, top security official warns","Russia is planning a major offensive against Kyiv by the one-year anniversary of its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council Oleksiy Danilov told Radio Free Europe Friday.

""Now they are preparing for maximum activation, taking into account the fact that these are people from the ‘scoop’, and they believe that by the anniversary they should have some achievements. It is no secret that they are preparing for a new wave by February 24,"" Danilov said.

UKRAINE'S ZELENSKYY HONORS HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL DAY, AUSCHWITZ LIBERATION: 'INDIFFERENCE KILLS'

Ukraine and Western defense officials have repeatedly warned that Russia is planning a wave offensive in an attempt to turn the tide in the war.

But details surrounding the looming offensive have remained unclear.

Danilov reportedly said that first Russia will look to secure the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, where the most brutal warfare continues to take place in an area known as the Donbas.

According to the National Security official, Russia has also been scouting Ukraine's defense capabilities in the Zaporizhzhia region, parts of which have been retaken by Ukrainian forces.

""And now there is a certain accumulation of troops. We know this, we understand what is happening in the Russian Federation in this regard,"" Danilov said.

The U.S. and Germany agreed to send Ukraine urgently needed tanks for its troops on the front lines – opening the way for other nations like Poland to send their own German-made Leopard 2 tanks from its stockpiles.

RUSSIA REACTS TO US, GERMANY TANK DELIVERIES TO UKRAINE: 'DIRECT INVOLVEMENT IN THE CONFLICT'

Though the U.S.’s agreement to send Abrams M1 tanks was made with the understanding that it will take several months to get Ukrainian troops trained up on the sophisticated equipment, concerns remain high that Europe’s tanks contribution could also take too long.

Poland on Friday announced it would send 60 tanks in addition to Germany’s pledge to send 88 tanks, though Berlin said that just 14 – one company’s worth – would be initially sent over.

Warsaw said it would also send 14 of its Leopard 2 tanks along with 30 of its PT-91 Polish-made battle tanks, which first entered the service in the 90s, reported Reuters.

But despite Poland’s immediate proximity to Ukraine, the shipment of tanks is still expected to take three months before Warsaw’s supply of Leopard tanks hits Ukraine’s battlefield – well beyond the looming anniversary less than a month away.

Taiwan boasts of powerful anti-aircraft weaponry amid fears of Chinese invasion,"Taiwanese military personnel showed confidence in the face of a potential Chinese invasion, demonstrating some of the contested island's most powerful anti-aircraft weapons to the media.

""Our regular training is prepared for all-day, 24-hours, missile operations,"" a member of Taiwan's military told a group of reporters Wednesday. ""When the Chinese military acted, we were already well-prepared…. We were not nervous at all.""

The comments came during a demonstration of some of the island's most formidable defensive weaponry on Taiwan's Matsu islands, a chain situated just over six miles from China's coast. Despite the military's confidence in the face of the recent escalation of tensions in the region, many locals on the island fear it would become the front line if a Chinese invasion ever came to fruition.

""I don't feel particularly safe - after all this island, Dongyin, would be the front line of the battlefield,"" Dora Liu, a resident of the island, told Reuters. ""A small island like ours could be taken down in a moment… If there is a war, there would be no place to hide. No matter how many tunnels we have, if they really occupied us, there would be no use in having tunnels.""

CHINA SANCTIONS TAIWANESE POLITICIANS AFTER US LAWMAKER VISITS

Such fears have suddenly seemed more real in the aftermath of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's recent trip to Taiwan, a visit that China viewed as an escalation. Beijing considers the self-governing island part of its own territory.

China responded by running a series of large military exercises in the Taiwan Strait aimed at showing its ability to strike at a moment's notice, a situation that only continued to escalate after five more U.S. lawmakers made a trip to Taiwan less than two weeks after Pelosi.

The Matsu islands represent a potential initial target in a Chinese invasion, having been the site of shellings during a time of amplified tensions in the 1950s and 1960s. While the islands are now home to a thriving tourism industry, locals are increasingly cognizant of their vulnerability.

""I think a war is possible,"" Chien Chun-te, who owns a restaurant on Nangan Island, told Reuters. ""But I hope people in the two countries, and also both the governments, can communicate more. Having no communication would only lead to hatred.""

But like the military, some Taiwanese citizens take a more defiant approach. Huang Tzu-chuan, who spent a month working on the islands, drew parallels to Russia's invasion of Ukraine earlier this year.

""We feel our relationship between Taiwan and China is just the same as theirs,"" Huang told Reuters.

A Chinese invasion, like the Russian invasion, would force the Taiwanese to defend their country.

Foreign Minister Joseph Wu told reporters in Taipei that Taiwan will not be intimidated by China’s aggression but said, ""China has used the drills in its military play-book to prepare for the invasion of Taiwan.""

""It is conducting large-scale military exercises and missile launches, as well as cyber-attacks, disinformation, and economic coercion, in an attempt to weaken public morale in Taiwan,"" first reported Reuters. ""After the drills conclude, China may try to routinize its action in an attempt to wreck the long-term status quo across the Taiwan Strait.""

Wu did not offer up a timeline on when Taipei thinks Beijing could officially order troops to invade the island, though some reporting has suggested it could happen by 2024 as China and the U.S. prepare for elections.

However, the Pentagon does not agree with this assessment, and Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Dr. Colin Kahl told reporters Monday that Beijing is ""trying to coerce the international community.""

""We're not going to take the bait, and it's not going to work. It's a manufactured crisis that that doesn't mean we have to play into that,"" he added. ""What we'll do instead is to continue to fly, to sail and to operate wherever international law allows us to do so.""

U.S. officials, including high-ranking members of President Biden's cabinet, have acknowledged the legitimacy of China's threats to Taiwan.

Japan, an ally of both Taiwan and the United States in East Asia, has voiced its own concerns.

Japanese Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi said the missiles ""threatened Japan’s national security and the lives of the Japanese people, which we strongly condemn.""

The problem in Japan is compounded by the island nation's lack of a formal standing military, which is outlawed by its constitution. Japan maintains a small ""defense force"" for protection.

China often threatens to annex Taiwan by force, if necessary, while Japan and the U.S. continue to increase their military readiness to potentially respond to such an attack.

Turkey inches closer to invasion of northern Syria as Islamic State terror threat grows,"There is significant concern that Turkey’s planned ground invasion into Syria to root out the U.S.-allied Kurds could open the floodgates for the release of thousands of imprisoned Islamic State terrorists.

Syrian Kurdish forces have incarcerated thousands of ISIS terrorists from more than 50 countries in prisons in northeastern Syrian.

Brigadier Gen. Patrick Ryder, the Pentagon’s press secretary, said Wednesday, ""Recent air strikes in Syria directly threatened the safety of U.S. personnel who are working in Syria with local partners to defeat ISIS and maintain custody of more than 10,000 ISIS detainees.""

CENTCOM CHIEF BELIEVES SYRIA IS 'BREEDING GROUND' FOR NEXT GENERATION OF ISIS

Turkey recently launched air strikes targeting the Syrian Kurdish military organization—The People’s Defense Units (YPG) in Syria and the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) in Iraq.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan declared, ""This is not limited to just an air campaign,"" adding, ""We will consult with our defense ministry and general staff and decide together to which our land forces needs to contribute, then take our steps accordingly."" Earlier, Turkey's defense minister was quoted by the country's media as saying the operation continues with some 326 enemy combatants killed so far.

Combating a resurgence of the terrorist movement Islamic State remains a top priority for the U.S. military. The U.S. formed an alliance with the YPG to oust ISIS, while conflict between Erdogan and the Kurdish forces in Syria may be moving from a localized conflict to a full-blown war.

Ryder noted that an ""Immediate de-escalation is necessary to maintain focus on the defeat-ISIS mission and ensure the safety and security of personnel on the ground committed to the defeat-ISIS mission.""

Turkish Embassy officials in Washington told Fox News Digital, ""We have time and again pointed out threats against our national security, posed by the PKK/YPG terrorist network in Syria and Iraq. We have always called for unequivocal and genuine solidarity in the face of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.""

The Turkish diplomat added, ""Notwithstanding, the terrorist organization continued its attacks, recently targeting innocent civilians in the heart of Istanbul. As a result of the attack perpetrated on Nov. 13, 2022, six civilians were killed and 81 injured.""

The U.S. government has classified the PKK as a terrorist organization, but views the YPG as valuable partner in the fight against the Islamic State.

U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price recently said, ""We express our sincere condolences for the loss of civilian life that has occurred in Syria and Turkey"" and urged an ""immediate de-escalation.""

Intensive Turkish air and drone strikes have killed Syrian Kurds and pulverized critical industries in northern Syria, Sinam Mohamad, the representative of the Syrian Democratic Council to the U.S., told Fox News Digital.

Mohamad said the region’s Arabs, Christians and Kurds, who make up the area’s five million people, are ""suffering.""

SYRIAN KURDISH FORCES MOVE IN ON ISLAMIC STATE-CONTROLLED PRISON

She added Turkey has bombed the region 47 times from Nov. 19-23, and the air strikes killed six soldiers from the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), including two anti-terror soldiers trained by the U.S. military.

Mohamad, who is in contact with Syrians on the ground in the conflict zone, said Turkish forces have killed 15 civilians since the start of this round of air strikes: ""Turkey is now targeting vital infrastructures, power stations, grain silos, and oil and gas infrastructures.""

She claimed the Turks attacked a hospital and they ""targeted very close to an ISIS prison. Imagine if they targeted the prison, and the people escaped. It is a very critical situation. The international community and U.N. should take action to prevent Turkey from destabilizing the region.""

A leading expert on Turkey, Hay Eytan Cohen Yanarocak, from the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security, cast significant doubt on Turkey’s rationalization for launching its most recent attacks.

""The latest terror attack against Istanbul was carried about by Syrian forces who were dissatisfied with Turkey’s U-turn because Turkey signaled it was willing to normalize relations with [Syrian President] Bashar al-Assad,"" he told Fox News Digital.

He added, ""Erdogan knows very well that it would be a lot easier to punish the Kurds instead of punishing Syrians. We know the Free Syrian Army is considered an ally of Turkey. If the Free Syrian Army was tagged as responsible [for the terror attack in Istanbul], his foreign policy doctrine would collapse.""

TURKISH OFFICIAL ACCUSES US OF COMPLICITY IN DEADLY BOMBING: 'THE KILLER IS AMONG THE FIRST ONES RETURNING'

The pro-Kurdish party, The People’s Democratic Party, in the Turkish parliament submitted a motion requesting an inquiry into the Istanbul attack. Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party along with his ally, the Nationalist Movement Party, rejected the investigation.

All Kurdish military forces in Syria, as well as the PKK, have flatly denied responsibility for the Istanbul terrorism attack. The commander of the SDF, Gen. Mazloum Abdi, speaking exclusively to Fox News’ Jennifer Griffin, claimed the Istanbul bomber was from the Islamic State.

Turkey has captured a Syrian Arab woman who Turkish authorities said confessed to the bombing. Erdogan has faced accusations of showing sympathy for radical Islamists operating in northern Syria.

Uzay Bulut, a Turkish political analyst and research fellow for the Philos Project, told Fox News Digital, ""If Kobane falls to Turkey, Turkey will occupy it alongside jihadists organizations, as they also do in other Syrian cities such as Idlib and Afrin. Naturally, these Turkish military attacks against the SDF will weaken the counter ISIS campaign in the region.""

According to Bulut, ""The Turkish regime must be fully aware of that such an occupation only helps ISIS and al-Qaeda affiliated terror groups in the region.""

A Turkish official rebuffed such an argument and told Fox News Digital, ""We are the only NATO ally that has boots on the ground and fought DAESH [Islamic State] chest-to-chest since the outset.""

"Turkey planning to launch ground invasion of Syria, targeting Kurds and putting US troops at risk","EXCLUSIVE – A Kurdish general told Fox News that NATO ally Turkey is planning to carry out a massive ground invasion into Syria, targeting the very same Kurdish groups the US military has partnered with and relied on to fight ISIS in Northeast Syria.

The attack could put nearly 1,000 U.S. troops stationed in Syria in harm’s way.

In an exclusive interview with Fox News, the top General for the Kurdish-led Syrian Defense Forces, General Mazloum Abdi, said his forces would no longer be able to help the U.S. fight ISIS because they are facing Turkish attacks.

""We did not freeze the joint actions against ISIS alongside the international coalition on purpose,"" Gen. Mazloum said through an interpreter. ""But as I say, we had to stop this action as we go because we are under tremendous stress of a possible Turkish incursion into our areas.""

Turkish mortars, airstrikes and drones began targeting Kurdish positions in Syria and Iraq in the wake of a November 13th terror bombing in Istanbul, which Turkey blamed on Kurdish groups.

Gen. Mazloum said the bomber was from ISIS and condemned the attack. He warned Turkey is using it as a pretense to ethnically cleanse the Kurds. Turkish warplanes struck a military base that the U.S. military shares with these Kurdish fighters outside Qamishli about 30 miles from Turkey's border.

The US has relied on the SDF to do the ground fighting against ISIS and for intelligence to target ISIS leaders like Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi.

In a strongly worded statement Wednesday the Pentagon said it is ""deeply concerned"" by the escalation which threatens efforts to defeat ISIS and endangers the lives of U.S. personnel who are working in Syria with local partners to defeat the terrorist group.

""Immediate de-escalation is necessary in order to maintain focus on the defeat-ISIS mission and ensure the safety and security of personnel on the ground committed to the defeat-ISIS mission,"" Brigadier Gen. Patrick S. Ryder, Pentagon Press Secretary told Fox News in a statement.

""Recent air strikes in Syria directly threatened the safety of U.S. personnel who are working in Syria with local partners to defeat ISIS and maintain custody of more than ten thousand ISIS detainees.""

There are now around 900 US troops on the ground in Syria who do not have the Kurdish partners in the SDF to control ISIS.

US forces were 300 yards from the SDF base in Hasakah, Syria at the time of Turkish airstrike on Tuesday.

Gen. Mazloum called on the American people and the American government to stand up for the Kurds.

""I want the American people to show the same position they showed back in 2019 when we were again under stress from the Turks,"" he said. ""We are again now under threat of being ethnically cleansed here by the Turks.

Turkey announces northern Syria invasion of ground forces; multiple civilians reported dead,"Turkey announced Wednesday that its ground forces invaded northeastern Syria to fight against Kurdish forces just hours after launching an initial assault in the area, as the first reports of deaths emerged.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan launched Operation Peace Spring on Wednesday after President Trump announced the U.S. would withdraw American troops from the area, a move considered by many analysts a blow to the U.S.-backed Kurdish forces there. Erdogan said the mission was to ""neutralize terror threats against Turkey and lead to the establishment of a safe zone, facilitating the return of Syrian refugees to their homes.""

At least seven civilians were killed in Turkish strikes in northeastern Syria since the country launched an assault Wednesday morning, according to activists and a war monitor.

Trump told reporters Wednesday that he would do ""far more than sanctions"" against Turkey if the country didn't act in the most ""humane way as possible,"" and that he hoped Erdogan would act rationally. When asked what would happen if Erdogan wiped out the Kurds, Trump threatened to ""wipe out"" Turkey's economy, saying he'd done it once before.

TRUMP CALLS TURKEY ASSAULT ON SYRIA A 'BAD IDEA' AS KURDS REPORT CIVILIAN DEATHS

Kurdish forces in northeastern Syria were guarding thousands of captured Islamic State (ISIS) fighters with the help of the U.S. in the area.

The president said the captured terrorists were ""really bad people who should go back to Europe.""

Earlier Wednesday, Trump warned Turkey that its initial assault was a ""bad idea.""

""The United States does not endorse this attack and has made it clear to Turkey that this operation is a bad idea,"" Trump said in a White House statement. ""Turkey has committed to protecting civilians, protecting religious minorities, including Christians, and ensuring no humanitarian crisis takes place -- and we will hold them to this commitment.""

A spokesperson for the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces said Wednesday that Turkish forces ""started to carry out airstrikes on civilian areas"" and caused a ""huge panic among people of the region.""

U.S. military officials told Fox News the president ordered the U.S. military not to get involved in the strikes, after the Kurds requested air support from American forces.

A group of Turkish forces first entered northeastern Syria on Wednesday morning near Tal Abyad and Ras al-Ayn, Bloomberg had reported. Artillery units later shelled suspected Syrian Kurdish targets in Tal Abayd, while two mortar shells hit the Turkish border town of Ceylanpinar, according to Turkey's state-run Anadolu news agency.

""We said to various countries, we'd like you to take your people back. Nobody wants them, they're bad,"" Trump said, adding that ""maybe the Kurds [...] if not them, Turkey"" would deal with the ISIS fighters.

If the fighters escape, they would ""go back to Europe,"" according to the president.

Trump said the situation was ""not a fair deal"" for the U.S., and that going into the Middle East was the ""worst mistake the U.S. has ever made.""

""We're doing jobs that [Europe, Russia, Iran, Iraq, Turkey, Syria] should be doing. [...] We're 7,000 miles away,"" he said.

President Trump announced Sunday the U.S. would pull American troops out of northern Syria, a move leaving the U.S.-backed Kurdish forces -- longtime allies in the fight against ISIS in Syria -- in peril. Ankara has considered the Syrian Kurdish forces to be terrorists allied with a Kurdish insurgency within Turkey.

"Turkey's pending Syria invasion motivated by politics, not security concerns, experts say","Turkey’s impending invasion of northern Syria likely results from ""political reasons"" rather than a national security need, and it remains unclear how officials will declare ""mission success,"" experts told Fox News Digital.

""This is a politically motivated military incursion rather than a sort of, you know, tactically sound or, you know, strategically oriented ambition,"" Sinan Ciddi, an expert on Turkish domestic politics and foreign policy for the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said. ""The timing of this operation will have been much closer to the upcoming Turkish presidential election, so they can reap maximum political benefit out of it.""

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan last week ordered a series of airstrikes against Kurdish militias in northern Syria and vowed to order a land invasion of the territory as tensions surrounding border disputes peaked.

Turkey launched the attacks in response to a deadly bombing on Nov. 13 in Istanbul. Authorities arrested a woman of Arab-Syrian background whom they linked to the People’s Defense Units (YPG) and the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK). The militias denied any involvement, but that did not stop Erdogan from authorizing a military response.

FINLAND MUST LIFT ARMS EMBARGO ON TURKEY IN ORDER TO JOIN NATO, ACCORDING TO TURKISH FOREIGN MINISTER

The Pentagon urged Turkey to stand down on its plan to invade Syria as U.S. officials warned that the operation could endanger U.S. troops in the country.

A spokesperson for the Turkish Embassy in Washington, D.C., told Fox News Digital that officials have ""time and again pointed out threats against our national security, posed by the PKK/YPG terrorist network in Syria and Iraq.""

""We have always called for unequivocal and genuine solidarity in the face of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations,"" the spokesperson said. ""Notwithstanding, the terrorist organization continued its attacks, recently targeting innocent civilians in the heart of Istanbul.""

The spokesman pointed to Turkey’s commitment to help fight DAESH – the Arabic name for ISIS – and is ""the only NATO ally that has put boots on the ground and fought DAESH chest-to-chest since the outset,"" even though U.S. officials have warned that the invasion could lead to the release of detained ISIS members.

Sinam Sherkany Mohamad, the representative of the Syrian Democratic Council mission in the U.S., said that democratic forces – located in northern and eastern Syria – remain prepared for the invasion but ""hope it will not happen.""

""We don't want war, we don't want to create another conflict zone in the region,"" Mohamad said. ""We already, as Syria, suffered a lot [in] 12 years from the Syrian crisis, so we don't want to create another conflict zone or a war in the region that is not in the interest of anyone, neither the United States nor Syrian nor Turkey.""

TURKISH MILITARY VEHICLE RUNS OVER WOMAN AND CHILD IN SYRIA, SPARKING PROTESTS

""We hope that the international community and the main powers, like Russia and the United States, could stop us from [facing] any ground invasion in the coming [days and weeks],"" she added.

Mohamad praised the U.S. efforts to pressure Turkey to prevent the invasion from happening, echoing concerns for U.S. troop safety, and she urged U.S. officials to consider sanctions against Turkey should Erdogan authorize the invasion.

""There are many mechanisms that the U.S. administration can do to prevent Turkey from this ground invasion,"" she said, stressing that any invasion would result in a ""humanitarian catastrophe"" with millions of displaced people.

Erdogan previously suggested the establishment of a ""safe zone"" for refugees in northern Syria, and on Nov. 25 he vowed to follow through on his plan after carrying out the airstrikes. He raised the issue during a call on Sunday with Russian President Vladimir Putin, underscoring the ""importance and urgency"" of creating a ""security corridor"" between the two countries through Syria, and the Kremlin said the Russian and Turkish defense and foreign ministries would maintain ""close contacts.""

During a televised speech last week, Erdogan said that a ""security zone"" would protect ""the rights of millions of women and children"" and his government would work to ""complete this [zone] along the border from the west to the east as soon as possible.""

But while Turkey can tout its need for a ""safe zone,"" experts argue that Erdogan’s goal is purely political, aimed at distracting Turks from the economic problems facing the country.

IRAN, TURKEY BLAME KURDS FOR DOMESTIC PROBLEMS AND PROTESTS TO JUSTIFY INVASION, AIR BOMBINGS: EXPERT

""I would say this is an operation … essentially [aims to] divert public attention in Turkey away from the state of the ailing economy and people's anger towards an external sort of manufactured crisis following the terrorist attack that occurred in Istanbul back in mid-November,"" Ciddi explained, clarifying that while the bombing is real, Erdogan’s government has not provided ""any credible information"" to link the Kurdish militias to the attack.

""Why just accuse the YPG without any credible or substantial or solid information? Because that's an easy go to the Kurdish issue,"" Ciddi said. ""Blaming Kurds is one thing to get the nationalist sort of base and rally around the flag of angst going on in Turkey simply because Erdogan is up against a wall, essentially, electorally speaking.""

Soner Cagaptay, director of Turkish Research Program at the Washington Institute, explained that military action will align with the goal of creating a ""safe zone"" as Erdogan will aim to capture more YPG areas and ""break this into more pieces.""

""Turkey, through foreign incursions in the last five years, has broken this entity up into multiple pieces, and now it wants to do another incursion to break, create another incision,"" Cagaptay said.

More important may be Erdogan’s relationship with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad: Turkey has backed Syrian rebels that Assad has driven back across the past decade to their last stronghold in the country’s northwest. Russia and Iran have supported Assad’s regime.

But recent signs indicate that Turkey and Syria have started working toward thawing that icy dynamic. In September, Turkey’s intelligence chief held multiple meetings with his Syrian counterpart as Russia encouraged more cooperation between the two countries.

Cagaptay believes that Erdogan’s action in Syria could play into that equation if Turkey can absorb those parts in return for support and recognition, which would in turn possibly lead to an end to the long-running war in Syria.

""Assad is going to say, ‘What are you going to do for me?’ and Erdogan is going to say, ‘I recognize you, a Syrian sovereign, sorry for everything I have done,’"" Cagaptay said. ""And I think that's how the war is probably going to end in Syria.""

Kemal Kirişci, a nonresident senior fellow in the Center on the United States and Europe's Turkey Project at the Brookings Institution, noted that Erdogan sits in a precarious position as his intentions and loyalties remain unclear.

""[Erdogan is] playing around with becoming a member of the Shanghai [Cooperation], and then he's giving Greece a hard time, etc.,"" Kirişci said. ""On the surface of it, it looks like he wants to take Turkey away from the West … ideologically, this is what his preference is.""

""Erdogan is very conscious that he cannot afford to be on its own facing the Russian bear,"" he added. ""And he's also extremely aware that he has become too dependent on Putin and Russia.""

"UK Home secretary faces blowback, calls to step down after calling migrant crisis an 'invasion'","British Home Secretary Suella Braverman warned this week that the migrant crisis in the United Kingdom has reached the level of an ""invasion,"" which drew both criticism and support from local politicians, with some calling for her resignation.

""The British people deserve to know which party is serious about stopping the invasion on our southern coast and which party is not,"" Braverman, a conservative, said this week. ""Let’s stop pretending they are all refugees in distress, the whole country knows that is not true.""

Braverman added that her country’s ""hopelessly lax asylum system"" is ""broken.""

Braverman’s comments drew harsh criticism from liberal politicians, including Kim Johnson, a lawmaker for the main opposition Labour Party, who said Braverman's language would inflame tensions amid the growing immigration crisis along the English Channel.

UK SEES RECORD NUMBER OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS CROSSING ENGLISH CHANNEL, AS DEPORTATION PLAN STALLS

Anne McLaughlin, a Scottish Nationalist Party member of Parliament, said she was ""disgusted, absolutely disgusted to hear a Home secretary deliberately use inflammatory language about vulnerable asylum seekers."" She called the remarks shameful.

""She’s totally unfit to be Home secretary,"" Labor MP Zarah Sultana said, according to The Sun.

Immigration minister Robert Jenrick attempted to clarify Braverman's comment by saying ""you have to choose your words very carefully"" and that he would ""never demonize people coming to this country in pursuit of a better life,"" Sky News reported . However, Jenrick explained that Braverman ""was trying to express"" the severity of the crisis.

""The Home secretary was seeking to express the sheer scale of the challenge that faces the country, with people, including a significant proportion of economic migrants, seeking to make this journey,"" a spokesperson for newly installed U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said, according to the BBC .

Nigel Farage, former leader of the Brexit Party as well as UKIP, defended Braverman on Twitter.

""It’s a word I’ve been using for two years that I’ve been condemned for,"" Farage said in a video message . ""I expect even more pressure to come on the Home secretary. I really hope she stays in post but believe me, the establishment are out to get her because she’s got the guts to say many of these people just are not refugees.""

The number of people making the hazardous journey across one of the world's busiest shipping lanes has risen sharply in recent years, with 40,000 reaching the U.K. so far this year, up from 28,000 in all of 2021 and 8,500 in 2020. Some have predicted the number of migrants crossing into the United Kingdom could pass 60,000 by the end of the year.

UK PLEDGES TO CRACK DOWN ON ‘APPALLING’ WAVE OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION ACROSS ENGLISH CHANNEL

Braverman was reappointed by Sunak last week, six days after she resigned from the same role for breaching ministerial rules by sending a sensitive government document via her personal email.

She has also been accused of failing to listen to legal advice on the prolonged detention of migrants at a processing center and failing to secure adequate accommodation for them, both claims she has denied. She has, so far, ignored calls to resign once again.

Braverman's comments came the day after an immigration center in Dover was targeted with gasoline bombs on Sunday, injuring one person before the suspect reportedly killed himself.

""No Home secretary who was serious about public safety or national security would use highly inflammatory language on the day after a dangerous petrol bomb attack on a Dover initial processing center,"" Yvette Cooper, the home affairs spokeswoman for the opposition Labour Party, said.

THE BRITISH POUND HAS TAKEN A TUMBLE. WHAT'S THE IMPACT?

Braverman is also facing criticism after revealing that ""high numbers"" of migrants could potentially take legal action against the government for being housed at processing centers longer than the law permits, The Sun reported.

Some have attempted to place blame on Braverman for the legal issues, which could mean payouts of up to 6,000 British pounds for each migrant, and alleged that she blocked migrants from being sent to hotels.

Braverman has denied that she ""deliberately"" blocked the transfer of migrants, adding that the criticisms were part of a ""political witch hunt"" that ignores the ""facts of the problem.""

""Illegal immigration is out of control,"" Braverman said.

About a fifth of British voters say dealing with immigration is the most challenging issue facing the country, according to a YouGov poll published this month.

""The number of people arriving in the U.K. via small boats has reached record levels and continues to put our asylum system under incredible pressure,"" a spokesperson for the U.K. Home Office told Fox News Digital. ""Manston remains resourced and equipped to process migrants securely and we will provide alternative accommodation as soon as possible.""

""We urge anyone who is thinking about leaving a safe country and risking their lives at the hands of criminal people smugglers to seriously reconsider,"" the statement continued. ""Despite what they have been told, they will not be allowed to start a new life here.""

The Home Office added that it will continue to provide for all the basic needs of migrants who arrive at their processing centers and said they are ""absolutely committed to securing the welfare of all migrants and staff"" at the Manston processing center.

A Russian vehicle capable of carrying thermobaric weaponry was spotted traveling in Ukraine, CNN reported, but there is no official determination that such a weapon was used.

"Ukraine invasion: Russian conscripts reportedly forced to sign military contracts, losing contact with family","Parents of Russian conscripts who say they've lost communications with their loved ones are pleading with Kremlin officials for answers as to where family members have been sent amid concerns they have been forced to sign contracts to fight as part of President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine, according to the report.

Olga Larkina, the director of Russia’s Committee of Soldiers’ Mothers, spoke to Russian investigative news outlet Meduza, describing how Russian conscripts – those fulfilling military enlistment requirements – had been pressured, or at times even forced to sign contracts to become soldiers for the Russian military.

""Mothers are telling us that their sons have been calling them and saying they’re being forced to sign contracts. We believe it’s wrong to force a conscript to become a contract soldier,"" Larkina said, according to the translated article. ""The parents who have gotten in touch have told us their sons were just taken by military officers, stamped, and that’s it — now they’re contract soldiers.""

RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES

Russian law is said to dictate that a conscript interested in signing a contract could do so after three months. The process to transfer a soldier from conscripted to contract service reportedly takes months in most cases, but officials are said to be skipping steps.

Those contracted soldiers were then sent to parts of Ukraine as part of the Kremlin’s invasion efforts, and families have since lost communication with them, the report claimed.

Larkina said she did not know how the soldiers were being forced to sign the contracts.

""I’m panicking — where is my child? I’ve tried calling every phone he’s ever called me from and they’re all turned off. My child said that even the captains’ phones were confiscated,"" a mother identified using the alias ""Alyona"" told Meduza. ""I feel awful, I need for the children not to be there, for the children to be [back in] the places where they were drafted, not in this hell.""

Larkina said the Committee of Soldiers’ Mothers had since reached out to the Russian Defense Ministry, the Military Prosecutor’s office and military leadership about whether conscripts were forced to sign the contracts. She said they never got a straight answer, according to the report.

""They said we would need to call the commanding officer at the military unit where the situation was occurring, that all responsibility for personnel lies with the unit’s commanding officer, but getting in touch with the commanding officer is impossible,"" Larkina said.

Russian President Vladimir Putin sent troops into Ukraine after he spent weeks denying that's what he intended, all the while building up a force of almost 200,000 troops along the countries' borders.

Putin claimed the West has failed to take seriously Russia's security concerns about NATO, the Western military alliance that Ukraine aspired to join. But, he also has expressed scorn about Ukraine's right to exist as an independent state.

Putin has not disclosed his ultimate plans for Ukraine, but Western officials said he appeared determined to overthrow Ukraine’s government and replace it with a regime of his own, redrawing the map of Europe and reviving Moscow’s Cold War-era influence.

It was unclear in the fog of war how much territory Russian forces have seized. Britain’s Ministry of Defense said, ""the speed of the Russian advance has temporarily slowed likely as a result of acute logistical difficulties and strong Ukrainian resistance.""

A senior U.S. defense official said Saturday that more than half of the Russian combat power that was massed along Ukraine’s borders had entered Ukraine, and that Russia has had to commit more fuel supply and other support units inside Ukraine than originally anticipated.

Ukraine’s health minister reported Saturday that 198 people, including three children, had been killed and more than 1,000 others had been wounded during what has become Europe’s largest land war since World War II. It was unclear whether those figures included both military and civilian casualties.

"Ukraine 'more united than before' Russian invasion, journalism student says","Elina Konavalyuk and her family had a relaxed if not indifferent attitude towards Russia before all this. Some family members had even felt a bit nostalgic for the USSR over the years. But no more. Not after living under attack by Russian soldiers who occupied the Kherson region of Ukraine early in the war, sleeping months, frightened, in a basement and Konavalyuk, her mother and grandparents finally making a dangerous escape from their homeland.

""It was a fight for survival,"" she said about living under Russian occupation last winter, something she had never imagined could happen to her or anyone she knew. The port city of Kherson, just north of Crimea, was the first major city to fall to the Russians in their 2022 war. ""I don’t have that adrenaline right now. Then all my thoughts were just about standing in line for six hours for a slice of bread. You would see your neighbors’ corpses lying outside your house. It was both mentally and physically so hard because you needed to acquire new skills just to survive.""

UKRAINE HAS 'ACCELERATED' NATO APPLICATION IN WAKE OF RUSSIA ANNEXING TERRITORIES, ZELENSKYY SAYS

Last winter and spring, I posted some of what Konavalyuk shared with me during her time underground, never using her name out of fear for her safety. And in fact, she says Russian border guards checked her phone and interrogated her intensely on the way out, suspicious as they are of each fleeing Ukrainian. Her ""Diary of Survival"" memoirs read like poetry with descriptions of what it feels like to forget the smell of fresh laundry and the taste of jam.

Konavalyuk is a journalism student. Documenting what was going on in her hometown and teaching herself what blasts correspond to what sort of weapons fire in order to know when to run, how to react to the constant noise and bombardment all around her, she says, helped her get through the long and terrifying months. Now, in the safety of Europe, she finds it hard sometimes, she says, to see people enjoying the worry-free life of those who are not living in a state of war.

FURTHER TROUBLE IN RUSSIA’S BACKYARD AS RECENT FIGHTING BETWEEN ALLIES CREATES NEW HEADACHE FOR PUTIN

And Friday was a particularly somber day for people like Konavalyuk who hail from the Ukrainian territories Russia just declared its own, annexing Kherson and three other regions that together account for fifteen percent of Ukraine’s territory. The formal annexation followed what has widely been called illegitimate referendums.

""People were forced to vote at gunpoint, rounded up on the street. They came to their homes and threatened them,"" Konavalyuk said. ""So it’s very easy to refute this referendum."" Russian President Vladimir Putin, speaking in the Kremlin’s chandeliered Georgievski Hall whose shining parquet floors seemed in striking contrast to the grim-faced government officials who filled the room, said Russia would never give those territories back. Konavalyuk has a different view, that Ukraine will get its land back, but she says, the ""fact that this will now be considered an attack on Russia complicates things,"" she says. ""It will be more difficult for us to get back the Kherson region and the rest of the occupied territories.""

When I ask who will do the fighting, who will get Kherson back, she says, ""Different Ukrainians from different parts are fighting for Kherson. The most incredible thing for me is that Ukraine is now more united than before. There’s no difference at all right now—if you’re from the South or from the West. In other words, we are united as one people in returning our lands.

Several top officials, including Deputy Defense Minister Vyacheslav Shapovalov and Deputy Prosecutor General Oleksiy Symonenko, resigned in late January amid accusations that inflated prices were paid for the army's food supplies.

The defense ministry has denied the accusations of corruption and said the resignations were done to ensure the public's trust in the ministry.

"Ukraine war upended China's plan to invade Taiwan, alleged FSB whistleblower says","Russia 's invasion of Ukraine upended Chinese President Xi Jinping's timetable to invade Taiwan, according to documents purportedly written by a Russian intelligence analyst in one of Moscow's security agencies.

""Xi Jinping was at least considering taking over Taiwan in the fall - he needs his own little victory to get re-elected for a third term - there the struggle within the elite is colossal,"" an agent in Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), the successor agency to the KGB, allegedly wrote on March 9. China will hold its 20th Communist Party Congress this fall, and Xi has said it will be a ""major event."" Analysts have predicted that Xi will either be re-elected as the general secretary of the Communist Party or be elected to the chairmanship of the party, a position that has not existed since 1982.

RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES

""Now, after the Ukrainian events, this window of opportunity has been closed to him, which gives the United States the opportunity to both blackmail Xi and negotiate with its competitors on favorable terms,"" the FSB agent added. ""It was in this case that we launched a trap mechanism for China with our actions.""

The agent added that the FSB is ""seriously considering"" claiming that ""the battle on Ukrainian territory is a US war against China, in which the Americans simply set us up and used us.""

""The global clash between the US and China was inevitable,"" the agent wrote. ""After the war with Ukraine (although I may avoid using the term ‘operation’ here), the cost of resources in the world, especially energy ones, has gone up. The main victim of such actions becomes China, to which (I can confirm) were given guarantees that everything will end quickly. Therefore, China behaved tolerant in the past. But that was before that.""

""China may well give us a tough ultimatum to end the war to stabilize oil prices,"" the agent predicted. ""If this happens, I don't want to predict anything - it's just on the horizon of disaster events.""

RUSSIAN FAILURES IN UKRAINE LEAVE ‘NO OPTION FOR A POSSIBLE VICTORY,' ALLEGED FSB WHISTLEBLOWER SAYS

Vladimir Osechkin, founder of the Gulagu.net human rights group, published the report on his Facebook page last week. He claimed that the same FSB agent wrote this document and the March 5 report that claimed a Russian victory in Ukraine had become a near impossibility.

Christo Grozev, who works for the Netherlands-based investigative journalism group Bellingcat, tweeted that he showed the March 5 letter to two FSB contacts, one current and one former employee. They had no doubt that the author was a colleague, he said.

As Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine, nine Chinese aircraft entered Taiwan’s air defense zone, prompting a broadcast warning from the island nation.

BIDEN'S ‘BYSTANDER IN CHIEF’ APPROACH TO UKRAINE MAY EMBOLDEN CHINA IN ATTACKING TAIWAN; EXPERT WARNS

China may emerge as the primary beneficiary of the Russia-Ukraine war, Steve Gray, a New Jersey congressional candidate and former FBI special agent who worked on China and North Korea, told Fox News Digital earlier this month. Gray warned that China has ""been given a case study of what the world's response would look like if they were to invade Taiwan.""

Russian President Vladimir Putin considers Ukraine a part of historic Russia, and Xi considers Taiwan a part of China. Yet, as the FSB agent suggested, this very similarity may provide reasons for China to rethink a potential invasion of Taiwan. The Ukrainian people's resolve against Russia has reportedly stalled the Kremlin's timeline for the war, and peace talks are ongoing.

Ukraine warns Belarus planning 'direct invasion' to assist Putin's forces,"Ukrainian officials warned on Sunday that the Belarusian military was preparing to invade at the onset of the fifth week since Russian President Vladimir Putin’s forces first descended on Ukraine last month.

In a statement shared to Facebook, Ukraine’s Ministry of Defense said there were signs that suggested the armed forces of the Republic of Belarus were preparing for a ""direct invasion"" of Ukrainian territory.

Belarus borders Ukraine to the north and was reportedly used as a staging area for Russian forces.

""The direct involvement of Belarusian troops in the Russian armed aggression against Ukraine, contrary to the will of the military and the vast majority of the Belarusian people, will become a fatal mistake of Alexander Lukashenko,"" the statement said of Putin’s close ally.

The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine assessed that the threat level was high for ""an offensive from the Republic of Belarus in the Volyn direction,"" according to Ukrainian online newspaper Pravda.

This comes after Lukashenko recently bemoaned the fall of the Soviet Union and blamed conflicts in Ukraine and elsewhere on the ""monopolization of our planet by the United States of America,"" according to Reuters. In an interview on Japanese television channel TBS, Lukashenko also described Putin as a friend and defended him against Western leaders questioning his mental and physical fitness.

""He and I haven't only met as heads of state, we're on friendly terms,"" Lukashenko said of Putin. ""I'm absolutely privy to all his details, as far as possible, both state and personal.""

""Putin is absolutely fit, he's in better shape than ever,"" he continued. ""This is a completely sane, healthy person, physically healthy - he's an athlete. As they say here - he'll catch a cold at all our funerals.""

In a break from isolation in recent weeks, Putin on Friday held a pro-war rally in Moscow marking the eighth anniversary of Moscow’s annexation of Crimea. The events came as the invasion of Ukraine has led to heavier-than-expected Russian losses on the battlefield and increasingly authoritarian rule in Russia.

Amid reports of low-morale among the Russian ranks, Ukrainian defense officials claimed Sunday to have obtained documents that indicate Russia has ordered the deployment of young cadets to Ukraine.

Putin has repeatedly told his people that the army is not utilizing cadets, but photos of the documents posted online indicate that Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu has signed an order to the contrary. The deployment will see Yunarmia cadets aged 17 and 18 pushed to the front lines in Ukraine.

Ukraine warns of massive Russian missile attack on anniversary of Putin’s invasion: ‘We have to be ready’,"Ukrainian officials are warning civilians to prepare for a massive barrage of Russian missiles on the anniversary of Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion next week.

Russia fired three dozen missiles toward critical infrastructure across Ukraine on Thursday, but officials say they expect next week's volley to be much larger. Ukraine's air defenses have had some success in shooting down incoming missiles, disabling 16 of the 36 launched Thursday, but a larger barrage is likely to cause severe damage in major cities.

""Yes, it will be tough, and we have to be ready for it. We must maintain maximum calm,"" Oleksiy Danilov, the head of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, told Ukrainian TV on Thursday, according to The Wall Street Journal.

Russia began its current invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022.

RUSSIA WARNS ISRAEL AGAINST PROVIDING ARMS TO UKRAINE: 'WILL LEAD TO AN ESCALATION OF THIS CRISIS'

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has warned for weeks that Russia plans to ramp up its aggression at the one-year mark, though in the past he has referenced a ground offensive.

U.S. defense officials have agreed with Zelenskyy's assessment, saying it is likely Putin will try an offensive in an effort to turn the tables after months of Ukraine regaining territory.

""The situation on the frontline is complicated,"" he said in a sit-down interview with Fox News’ Trey Yingst earlier in February. ""Russia is preparing for the rematch. We can feel this. I believe that it has already started or not fully. We will see that in the nearest weeks.""

Russian troops, including the elite 155th naval infantry, stormed the Ukrainian coal mining city Vuhledar near Dontesk in late January. Ukrainian forces repelled the offensive, however, and killed, injured or captured 5,000 Russian troops. Meanwhile, U.K. officials say the war is exacting a heavy toll on Russia, with 824 Russian troops dying each day, according to Ukrainian updates.

In the video, titled, ""The Year of Invincibility,"" Zelenskyy sat at a desk and spoke directly to the camera, just as he had done so one year ago in a short address announcing that Russian military forces had launched a full-scale war against Ukraine.

""A year ago, on this day, from this very place, at about seven in the morning, I addressed you with a short statement. It lasted only 67 seconds,"" the wartime leader began in a 15-minute address.

""It contained the two most important things, then and now. That Russia started a full-scale war against us. And that we are strong. We are ready for anything. We will defeat everyone. Because we are Ukraine!"" he said.

The somber video comes as Ukrainians and the world reflect on the suffering and death brought by Russia's invasion. Tens of thousands are estimated to have died on the Ukrainian side, both civilian and military, and between 40,000 to 60,000 Russian soldiers have been killed, according to a Ukrainian analysis that was supported by the U.K. government.

Zelenskyy honored the men and women who ""did not raise the white flag, and began to defend the blue and yellow."" Though Russian President Vladimir Putin and many foreign observers expected Russian forces to overwhelm Kyiv within days, Zelenskyy praised the Ukrainian armed forces for defying expectations and furiously defending their homeland for a whole year.

""The world saw what Ukraine is capable of,"" Zelenskyy said.

""It did not fall in three days. It stopped the second army of the world.""

The Ukrainian president also thanked foreign allies in the ""anti-Putin coalition"" and said he would deliver a separate address ""shortly"" on the international effort supporting Ukraine's defense against Russia.

The White House on Friday announced a new $2 billion security package for Ukraine including artillery ammunition and new Unmanned Aerial Systems and Counter-Unmanned Aerial Systems equipment to strengthen the country's air defenses. The United States and its G7 partners are also set to roll out new economic sanctions against Russia and President Biden announced he will restrict certain exports to Russia and raise tariffs on imported Russian products.

Ukrainian refugees speak out on anniversary of Russian invasion: 'Do not forget us',"In the immediate aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Fox News Digital spoke to a dozen Ukrainian refugees. On the anniversary of the invasion, Fox News Digital reached out to them once again. Of the original twelve, four have died in the war and two were unreachable.

On February 24, 2022, Russian forces invaded Ukraine with Russian President Vladimir Putin's stated goal of ""denazifying"" the country. In the year since the brutal invasion, nearly six million Ukrainians have fled the country and an additional six million have been displaced within the country. Estimates put the Ukrainian military death toll at roughly 120,000 and the Russian death toll at about 200,000.

""The 24th of February started with a phone call from my boyfriend at 5 am with the words 'It started’,"" Diana Shalashna told Fox News Digital. ""I was staying near Kyiv with my grandma at that time. I remember thinking that everything will finish after a couple of days, that it can’t be serious. The sounds of explosions weren’t so unknown to me after what happened in 2014, but I was still terrified.""

""When I moved to Rome, I feel like I have been taken care of with the basic needs: I have a place to live in and food to eat,"" Shalashna told Fox News Digital. ""I am thankful for the Italian government for these programs that were created to help Ukrainians in the country.""

While fleeing the countries provided unique difficulties, millions of Ukrainians in the southeast were caught up in the invasion and could not get out.

""It was just horrible as nobody did not experience such dramatic attacks and horrible crimes,"" Serhii Prokopenko told Fox News Digital. ""I remember cars with people died because of artillery, I remember lack of food and people suffering in need, I remember kids crying in basement of maternity hospital and people died in mass graves all around the Kharkvi oblast.""

""Three month I was living in basement of the building in the city center in Kharkiv. Most difficult was when my hands could not warm up,"" Prokopenko continued. ""So we decided to move to the city living out of basement despite risk. After that I spend days warming on the summer sunlight just to balance my feelings.""

Despite these difficulties, Ukrainians have been making the best of it both home and abroad.

""The British have been friendly and welcoming. My host family are wonderful people,"" Yulia Sosnina told Fox News Digital. ""I had a friend in Britain who knew a family volunteering to host Ukrainians and we are so grateful. The biggest difficulty has been helping my mom, who is retired and does not speak English, but we are living together with my cat.""

Despite a year of intense fighting, the Ukrainians have remained adamant that they should not go to the negotiating table.

""If we negotiate now they are going to come again and again,"" Mila Sirych told Fox News Digital. ""If you are going to surround part of our territory, we will show Russians that you cannot invade our country like they did Georgia and will keep striving towards being a united and peaceful Ukraine again.""

"Ukrainians brace for Belarus-led land invasion by July, escalating Putin's war","Russia’s deadly war continues to rage in eastern and southern Ukraine, but Ukrainians in the north and west are now bracing for a new fight as concerns mount that Belarus could launch a land invasion by mid-July.

Following Russia’s first attempts to take the capital city of Kyiv and its subsequent withdrawal from the north, Ukrainians have done their best to return to normal life.

Anastasiya Koval, a Ukrainian American who just returned from Lviv, said bars, restaurants and shops reopened roughly a month after Moscow invaded in what Russian President Vladimir Putin has dubbed a ""special military operation.""

RUSSIA'S SHOIGU SAYS WAR IN UKRAINE WILL END WHEN PUTIN'S ‘TASKS’ ARE COMPLETED

""The economy has to keep going,"" Koval told Fox News Digital. ""It's a very strange feeling, you have posts, you have soldiers walking around with rifles. There’s sandbags. Buildings are covered, monuments are covered.

""It's definitely wartime,"" she added.

Koval, who returned to the U.S. last week after retrieving her mother from Lviv, said air raid sirens went off three to four times a day while she was there.

""People have just adjusted,"" she said. ""It just got to the point where nobody's even reacting to them anymore.""

The threat that the war in Ukraine poses has not escaped Ukrainians living through the largest European conflict since World War II, and there is growing chatter that Belarus will officially join the war and launch a ground invasion by mid-July.

Last week Russian missiles were fired at Ukrainian targets from within Belarusian territory for the first time since the war began in February.

It remains unclear if Minsk will officially enter the war, but Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukashenko has repeatedly backed Putin and on Sunday told local media he has supported Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine ""from the very first day.""

Russia’s renewed bombardment in northern and western Ukraine has increased in recent weeks despite repeated Russian claims that the military operation is aimed at taking ""full control"" over eastern and southern Ukraine.

""I don't know if Belarus is going to actually invade [or] if it's a scare tactic,"" Koval said, arguing it could also be a ploy to encourage Kyiv to move soldiers off its front lines, which would enable Russia to gain ground.

PUTIN PUSHES TOWARD RUSSIA, BELARUS UNIFYING AFTER NATO EXPANSION

Koval, who has family members on the front lines and elderly grandparents still in Lviv, is helping the war effort through a family-run nonprofit known as Evil Cannot Enter Heaven – a charity run by her father, Ihor Koval, which supplies Ukrainian troops with sorely needed equipment.

Koval’s father was born in Ukraine and served in the Soviet Army prior to its dissolution in 1992. He later moved to the U.S. to raise his family.

He has aided the Ukrainian armed services since Russia’s 2014 invasion and uses his contacts on the ground to get frontline fighters equipment like helmets, bulletproof vests, water filters, boots, tourniquet kits and other medical supplies.

Koval explained that because of the scale of the war, the Ukrainian government is only able to provide roughly 65% of basic on the ground needs.

UKRAINE ACCUSES RUSSIA OF BRINGING BELARUS INTO WAR AFTER MISSILE LAUNCHES FROM NORTHERN NEIGHBOR

The other 35% have to be sourced through personal means or by organizational help.

""He feels it's his obligation, his duty to help defend his land. He's far more valuable not behind a gun but behind a desk because he speaks four languages fluently – Polish, Ukrainian, Russian and English. Which is such a valuable asset right now,"" Koval said.

""He's coordinating so much logistic[ally] and he is literally suiting boys up who would otherwise be dead,"" she added.

Western officials have championed Ukraine’s ability to hold off Russian forces and stop what many believe Putin thought would be a swift operation.

Despite the incremental gains Russia has made in the east and south, Koval said Ukrainians remain convinced they will win in the end.

He said they saw at least two military jets, too many tanks to count, soldiers in trenches and abandoned bivouacs. They could hear distant fighting and explosions rocked the bus as it rumbled toward the border.

‘Absolutely surreal’

""It’s absolutely surreal,"" he said Friday morning. ""These are all images that I associated with Second World War movies – never expected that this is something I would see in my own lifetime, with my own eyes.""

Hours later, he was still waiting at a border checkpoint. He said border guards were turning away men of fighting age – between 18 and 60. He said he saw a 15-year-old crying on a stump after his father had been conscripted into the nation’s defense. Families with pets were not allowed to cross with their animals.

""My mother- and father-in-law were being optimistic that we will see them again,"" he said. ""But I’m not really sure if we will or not.""

Flanagan is the Europe director for the international libertarian nonprofit group Students For Liberty. Its motto is ""peace, love and liberty.""

UN ambassador says vote on 1 year anniversary of Russia's invasion 'will go down in history',"The United States Ambassador to the United Nations predicted Thursday's vote on a resolution on achieving peace in Ukraine will ""go down in history.""

""On the one-year anniversary of this conflict, we will see where the nations of the world stand on the matter of peace in Ukraine,"" she added.

Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, and the yearlong war has involved countries from around the world collectively contributing hundreds of billions of dollars to provide weapons and equipment to Ukraine’s military. Many of the funds have been provided for humanitarian reasons and to repair the country’s infrastructure.

PRESIDENT BIDEN MAKES SURPRISE VISIT TO KYIV, UKRAINE, MEETS WITH PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY

According to Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. stands united with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in keeping Ukrainian territories out of the hands of Russia’s rule.

""Earlier this week, President Biden visited Ukraine. And he made it clear where the United States stands. He stood shoulder-to-shoulder with President Zelenskyy to remind the world that, one year later, Kyiv still stands. Ukraine still stands. And America still stands with Ukraine.""

Biden also announced during his surprise trip that the U.S. will be providing nearly $500 million in additional security assistance to Ukraine.

The president’s visit commitment comes just days before the war reaches its one-year milestone, well longer than experts initially predicted the war would last.

""One year ago, Russia launched its illegal, unprovoked, full-scale invasion into Ukraine,"" she continued. ""I remember that day clearly, as I know all of you do too, as well.""

FOX NEWS POLL: HALF SAY US SHOULD SUPPORT UKRAINE AS LONG AS IT TAKES

Thomas-Greenfield said Russia lied to the international community in the days leading up to the invasion and claimed Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin continue to do so amid global calls for peace.

""That cold February night, one year ago today, I asked Russia to stop. To return to its borders. To send its troops, tanks, and planes back into their barracks and hangars. To send diplomats back to the negotiating table. But it was too late. At that exact moment I joined so many others in the Security Council and around the world in making a plea for peace. President Putin chose war. This was an illegal and unprovoked attack on Ukraine. But it was also an assault on the United Nations. It struck at the very heart of the UN Charter,"" the ambassador said.

She added: ""We all know what happened next, and what is still happening now. The bombing of kindergartens and hospitals. The slaughter of innocent civilians. The worst refugee crisis in Europe since World War II. An unprecedented hunger crisis around the world. Threats to nuclear and energy security. Families forcibly separated, Ukrainian children relocated to Russia, mass suffering. Crimes against humanity.""

The ambassador visited Ukraine last year and said seeing the impacts of the war and the suffering and resolve of the Ukrainian people was an emphatic experience. She also said she learned ""the most powerful lessons"" as she met with refugees and victims, including a 10-year-old girl named Milena.

SIX COUNTRIES JOIN RUSSIA IN OPPOSING UN'S RESOLUTION FOR PEACE IN UKRAINE

""But it was in the faces of Ukrainian children that I found hope. I met a 10-year-old girl, Milena, who lived in a facility where displaced families were gathering to prepare for the cold winter. A facility that had once been hit by Russian missiles. And I asked Milena what she wanted to do when the war was over. And she smiled. She told me, simply, that she wanted to go back to school and see her best friend again. Her face beamed with hope. I will never forget her shining eyes,"" Thomas-Greenfield said.

She urged her colleagues to not grow war-weary but to reaffirm their commitment to seeing peace in the region and to promoting ""diplomacy and dialogue.""

The day after her remarks, the U.N. overwhelmingly voted to demand Russia ""immediately"" and ""unconditionally"" withdraw its forces from Ukraine.

The seals are a small part of the 15,000 artifacts taken from the Iraq Museum in the aftermath of the 2003 invasion of that country.

In March 2021, one of the seals was listed for sale in an online auction, leading Manhattan prosecutors to begin an investigation into the object's origin and provenance. The consignor of the stamp was soon revealed to be in possession of six additional seals that were purchased shortly after the looting of the Iraq Museum. The seals lacked any documentation that would show they had entered the art market prior to 2003.

Instead, it was determined that the pieces were smuggled into the U.S., where they were purchased through various galleries and online auctions by a private collector between 2004-2009.

The seven objects consist of three stamp seals and four cylinder seals, dating to between the Mesopotamian (2700-2500 B.C.) and the Neo-Babylonian (612-539 B.C.) periods. The seals would have been used to make impressions on wet clay, with the cylinder seals being rolled onto the two-dimensional surface.

The objects are carved with images of gods, human figures, animals, and other scenes of worship. Each unique seal served as a personal signature to guarantee authenticity of either an individual or a business.

Douglas Cohen, a spokesperson for the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, told The Art Newspaper that the tip came from an informant who had read Thieves of Baghdad (2005), a book by assistant district attorney Matthew Bogdanos about his experience trailing stolen antiquities.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) partnered with Manhattan prosecutors to return the seals.

""These items were looted by thieves taking advantage of the confusion of war to turn a profit with total disregard to their cultural value,"" said Ivan J. Arvelo, Special Agent in Charge of HSI in New York. ""These artifacts…were a critical part of everyday life in the ancient world. Now, they will return to their rightful home.""

At the time of the invasion, the plundering of the Iraq Museum's collection became the subject of debate on Washington's ability to maintain order in Iraq as Saddam Hussein's police and military unraveled.

U.S. troops, the sole power in the city at the time, were intensely criticized for not protecting the Iraq Museum's treasures and other cultural institutions like the national library and the Saddam Art Center, a museum of modern Iraqi art.

Others claimed the U.S. troops did not have a mandate to act from Washington.

Asked to comment on the looting, then-Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld famously said: ""Stuff happens ... and it's untidy and freedom's untidy, and free people are free to make mistakes and commit crimes and do bad things.""

Since 2015, when the Museum reopened to the public, the debate has faded into the background and Iraqi officials have sought to move forward.

A major moment in Iraqi repatriation efforts came in August 2021, when 17,000 artifacts from across Iraq were returned, including ones held by the family that owns the Hobby Lobby craft store chain, and by Cornell University.

Dr. Salwan Sinjari, Iraqi Chargé d'Affairs to the United States, lauded the results of the recent investigation.

""I’m grateful for the work by the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office for its efforts to repatriate these precious, historic antiquities to Iraq,"" said Sinjari. ""These pieces belong to Iraq—and belong in Iraq—and now they will help the Iraqi people better understand and appreciate our own history and culture with this connection to the past. This is another example of the longstanding cooperation, friendship, and partnership between Iraq and United States.""

World leaders react to Ukraine-Russia invasion,"Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared martial law Thursday and announced the country had severed diplomatic ties with Russia after the giant neighboring nation launched a military invasion into Ukraine.



Beijing on Thursday refused to criticize Russia's attack on Ukraine, instead calling for a diplomatic solution. China also approved the importation of Russian wheat, a move that could blunt the effects of sanctions levied on the Kremlin.



South Korea will sanction Russia over its attack on Ukraine, President Moon Jae-in said Thursday, according to South Korea's Yonhap News Agency.



Reaction from leaders in those three countries is just the tip of the iceberg to news that Russia has launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES

FRANCE

French President Emmanuel Macron says France and its European allies did everything to try to head off the attack on Ukraine. He said they will show ""no weakness"" in their response.

Macron said in a televised address to the nation Thursday that Russia’s attack is a ""turning point in European history"" and as a result ""there will be profound consequences for our continent and changes in our lives.""

He said that ""to this act of war, we will reply without weakness, we will reply calmly and in a determined and united manner.""

""We have tried everything to avoid this war, but it is here and we are ready,"" Macron said.

He said sanctions will be ""proportionate"" to Russia’s military operations, targeting its economy and its energy sector.



""We will show no weakness,"" Macron said. ""We will take all measures necessary to defend the sovereignty and stability of our European allies.""

ITALY

Italian Premier Mario Draghi says Russia’s attack on Ukraine has made dialogue with Moscow ""impossible."" He is demanding that Putin ""immediately stop the bloodshed and withdraw military forces.""

Speaking after an urgent Cabinet meeting on Thursday, Draghi said Russia’s operation ""concerns all of us, our way of living freely, our democracy.""

He said Italy, which has kept its embassy in Kyiv open, fully supported ""very strong"" sanctions against Russia and was coordinating with NATO and EU allies to beef up security on NATO’s eastern flank. He said, ""We are reinforcing our already significant contribution to the military deployments in all the most directly exposed Allied countries.""

SLOVAKIA

The Slovak government has authorized the deployment of up to 1,500 soldiers to help guard the border with Ukraine following Russia’s attack on Slovakia’s eastern neighbor.

The defense ministry said Thursday they will be used if there is a massive wave of refugees.

The government said Slovakia is also ready to open more border crossings with Ukraine if needed.

Slovakia last week lifted all coronavirus restrictions for potential refugees coming from Ukraine in the case of a Russian invasion.

UNITED KINGDOM

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson says Russian President Vladimir Putin has ""unleashed war in our European continent"" and Britain ""cannot and will not just look away.""

In a televised address Thursday, Johnson said the U.K. and its allies will agree to a ""massive package of economic sanctions designed in time to hobble the Russian economy.""

""Our mission is clear: diplomatically, politically, economically and eventually militarily, this hideous and barbaric venture of Vladimir Putin must end in failure,"" Johnson said.

He is expected to give more details about new sanctions later Thursday.

""A vast invasion is underway by land by sea and by air,"" Johnson said. ""(Putin) has attacked a friendly country without any provocation and without any credible excuse.""

The prime minister also said the West must collectively end its dependence on Russian oil and gas, which ""for too long has given Putin his grip on Western politics.""

GERMANY

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has condemned Russia’s attack on Ukraine, calling it a ""dark day for Europe"" and expressing his country’s ""full solidarity with Kyiv.""

Scholz said in a statement at the chancellery in Berlin on Thursday that new sanctions to be imposed on Russia by Germany and its allies would show that ""Putin has made a serious mistake with his war.""

Addressing NATO allies in Eastern Europe, Scholz said Germany understood their worries in light of the latest developments and stands by its commitments within the alliance.

Scholz said he and Macron proposed soon holding an in-person meeting of the heads of government of NATO member states.
