"2023 Oscar nominations: 'Elvis,' 'Everything Everywhere All at Once,' 'Top Gun: Maverick' lead the pack","The 2023 Oscar nominations are in and films, including ""Top Gun: Maverick"" and ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" earned top honors.

A year after a streaming service won best picture for the first time, big-screen spectacles dominated nominations for the 95th Academy Awards.

Tuesday’s nominations were announced by ""Sound of Metal"" actor Riz Ahmed and ""M3gan"" star Allison Williams. Twenty-three categories were voted on by the organization’s members ahead of the live event slated for Sunday, March 12. Jimmy Kimmel is returning to host the awards show.

""Top Gun: Maverick"" was nominated in the best picture category, along with nine other movies including Steven Spielberg’s ""The Fabelmans,"" and James Cameron’s ""Avatar: The Way of Water.""

The movie starring Tom Cruise, had 6 nominations for the following categories – Film editing, Music (Original Song), Best Picture, Sound, Visual Effects and Writing (Adapted screenplay).

For the first time, two sequels — ""Top Gun: Maverick"" and ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" — were nominated for best picture. The two films together account for approximately $3.5 billion in box office revenue.

Sci-fi indie hit ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" led nominations to the 95th Academy Awards with 11, including nods for Michelle Yeoh and comeback star Ke Huy Quan.

Austin Butler landed a nomination for best actor for his role in ""Elvis."" The film received a total of five nominations.

Last year's broadcast drew 15.4 million viewers, according to Nielsen, up 56% from the record-low audience of 10.5 million for the pandemic-marred 2021 telecast.

Compared to the 2022 Academy Awards, this year may see no streaming titles vying for the Oscars' most sought-after award — though the last spots in the 10-movie best-picture field remain up for grabs. Netflix's best shots instead are coming in other categories, notably with animated film favorite ""Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio"" and the German submission, ""All Quiet on the Western Front.""

The Oscar nominations come nearly a year after Will Smith infamously slapped comedian Chris Rock on stage for telling a joke about his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith.

Smith went on to win Best Actor for his role in ""King Richard.""

Alec Baldwin claims gun enhancement in fatal 'Rust' shooting charge 'unconstitutional': 'Basic legal error',"Alec Baldwin's legal team filed a new motion to remove a firearm sentencing enhancement in the charges brought against him, claiming it is unconstitutionally based on a law passed after the shooting on the ""Rust"" set.

""The prosecutors committed a basic legal error by charging Mr. Baldwin under a version of the firearm-enhancement statute that did not exist on the date of the accident,"" a court filing from Baldwin’s attorneys said.

However, the Santa Fe District Attorney’s office proclaimed that Baldwin and his attorneys were attempting to distract from the negligence and ""reckless"" disregard for safety that led to the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins.

ALEC BALDWIN SUED IN ‘RUST’ SHOOTING: HALYNA HUTCHINS' FAMILY SAYS ‘TO LEAVE THIS UNPUNISHED IS UNALLOWABLE’

Baldwin's attorneys argued that the firearms enhancement was not a part of the law when the fatal shooting of Hutchins occurred, and that he could not legally be punished retroactively, according to court documents obtained by Fox News Digital.

Legal experts explained to Fox News Digital why Baldwin's defense chose to file this motion.

""The government can’t pass a law and retroactively punish someone under that law,"" former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani explained to Fox News Digital. ""The judge is likely going to toss that enhancement, and so Baldwin is just looking at a maximum sentence of 18 months in jail. Baldwin is facing less of a legal risk, so he has a lot of leverage going into a trial.""

""The original law that was on the books was very specific in the way it defined ‘brandishing,’ and Baldwin was clearly not in violation of that law, or he would have been charged as such,"" Ted Spaulding, a personal injury lawyer, told Fox News Digital. ""Prosecutors were likely searching for something similar that they could charge him with when they found this newer version of the law that, interestingly, has a harsher sentence of five years and looked like something they could win at trial.""

ALEC BALDWIN ‘RUST’ SHOOTING INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER CHARGES: HIS 4 BIGGEST MISSTEPS

""The only issue is the bill was passed months after the shooting took place, and laws cannot be retroactively applied.""

The new filing comes days after Baldwin's legal team argued that special prosecutor Andrea Reeb should be disqualified from the impending trial.

READ THE COURT FILING - APP USERS, CLICK HERE:

The motion, obtained by Fox News Digital, argued that Reeb could not simultaneously serve as the special prosecutor and as a member of the New Mexico House of Representatives.

""Doing so vests two core powers of different branches – legislating and prosecuting – in the same person and is thus barred by the plain language of Article III of the New Mexico Constitution,"" the legal documents read.

ALEC BALDWIN'S INVOLUNTARY MANSALUGHTER CHARGES: DA REVEALS WITNESS LIST IN FATAL ‘RUST’ SHOOTING

The legal team claimed having Reeb serve in both positions could create precedent that distorts the legislative process.

""Were the arrangement here approved by the courts, future District Attorneys could seek to curry favor with legislators who control their budgets by appointing them to high-profile cases – distorting the legislative process,"" Baldwin's lawyers wrote.

Baldwin's legal team also filed a motion Tuesday demanding a speedy trial and requesting the defense hand over evidence.

The ""30 Rock"" actor was charged with two counts of involuntary manslaughter on Jan. 31 in connection with the death of Halyna Hutchins. The cinematographer died on Oct. 21, 2021, after a gun Baldwin was holding fired on the set of ""Rust"" in New Mexico.

He is set to make his first court appearance on Feb. 24. Baldwin could appear virtually during the hearing, which will be livestreamed on YouTube.

Prosecutors laid out their case against Baldwin in specific detail in the probable cause statement released Jan. 31 and obtained by Fox News Digital.

""Baldwin's deviation from known standards, practice and protocol directly caused the fatal death of Hutchins,"" the documents state.

""By not receiving the required training on firearms, not checking the firearm with the armorer, letting the armorer leave the firearms in the church without being present, deviating from the practice of only accepting the firearm from the armorer, not dealing with the safety complaints on set and/or making sure safety meetings were held, putting his finger on the trigger of a real firearm when a replica or rubber gun should have been used, pointing the firearms at Hutchins and Souza, and the overall handling of the firearms in a negligent manner, Baldwin acted with willful disregard for the safety of others and in a manner which endangered other people, specifically Hutchins and Souza.""

'Top Gun: Maverick': Kenny Loggins talks ‘Danger Zone’ and meeting Tom Cruise for the first time,"Kenny Loggins is ""proud"" of his contribution to the original ""Top Gun"" movie.

The singer, 74, shared with Fox News Digital that being able to record two songs for the 1986 action movie was a ""real plum"" for the musician.

""It was a great period of time for all of us, especially in my life at that time that I got two songs in ‘Top Gun.’ This was a real plum for me, you know?""

Loggins created ""Danger Zone,"" which is also featured in the movie’s sequel ""Top Gun: Maverick."" He was not the original person in mind to sing the song written by Giorgio Moroder and Tom Whitlock.

TOM CRUISE ARRIVES TO 'TOP GUN' SEQUEL PREMIERE IN SAN DIEGO VIA HELICOPTER

""I really wasn't supposed to be the guy to record ‘Danger Zone,’"" he shared. ""There’s a lot of urban legends as to who was supposed to do it. My guess is Mickey Thomas and Starship were probably the first in line.""

During the late 80s, Loggins created hit songs for some of the biggest movies of its decade, including ""Top Gun,"" ""Caddyshack,"" and ""Footloose.""

""I think the reason why I have that whole reputation of being that the movie guy from that era was because I lucked into three really iconic pieces in a row the ‘Caddyshack,’ ‘Footloose,’ and then, of course, ‘Top Gun,’"" Loggins said.

He shared that he has already seen a screening of the new ""Top Gun: Maverick,"" but he still plans on getting a group together and seeing it in theaters.

""It's so amazing,"" Loggins said of the sequel.

Although Loggins made a massive contribution to the history of ""Top Gun"" he admitted to Fox News Digital that he didn’t meet the movie’s lead, Tom Cruise, until six years ago.

""When I ran into him, we were both doing [the late-night show Jimmy Kimmel Live!] together, and that was the first time we met,"" he said.

""And I said, ‘So tell me, you know, the new Top Gun, you're doing it, right?’ Yeah [Cruise said]. I said, ‘Well, is Danger Zone in or out?’ And he said, ‘Kenny, it wouldn't be Top Gun without Danger Zone.’""

Loggins described hearing his song in ""Top Gun: Maverick"" as ""exciting.""

""It was just really exciting to see it in that place,"" he began. ""For me, you know, having been around a while now, what it means is, how will the audience respond? You know, what? Will there be as much attention on ‘Danger Zone’ now as there was back then or what happens next? So for me, I'm sitting there, and I'm excited to see it in there. It's like rolling sevens. But what happens next? That's the big question.""

What’s next for Loggins is his upcoming memoir titled ""Still Alright: Memoir"" that has an expected release date of June 14. He shared that he was originally worried he ""wouldn’t remember enough"" to produce a memoir.

""I co-wrote it with a collaborator. We did like six months of interviews just to refresh our memories,"" he shared.

""The book has a lot of fun anecdotes about what it was like to be a kid in the late sixties, wanting to start a band and then going on the road with a psychedelic band called Electric Prunes. And then one thing leads to another. You know, I think it's a fun book. It's what I wanted it to be.""

Loggins is also making a return to performing for two nights only at the Hollywood Bowl in July. Jim Messina will be ""sittin’ in,"" which is a nod to their first album together. The duo is scheduled to perform a few songs together.

""So, I'll come out and do an hour with Jimmy and then I'll go change clothes and do an hour alone with my band,"" he said.

""Top Gun: Maverick"" is now in theaters.

Another person commented, ""What happened to cultural appropriation? Why is it wrong to dress up as an Indian but okay to mock the Catholic faith. It's absolutely abhorrent and offensive and I'm so sick of the double standard.""

Tom Cruise's 'Top Gun: Maverick' to hit theaters after two-year delay due to coronavirus,"In 1983, producer Jerry Bruckheimer was flipping through the May issue of California magazine when he was struck by a story. ""Top Guns"" read the headline, with a large photograph from inside the cockpit of an F-14 fighter jet. The story opened: ""At Mach 2 and 40,000 feet over California, it’s always high noon.""

""I saw that cover and I said, ‘We gotta do this. This looks great,'"" recalls Bruckheimer. ""It's 'Star Wars' on Earth.""

And at the box office, ""Top Gun"" did nearly reach ""Star Wars"" proportions. It was the No. 1 film of 1986, a rocket-boosted, testosterone-fueled sensation that established the then 24-year-old Tom Cruise as a major star. It made Bomber jackets, Aviator sunglasses and playing homoerotic games of beach volleyball in jeans hip just as it did military service. In the jingoist Reagan-era '80s, ""Top Gun"" was about as American as it gets. The Navy set up recruitment tables in theaters. Enlistments soared.

If all of that – the go-go patriotism, a star-led blockbuster, magazines – sounds like a like time ago, it was. But almost four decades later, and after sitting on the shelf for two years due to the pandemic, ""Top Gun: Maverick"" is flying full throttle into a new world.

KATE MIDDLETON SHARES WHY HER 3 CHILDREN WEREN'T AT THE ‘TOP GUN: MAVERICK’ PREMIERE

In the film, directed by Joseph Kosinski, there's a new mission to win and dogfights to wage. But this time, the task of ""Top Gun"" feels even weightier. It's here toprove, in a CGI, Marvel world, that a propulsive brand of moviemaking fueled by star power, practical effects and filmmaking prowess can, still, summon the need for speed.

""I wanted it to have that old-school experience,"" says Kosinski, director of ""Tron: Legacy"" and ""Oblivion."" Just as Maverick is going back to ‘Top Gun,’ I wanted to take the audience back to that type of filmmaking.""

Paramount Pictures, which held off on pushing ""Top Gun: Maverick"" to streaming, has put a military-grade push behind the sequel. After kicking off aboard the USS Midway aircraft carrier in San Diego (where Cruise arrived by helicopter) a worldwide promotional tour has included stops at the Cannes Film Festival (where Cruise received an honorary Palme d'Or) and a royal premiere in London. The film, finally, opens in theaters Friday.

But where countless decades-later sequels have crashed and burned, ""Top Gun: Maverick"" may be a retro-blockbuster that succeeds – and maybe even rivals the original. The film has certain advantages, most notably the seemingly agelessness of its 59-year-old star.

But ""Top Gun: Maverick,"" in which a middle-aged Maverick returns to the elite aviation training program to train a new generation of flying aces (among them Goose’s hot-head son Rooster, played by Miles Teller), is an action adventure that recaptures a high-flying moviemaking style with modern-day technology. With visceral aerial scenes filmed inside the cockpit and a surprisingly emotional storyline soaked through with memory and loss, ""Top Gun: Maverick"" rekindles a daredevil spirit for digital times.

Early in the film, a skeptical general played by Ed Harris tells Maverick his kind is headed for extinction, a relic soon to replaced by automation. Maverick replies, with a smirk, ""Not today.""

""In the film, he’s talking about him as an aviator. But watching it last week, it did feel like Tom Cruise is talking about the movie business,"" says Kosinski. ""In the age of streaming, he’s still making a really, really strong case for the theatrical experience.""

But does a new ""Top Gun"" fit as seamlessly into today as the original did the Reagan ’80s? The original ""Top Gun"" wasn’t a hit with critics. Pauline Kael called it a ""shiny homoerotic commercial,"" a thread that Quentin Tarantino picked in 1994′s ""Sleep With Me"" when he, as an actor, called it ""a story about a man’s struggle with his own homosexuality.""

Others saw a Pentagon-backed recruitment film with pumped up patriotism, and a portrait of American individualism set against a faceless, country-less enemy. Much of that is still present in ""Maverick"" – there’s no shortage of disobeyed orders and the bad guys remain a blank slate. But Kosinski approached the film as foremost about the close-knit culture of aviators.

""I do feel like the theme of the first film is not really about politics. It really is about friendship, camaraderie, competition, sacrifice,"" says Kosinski. ""That’s what we wanted to do on this film very purposefully. We designed a fictional antagonist. The mission itself is one about keeping the world safe. It’s not about invasion. It’s really about the relationship between Maverick and Rooster.""

In 2012, momentum was starting to gather for a sequel. The original film’s director, Tony Scott, was meeting with Bruckheimer at the Naval Fighter Weapons School known as Top Gun in Nevada. Scott killed himself days later.

""We certainly were doubtful that it was going to happen,"" says Bruckheimer. ""But we still had interest in trying to get the movie made.""

Bruckheimer brought in Kosinski, who had directed Cruise in the sleek 2013 science-fiction adventure ""Oblivion."" Knowing from that experience what Cruise would respond to, Kosinski focused his pitch to the actor on character and emotion. He and Bruckheimer flew to Paris to meet with Cruise while he was shooting a ""Mission: Impossible"" film. The director, who came with a poster adorned with the title ""Top Gun: Maverick,"" had 20 minutes to make his case.

""At the end of that meeting, Tom stood and he walked over to the phone and he called the head of the studio and said, ‘We’re making this film,’"" says Kosinski. ""I mean, that’s a real movie star who can greenlight a movie with a phone call.""

Cruise had a few stipulations. One was that Val Kilmer, who has difficulty speaking after throat cancer and numerous trachea surgeries, return to play Iceman. (The actor appears briefly but poignantly.) Another was that all the actors playing pilots be trained to ride in F-16s and withstand higher G-forces. On the original, only Cruise managed it.

""Tom devised a way to train the actors. In the first one, when they put them up in the air with one camera in the cockpit, everybody threw up. We had no usable footage. Their eyes were rolling back in their heads,"" says Bruckheimer. ""Tom said, ‘Listen, we have to figure out a way to put our actors up there so they can handle the G-forces.’""

It took 15 months, Bruckheimer says, to work out with the Navy, lawyers and the film crew how to have six cameras in the cockpit. Actors playing pilots – Glen Powell, Monica Barbaro, Greg Tarzan Davis, Danny Ramirez, Lewis Pullman and Jay Ellis – were trained over three months to prepare for the velocity of F-18 flights.

""Some actors said, ‘I won’t do it. I’m afraid of flying.’ So we lost some talented people who just couldn’t commit to making the movie in the way we did it,"" Bruckheimer says. ""The majority of the pilots that we worked with on this current movie said they joined the military because they joined the first ‘Top Gun.’""

So ""Top Gun"" has already proved that it can have a lasting effect in the real world. ""Top Gun: Maverick"" is hoping to show that, when done well, big Bruckheimer-styled blockbusters can still outrace anything else in theaters, or at home.

""This film is looking to the future,"" says Kosinski. ""Not only the past.""",https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/tom-cruise-top-gun-maverick-theaters-delay-coronavirus,N/A

""Our actors went through three months of training in various jets. First in a prop plane then an aerobatic prop then in a jet and finally in an F-18, so they can handle all the G forces that the plane puts on, eight or nine G's a time,"" Bruckheimer explained.

""It worked perfectly because our actors in the plane when we actually filmed it was real and that's amazing. The fact that they withstood those amounts of G's and gave a great performance on top of it, it made it a worldwide hit.""

""‘Top Gun: Maverick’ brought an older audience back to the theaters that hadn't been there in years,"" he continued. ""And the critics liked it too. So it was a double banger there.""

""Tom designed this all-encompassing aviation training for all the actors,"" said Barbaro.

The actors were also required to learn how to operate the cameras while in the jets as they needed to act as their own directors at times during flights. Cruise said he was determined to ensure that the cast got it right.

"Gun control activists often the most ignorant on firearms facts, learned terms from 'Crackerjack box': Cain","The most fervent gun control activists and politicians are often the most ignorant of facts and terminology about firearms, Will Cain argued Friday on ""The Five.""

Many Democrats have used phrases like ""weapons of war"" and ""assault weapons"" to describe common firearms they want to ban.

Cain said those who are most passionate about gun control often misuse such terms and don't understand specifications when they mention calibers and magazines.

""[T]he people that are the most passionate about gun control are simultaneously the most dishonest and ignorant people about guns,"" he said.

In the case of describing the popular AR-15 rifle as a ""weapon of war,"" critics often point out that the military does not use the AR-15, in favor of rifles that are able to be fully automatic.

""They use these terms ‘weapons of war’ or ‘assault weapon’ … like they learned them yesterday on the back of a Crackerjack box,"" Cain said.

""They have functional meanings – or they're made up, in either case -- and they do nothing to solve this problem.""

On Thursday, Fox News host Tucker Carlson pointed out one pro-gun control lawmaker, Rep. Mondaire Jones, D-N.Y., said he would seek to prohibit ""semi-automatic weapons"", while adding handguns would ""not qualify"" for the ban. Carlson noted many handguns are themselves semi-automatic.

The Rockland County congressman also called for abolishing the filibuster and ""expanding"" the Supreme Court if fellow New Yorker Jerrold Nadler's ""Protecting Our Kids Act"" gun control legislation is not ""advanced.""

VLADIMIR PUTIN ‘EVEN MORE DETACHED FROM REALITY’ THAN WHEN I WAS IN OFFICE: DAVID CAMERON

On ""The Five,"" Cain added when President Biden demanded America ""do something"" in his speech, he implicitly meant gun control measures rather than other strategies to curb mass shootings.

Biden similarly was criticized for repeating a debunked claim the Second Amendment is ""not absolute"" because Colonial-era Americans could purportedly not own cannons. Both the Washington Post and PolitiFact issued fact-checks on the matter.

On ""The Five,"" Cain said if gun control proponents were sincere, they would address ""all the multifactorial contributors"" including mental health, violent video games and the increase in youth being prescribed powerful pharmaceuticals.

Illinois sheriff refuses to enforce new gun control law: ‘Clear violation of the 2nd Amendment’,"DuPage County Sheriff James Mendrick has come under attack from Illinois state lawmakers after he issued a statement refusing to enforce a gun control law in favor of his higher oath to the U.S. Constitution.

Mendrick, who has worked in the sheriff’s office for ""26 years"" and was elected Sheriff of DuPage County, Illinois in 2018, according to his official profile. DuPage County borders Cook County, home of Chicago.

Chicago is one of the most violent cities in the country and also one of the strictest on gun control.

However, it was Mendrick's Jan. 13 letter — in which he argued that a recently passed gun control law was unconstitutional — that has made him a target of Democrats and gun control advocates in his state.

OREGON SHERIFFS WON'T ENFORCE NEW GUN LAW: ‘INFRINGES ON SECOND AMENDMENT’

""I, among many others, believe that HB 5471 is a clear violation of the 2nd Amendment to the US Constitution,"" Sheriff Mendrick wrote in a Jan. 13 statement.

It was a conclusion that led him to state that he and his office will not check ""to ensure that lawful gun owners register their weapons with the State.""

He also said that he would not apprehend ""law-abiding individuals that have been arrested solely with non-compliance of this Act.""

CT GOV. LAMONT PROPOSES OPEN CARRY BAN, OTHER GUN RESTRICTIONS

HB 5471, which Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed into law Jan. 10, is also known as the ""Protect Illinois Communities Act.""

The law advanced a wide ban on semiautomatic rifles and certain magazines.

However, a number of gun rights groups opposed the law as unconstitutional, with one Illinois judge blocking Pritzker from enforcing the ban just last week.

ILLINOIS GUN CONTROL LAW SLAPPED WITH RESTRAINING ORDER BY JUDGE JUST DAYS AFTER IT GOES INTO EFFECT

Mendrick likewise argued that obeying HB 5471 would mean disobeying his oath to the Constitution.

""Part of my duties that I accepted upon being sworn into office was to protect the rights provided to all of us, in the Constitution. One of those enumerated rights is the right of the people to keep and bear arms provided under the 2nd amendment.""

Democratic Rep. Sean Casten directly targeted Mendrick, reportedly claiming that the sheriff’s ""actions are going to make future mass shootings more likely"" during a Monday press conference.

CALIFORNIA REELS FROM STRING OF MASS SHOOTINGS DESPITE HAVING SOME OF THE STRICTEST GUN LAWS IN US

However, Mendrick responded to criticism that his refusal to enforce HB 5471 would result in mass violence.

""There is absolutely nothing that we are doing or not doing that would make a mass shooting more accessible in DuPage County,"" he said in a statement Monday.

""In fact, I have asked on multiple occasions to increase penalties on all existing gun crimes, but it does not appear that they want to have that conversation,"" Mendrick said of lawmakers.

""They seem more concerned with lawful gun owners than people illegally possessing guns.""

Fox News Digital has reached out to Sheriff Mendrick for additional comment and has yet to hear back.

Oregon sheriff vows not to enforce strict new gun law: 'I take issue with all of it',"One Oregon county sheriff says she will not enforce the Beaver State's embattled new gun law if it is allowed to take effect after a judge blocked the measure last week.

""I can't put handcuffs on someone knowing that there is this black cloud around the constitutionality of that magazine capacity limit,"" Linn County Sheriff Michelle Duncan told ""America Reports"" Wednesday. ""The permitting, we'll have to do what we can for our citizens to make sure that they can still exercise their Second Amendment right.""

Measure 114, also known as the Reduction of Gun Violence Act, was narrowly passed by 50.7% of Oregonians in the November midterms. The measure included a variety of changes, requiring gun buyers to obtain a permit, take a safety course, pay a $65 fee, submit a photo ID, be fingerprinted and pass a criminal background check. In addition, the measure bans magazines that hold more than 10 rounds.

The measure is now on hold after the Oregon State Supreme Court decided it would not grant an emergency motion to overturn a lower court's ruling to block the law from taking effect.

OREGON POLICE WORRY GUN PERMIT REQUIREMENT, MAGAZINE LIMITS MAY INCLUDE OFFICERS

Critics have slammed the strict changes, arguing they take a dramatic step in limiting Second Amendment rights and will hinder law enforcement.

""Quite frankly, I take issue with all of it,"" Duncan said. ""It is it's not good for public safety if I have to pull cops off the streets so that we can issue thousands of permits across just my county alone.""

Gun sales at Oregon's Northwest Armory outside of Portland hit a 30-year-high in recent weeks in anticipation of the new law.

""Oregonian's rights are being trampled,"" shop owner Karl Durkheimer told Fox News last week.

With the police department already spread thin, Durkheimer told ""America Reports"" there are approximately 36,000 people that have delayed background checks ""because the state just doesn’t have the resources to do their job properly like they have been doing for 23 years.""

Duncan affirmed her office is concerned they will not be prepared for the new responsibilities required by the gun law.

‘NOW’S THE TIME’: STOCK UP ON GUNS AND AMMO, FIREARM GROUP TELLS OREGON RESIDENTS AS LEGAL BATTLE RAGES ON

""That $65 fee is nowhere going to cover all the things that we have to do and the manpower it's going to take for our office to do it. The training hasn't even been created,"" she said.

The Oregon gun law does include a carve out for military members and law enforcement agencies when it comes to the magazine ban, but ""solely for authorized use by that entity related to the official duties of the entity."" That has some agencies confused about whether officers will be allowed to take their service weapons home with them.

""The way the law reads, at least the way that I've looked at it, is our own police officers aren't allowed to carry their duty weapons off duty,"" Duncan said.

""It's by far, I think, as we've seen across the nation, the most infringing on our Second Amendment rights.""

A Harney County judge on Tuesday extended the restraining order on Measure 114 an additional 10 days. The next hearing will be held on Dec. 23.

"Oregon's new gun law 'tramples' Second Amendment rights, puts police in an impossible position: Gun shop owner","Gun enthusiasts in Oregon are scrambling to stock up on firearms before a new permit-to-purchase law goes into effect, drastically tightening gun regulations in the state.

Karl Durkheimer, the owner of Oregon's Northwest Armory gun store just south of Portland, told Fox News that gun sales have hit a 30-year-high in recent weeks as Oregon residents await a judge's ruling on whether the start of the strict permit-to-purchase law will be postponed amid Thursday's deadline.

""Two things are happening. There’s fear they won’t be able to get a gun, but there's the actual logistics that they won’t be able to do the background check,"" Durkheimer said on ""America Reports"" Wednesday.

'BLATANTLY UNCONSTITUTIONAL': STRICT GUN CONTROL LAW FACES NEW NRA-BACKED LEGAL CHALLENGE

The new law, which will require Oregonians to receive a permit in order to purchase firearms, bans the manufacture, purchase or sale of ammunition magazines capable of holding more than 10 rounds.

Supporters of the measure say it will curb violent crimes in the state, as well as accidental deaths and suicides. However, critics say the law will limit state residents from exercising their Second Amendment rights .

Sharing a photo of a jam-packed parking lot outside his shop, Durkheimer said Oregonians fear that if they don't apply for a permit immediately, they may not get one in the near future.

""It’s going to take a year before an Oregonian has a permit,"" Durkehimer said. ""If the effective date of the permit happens in the next 30 days – let’s say, that’s what some of the judges have been talking about – effectively an Oregonian will not be able to buy a firearm anywhere in the United States. And that’s a violation of the Second Amendment. The Oregonians will lose their constitutional rights.""

Oregon’s Measure 114 narrowly passed at the ballot box last month, when 50.7% of Oregonians threw their support behind the gun restrictions. Durkheimer blamed residents of Multnomah County and politicians in Salem for propelling the measure to the finish line.

OREGON GUN LAW BATTERED WITH SETBACKS, OUTCRY FROM COPS BEFORE EVEN TAKING EFFECT: ‘GRAVE PROBLEMS’

""Oregonian's rights are being trampled right now, by the Multnomah County voters, the politicians in Salem, and I’ve lived most of my life in Multnomah County. There is some disconnect. I don’t see the connection between lawful gun ownership and violent crime and mental health crises,"" he said. ""The city of Portland has a violent crime problem. The state of Oregon does not.""

The Oregon Department of Justice requested to delay the measure after law enforcement officials came out in full-force that they lack the infrastructure, funds and personnel to create the permit-to-purchase program. A federal judge is expected to make a decision on postponing the measure's start date later this week.

""Oregon is a point of contact for the FBI so the Oregon state police do the background checks. It’s an instant check. Normally, 90% of the people get approved in minutes, seconds,"" Durkheimer said.

With the police department already spread thin, Durkheimer said there are approximately 36,000 people that have delayed background checks ""because the state just doesn’t have the resources to do their job properly like they have been doing for 23 years.""

Anyone whose background check has not cleared by Dec. 8 or the postponed deadline will have to wait to obtain a permit to purchase, according to OSP.

"Philadelphia mayor: If you don't 'back gun control,' you don't 'back the blue'","Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney pushed what many considered tasteless support for gun control during a press conference regarding the Temple University officer shooting on Tuesday.

Kenney, along with other city officials, offered additional details surrounding the murder of Temple University Police Officer Christopher Fitzgerald that occurred Saturday night. While Kenney expressed his condolences to Fitzgerald’s family, he took time during the press conference to call out how easy it is to get guns in his city.

""It is simple, too easy to access weapons in our state and in our region. And that turns too many confrontations into fatal encounters, like an argument over a parking space. We are fighting an uphill battle and it doesn’t have to be this way. I will continue to call on state lawmakers for sensible gun reforms that will protect our city’s residents, including the brave men and women who have taken an oath to protect the peace,"" Kennedy said.

He added, ""You can say you back the blue but if you don't back gun control and gun availability, you don't back the blue. We owe it to them to do everything we can to stop this nonsense and stop this tragedy.""

DAVID HOGG SAYS SECOND AMENDMENT ‘INTENTIONALLY MISINTERPRETED’ TO PROTECT INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS

Several Twitter users blasted Kenney for using an officer’s death to push for gun control.

""while wearing a Ukraine pin,"" author Michael Malice remarked.

""Empty suit mayor who brought back 90s crime rates to his city wearing a Ukraine pin blaming a police officer being killed by a thug on everybody but himself. Basically the perfect image of today's liberal politicians,"" X Strategies senior digital strategist Greg Price wrote.

Florida State Board of Education member Ryan Petty tweeted, ""The sounds of a failed mayor looking to blame cast for rising crime under his watch. We heard similar noises from officials in Broward after Parkland.""

""Pushing gun control while sporting a Ukraine pin as a mayor of a crime-ridden city that has lots of gun control. The state of leftism,"" RedState writer Bonchie commented.

Heritage Legal Fellow Amy Swearer wrote, ""Actually, ‘cops shouldn't be murdered in cold blood’ is perfectly consistent with ‘and neither should anyone else, which is why peaceable citizens also have a right to keep and bear arms in their own defense - a right which your gun control would almost certainly infringe.’""

""Jim Kenney telling people how to or who should back the blue is next level arrogance. This guy is completely oblivious to his self created surroundings,"" radio host Nick Kayal tweeted.

""If you look at the state of New Jersey, the state of New York and the city of New York, they border us, don’t have the problems that we have. This is a gun-crazy state,"" Kenney said.

He also remarked, ""When the Second Amendment was written, it was written for a single shot, muzzle-loaded, long gun used to fight the British. It wasn’t written for an AR-15 or an AK-47 or a multiple-shot clip and semi-automatic handgun. And that’s the problem.

Steven Spielberg tells Tom Cruise he 'saved Hollywood’s a--' with 'Top Gun' sequel,"Hollywood director Steven Spielberg told Tom Cruise that he ""saved Hollywood's a--"" with last year's box office smash ""Top Gun: Maverick.""

""Top Gun: Maverick,"" the sequel to Cruise's 1986 classic, currently has a 96 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes and has grossed $1.48 billion worldwide, according to Box Office Mojo.

Spielberg congratulated Cruise on the film's success at the 2023 Academy Luncheon and credited him with single-handedly saving the theatrical industry. The exchange was captured on video and went viral on Twitter.

TOM CRUISE HITS FIRST RED CARPET IN 8 MONTHS AT OSCARS NOMINEE LUNCHEON

""You saved Hollywood’s a--, and you might have saved theatrical distribution,"" Spielberg is heard saying in the video. ""Seriously, ’Maverick’ might have saved the entire theatrical industry.""

The movie industry appeared to take a major hit during the COVID-19 pandemic, and it offered new opportunities to streaming platforms to attract subscribers. But Cruise was adamant that the film be released in theaters and Paramount Pictures allegedly turned down offers from streamers to buy the film and opted for a theatrical release.

Spielberg had previously commented on the pandemic's impact on traditional theatrical openings.

""The pandemic created an opportunity for streaming platforms to raise their subscriptions to record-breaking levels and also throw some of my best filmmaker friends under the bus as their movies were unceremoniously not given theatrical releases,"" Spielberg told The New York Times.

TOM CRUISE'S ‘TOP GUN MAVERICK’ CO-STAR JENNIFER CONNELLY THINKS HE'S ‘PERFECT,’ DESERRVES AN OSCAR NOMINATION

Spielberg and Cruise previously collaborated on two films in the early 2000s, ""Minority Report"" and ""War of the Worlds.""

""Top Gun: Maverick"" earned six Oscar nominations, including a nod for Best Picture.

Spielberg is also nominated for Best Director for his semi-autobiographical drama ""The Fabelmans."" The film racked up additional nominations, including Best Picture and Best Actress for Michelle Williams. Spielberg has now been nominated for an Oscar for Best Director in six different decades. He's won twice.

Fox News Poll: Voters voice strong support for gun reform,"After a series of recent mass shootings, the latest Fox News national survey shows bipartisan support for a range of gun reform laws, especially background checks on all gun buyers.

In general, a 56% majority believes that having tougher gun laws would reduce mass shootings in the United States, while 39% do not.

On specific gun proposals, voters are most supportive of requiring background checks on all gun buyers (88%) and improving enforcement of existing gun laws (84%).

Another 8 in 10 favor raising the legal age to buy assault weapons to 21 (82%), passing ""red flag"" laws that allow police to take guns from people shown to be a danger (81%), background checks on buying ammunition (80%), mental health checks (78%), and raising the legal age to buy any gun to 21 (78%).

Roughly, three-quarters favor requiring a 30-day wait period for all gun purchases (77%) and increasing the number of armed guards at schools/public venues (73%).

Seven in 10 favor banning high-capacity ammunition clips (70%), while slightly less (63%) support banning assault weapons.

The only proposals tested that lack majority support are allowing teachers to carry guns at schools (48%) and encouraging more citizens to carry a weapon (45%).

TOP SENATE GOP GUN NEGOTIATOR SAYS HE'S ‘CONCERNED’ ABOUT PRICE TAG, RED FLAG PROVISION IN BIPARTISAN BILL

Majorities of Democrats and Republicans agree on each of the policies tested, with at least three-quarters in agreement on the top items like background checks, ""red flag"" laws, enforcing existing gun laws, mental health checks, and raising the legal age to 21. Partisans disagree on banning assault weapons (84% of Democrats favor vs. 44% of Republicans), more citizens carrying guns (30% vs. 60%), and allowing teachers to have guns (29% vs. 67%).

At least half of both parents and gun-owning households support each of the measures tested on the survey. Majorities of veterans are also likely to support them, with the exception of encouraging more citizens to carry guns (47% favor that).

Despite broad and bipartisan support for specific gun reforms, voters split on what the country should focus on first to reduce gun violence: 44% say ""gun control laws,"" while 46% say ""other things, like how we treat mental illness and raise our children."" That is a stark shift from 7 years ago when 19% chose gun control and 67% said mental health/children (October 2015).

That change in priorities shows up across a wide range of demographic groups: Hispanics (+37 percentage points), Democrats (+33), women (+26), men (+25), gun households (+24), Black voters (+23), and Republicans (+20) are all more likely to want to start with gun control laws compared to 2015.

Overall, 6 in 10 think it is more important to protect citizens from guns while 4 in 10 are more concerned about gun rights. Partisan differences are alive and well here, with most Democrats (86%) prioritizing protecting citizens from gun violence and a majority of Republicans (65%) looking to protect the Second Amendment.

Gun households divide on the issue: 47% gun rights vs. 48% citizen protection.

The poll of registered voters was conducted June 10-13, soon after the May 24 shooting in Uvalde, Texas that resulted in the deaths of 19 elementary school students and 2 teachers, and about a month after the May 14 racially-motivated shooting in Buffalo, New York that resulted in the deaths of 10 Black shoppers and workers at a supermarket. Both shooters used legally purchased AR-15 style rifles.

When asked to say in their own words why mass shootings happen more often in the U.S. than in other countries, voters' top responses are the lack of gun laws (36%), mental health issues (15%), the lack of proper parental guidance (5%), and the availability of assault weapons (5%).

Democrats (48%) are almost twice as likely as Republicans (25%) to say the lack of gun laws is the main issue. Republicans are divided between the absence of mental health treatment (21%) and gun laws.

For parents, lack of gun laws and mental health remain in the top two spots, while ""parenting"" comes in third.

On Sunday, Senate negotiators announced the framework of a bipartisan deal on a limited amount of gun safety measures in response to recent shootings.

This prompted a response from the National Rifle Association (NRA) in a series of tweets, including:

""NRA will continue to oppose any effort to insert gun control policies, initiatives that override constitutional due process protections & efforts to deprive law-abiding citizens of their fundamental right to protect themselves/loved ones into this or any other legislation.""

By a 5-point margin, more voters view the NRA negatively (47% unfavorable) than positively (42%). That’s unchanged from three years ago in August 2019, shortly after the El Paso, Mexico and Dayton, Ohio mass shootings (47% unfavorable vs. 42% favorable).

WAPO COLUMNIST ‘EXCITED’ THAT TOP DEMS AND ‘MANY IN THE MEDIA’ WANT GUN CONTROL

2022 Midterms

Voters are clear on what issue will influence their vote in the 2022 midterm elections, as 41% say inflation. While the issue of guns is a distant second (12%), it’s ahead of other priorities like abortion (10%), border security (7%), climate change and crime (5% each), election integrity and voting rights (4% each), coronavirus (3%) and foreign policy (1%).

Who do they trust on the gun issue? It’s a split verdict: 47% say the Democrats and 47% say the Republicans. Four years ago, Democrats had a slim 3-point lead on the issue (June 2018).

President Biden’s job rating on guns is underwater by 27 points: 33% approve vs. 60% disapprove. His numbers are somewhat better on border security (-23 points) and his response to Russia’s Ukraine invasion (-10), and worse on the economy (-38) and inflation (-48).

The most important 'Top Gun: Maverick' moment nearly every moviegoer missed,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

""Top Gun: Maverick"" has worldwide ticket sales that have already crossed the $1 billion mark. If I’m an indicator, theaters sold many of those tickets to repeat customers.

If I hadn’t seen the film a second time, however, I would have missed its most important and revealing five seconds.

During my first watching, the scene entirely escaped notice. Producers had sandwiched it between mission-centered drama and supremely distracting high-G maneuvers. But in my second screening, I caught it.

'TOP GUN 3'? MILES TELLER SAYS HE'S TALKING TO TOM CRUISE ABOUT IT

The scene occurs just before Tom Cruise’s character Maverick leads three other F/A-18 Super Hornets on the film’s climatic mission. It breaks into two segments, one lasting about 1.5 seconds and the second roughly 4 seconds.

To me, these are the most meaningful seconds of the film.

The initial second-and-a-half shows the hangar deck of the USS Theodore Roosevelt. From behind, we see Maverick and Rooster who’ll fly the single-seat F/A-18s on the impending mission. We also see Payback and Phoenix who’ll be flying with rear-seat flight officers Bob and Fanboy.

The film's six stars are standing in front of row after row of aviation personnel. These rows of men and women, dressed in shirts of varied colors, look like a rainbow. Without them, nobody’s getting a jet into the air.

‘TOP GUN: MAVERICK’ STAR MILES TELLER REVEALS TOM CRUISE'S REACTION AFTER DISCOVERING JET FUEL IN HIS BLOOD

They are the indispensable and unsung team members who have maintained and prepared the aircraft that will fly the mission.

Those wearing purple shirts have fueled up the jets; red shirts have armed them.

Green shirts have maintained the engines and readied the catapults and arresting cables.

Blue shirts will run the ship’s massive elevators, unchain the aircraft, and clear the chocks.

Yellow shirts will lock the aircraft into the catapults and send the aviators and their backseat flight officers rocketing off the deck.

Each brown shirt serves as a plane captain; most are under the age of 22, yet shoulder responsibility for ensuring their $70-million jet is ready. Often, their names are painted on the aircraft just like the pilot’s. Aviators will generally concede that the plane captain owns the aircraft; the pilot just borrows it.

Everyone loves the sunglasses-wearing figures in flight suits; they’re just the tip of a long spear, however. Each man and woman aboard Theodore Roosevelt makes it possible for these aviators to drop ordinance on a target and accomplish the ship’s collective mission of advancing national security.

The film's six stars are standing in front of row after row of aviation personnel. These rows of men and women, dressed in shirts of varied colors, look like a rainbow. Without them, nobody’s getting a jet into the air.

I learned this lesson aboard four deployed aircraft carriers and at bases like North Island, California; Pensacola, Florida, and Bahrain while researching my book ""Fly Navy.""

Yet, the passing of time and the sizzle of the new film’s leading actors nearly made me forget that naval aviation includes far more than the men and women in the cockpits.

'TOP GUN' SEQUEL A WELCOME TRIP TO THE DANGER ZONE: REVIEW

The second part of the overlooked scene comes several moments later. We see Cyclone, the three-star admiral in charge of the mission, address the assemblage in the hangar deck.

""This is what you’ve all been training for,"" he says dramatically. Charged and inspired, everyone then leaves to execute his or her precise role.

Initially, I thought Cyclone was just speaking to the six officers about to climb into the cockpits.

He wasn’t.

Cyclone was addressing everybody on the carrier, especially those working the flight deck. They’d trained relentlessly for their specific duties, and success that day required them to shine as brightly as the aviators and flight officers. It was their mission, too.

As a civilian in the world of naval aviation, I found something extraordinary and surprising, and the film gives you a glimpse thereof if you’re quick enough to catch it.

I discovered a shipboard team of unsurpassed ability and sense of mission. I witnessed an operation that strengthens our country by protecting it from enemies. And I saw how that operation also manufactures the citizens America herself needs to thrive.

We need to come together as Americans for gun safety,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

In 2011, I was shot in the head while meeting with constituents. In 2013, two years to the day from being shot and a month after the horrific tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary, I founded a gun violence prevention organization today known as Giffords.

I’ve spent the past 10 years fighting for gun safety — and I’m also a gun owner. As a gun owner, I’ve always believed that gun ownership and gun safety go hand in hand, and that rights come with responsibilities.

Nearly 50,000 men, women, and children lost their lives to gun violence in 2021. Firearms are now the No. 1 cause of the death of children in the United States. Responsible gun owners, like myself, reject the idea that this is the price we must pay for freedom.

MEXICO TARGETS US ARMS DEALERS FOR SUPPLYING WEAPONS TO MEXICAN DRUG CARTELS IN 2ND LAWSUIT

That’s why I founded a coalition within Giffords called Gun Owners for Safety. It’s a community for responsible gun owners to advocate for gun safety laws while standing up to extremists who claim to stand up for freedom — but whose ideas undermine the safety of our schools and communities.

Members of Giffords Gun Owners for Safety have the courage to take action to address the gun violence epidemic. They understand that the right to own guns must be balanced with civic responsibility. They know that gun ownership is not a license to terrorize and harass others with firearms — and they don’t feel understood, heard or represented by gun lobby groups that use fear and extremism to sell more guns.

And they are poised to become an even louder voice than they’ve been before this campaign season and beyond.

Last month, we hosted our first-ever Giffords Gun Owners for Safety Summit in Minneapolis, where ambassadors from states around the country discussed how to best advocate for their communities and how they can make sure their voices are heard this election season. I left the summit even more hopeful that our group can help make a difference.

Responsible gun owners are poised to play a key role in the midterms elections. According to recent polling from Pew, 62% of all voters say that gun policy is very important to their vote in November, ranking just below the economy at 77%. This is up from 54% in March.

Gun owners are also a key ingredient of effective gun safety legislation because we appreciate the freedom to own guns, and the need to ensure that guns are handled and stored safely. Our gun owners have testified and successfully lobbied legislators at the state level to close loopholes in our background checks system, pass safe storage bills and establish and fund research offices across America. And a number of them came to Washington to meet with Republicans and Democrats alike this summer in support of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act.

These responsible gun owners include people like Christina, a Texas gun owner and hair stylist who went to the NRA convention, held days after the Uvalde massacre, and was horrified by what she saw. People like Howard, a longtime Republican, veteran, and retired architect turned gun safety advocate, and Claudia, a grandmother and retired pediatrician who has a concealed carry license and speaks out against permit-less carry laws.

Now, we’re traveling the country to let other responsible gun owners know that there’s a home for them outside of the radicalized NRA leadership. Just this summer, we held in-person tabling events in nine different states to advocate for safe gun storage, handing out free gun locks, raffling off biometric trigger locks and sharing safe storage literature.

When I was in Congress, it was important to me to reach across the aisle to find bipartisan solutions to problems. I believed — and still believe — in the power of bringing a diversity of voices to the table. Our differences make us stronger, not weaker.

Biden announces rule making 'ghost guns' illegal as part of comprehensive gun crime strategy,"President Biden on Monday announced that the Justice Department issued its long-awaited final rule to rein in the proliferation of ""ghost guns,"" making it illegal for a business to manufacture firearms without serial numbers.

Ghost guns are unserialized, privately-made firearms that law enforcement are increasingly recovering at crime scenes in cities across the nation, the White House said Monday.

LAW ENFORCEMENT, BIPARTISAN PROSECUTORS BACK BIDEN ATF PICK

Last year alone, there were approximately 20,000 suspected ghost guns reported to ATF has having been recovered by law enforcement in criminal investigations— which the White House said is a ""ten-fold increase"" from 2016.

""Because ghost guns lack the serial numbers marked on other firearms, law enforcement has an exceedingly difficult time tracing a ghost gun found at a crime scene back to an individual purchase,"" the White House said.

Biden formally unveiled the rule from the White House Rose Garden Monday afternoon, alongside Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco.

""Today, the United States Department of Justice is making it illegal for a business to manufacture on of these without a serial number,"" Biden said, picking up a model ghost gun and showing the audience. ""These guns are weapons of choice for many criminals.""

The president said his administration is ""going to do everything we can deprive them of that choice.""

""Look, this should be just a start,"" the president said, adding that the U.S. needs to ""repeal the liability"" shielding gun manufacturers and ""finally hold them accountable for false advertising and many other things.""

The rule bans the business of manufacturing the most accessible ghost guns, such as unserialized ""buy build shoot"" kits that individuals can buy online or at a store without a background check and can readily assemble into a working firearm in as little as 30 minutes with equipment they have at home.

The rule clarifies that these kits qualify as ""firearms"" under the Gun Control Act, and that commercial manufacturers of such kits must therefore become licensed and include serial numbers on the kits’ frame or receiver, and commercial sellers of these kits must become federally licensed and run background checks prior to a sale – just like they have to do with other commercially-made firearms.

The White House said the rule will also help turn some ghost guns already in circulation into serialized firearms.

Under the new rule, the Justice Department is requiring federally licensed dealers and gunsmiths taking any unserialized firearm into inventory to serialize that weapon.

""For example, if an individual builds a firearm at home and then sells it to a pawn broker or another federally licensed dealer, that dealer must put a serial number on the weapon before selling it to a customer,"" the White House said, adding that the requirement ""will apply regardless of how the firearm was made, meaning it includes ghost guns made from individual parts, kits, or by 3D-printers.""

Biden warned Monday that ""if you commit a crime, the ghost can expect a federal prosecution—not just state.""

""This rule is an important step,"" Biden said.

STATE OF THE UNION: BIDEN TO SPEAK AGAINST DEFUNDING POLICE AMID VIOLENT CRIME SURGE

But Biden, on Monday, said that while his administration is taking these actions, Congress needs to act.

""None of this absolves Congress,"" Biden said. ""Of all due respect to my members of Congress…we need Congress to pass universal background checks.""

Biden said he knows it is ""controversial,"" but said he wants to ""ban assault weapons and high capacity magazines.""

Biden’s 2023 budget proposal calls on Congress to deliver funding to implement his comprehensive strategy to reduce gun crime and make communities safer.

The White House said the additional resources would ""fund accountable policing, including by putting more police officers on the beat, and making essential investments in crime prevention and community violence intervention.""

""Congress needs to do its job by passing this budget and other essential legislation to reduce gun crime, including legislation to require background checks for all gun sales, ensure that no terrorist can buy a weapon in the United States, ban the sale and possession of unserialized firearms -- ghost guns, ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and repeal gun manufacturers’ protection from liability,"" the White House said Monday.

Meanwhile, echoing his State of the Union remarks, the president called for ""additional funding to put police on the streets for community policing.""

""One thing we learned in the middle fo the crime wave not long ago—when the cop knows by first name who owns the corner drugstore, who lives in the apartment above, the people who are the pastors and the churches, guess what?"" Biden said. ""People talk to them.""

Biden, during his State of the Union address, called on Congress to provide more funding to law enforcement, by spending on crime prevention and putting more community police officers on the streets to ""get to know neighbors and restore trust and safety.""

The ""crime wave"" Biden referred to Monday was a reference to violent crime spiking across the nation, after some cities reduced funding for their police departments in the wake of Black Lives Matter protests against the murder of George Floyd in 2020 in Minneapolis. The surge has continued in 2022.

The ghost gun rule builds on the Biden administration’s prior executive action to rein in the proliferation of ghost guns.

In February, the Justice Department launched a National Ghost Gun Enforcement Initiative, which trains prosecutors and disseminates investigation and prosecution tools to help bring cases against those who use ghost guns to commit crimes.

And in addition to the DOJ rule, the administration also took action to ensure that firearms with split receivers are subject to regulations requiring serial numbers and background checks when purchased from a licensed dealer, manufacturer or importer.

Monaco, on Monday, said some of the ""key changes"" include ""updating old definitions to ensure that gun laws apply to all firearms, including ghost guns, requiring gun dealers to run background checks on kits containing parts that can readily be converted into a gun, facilitating tracing by requiring firearms dealers to apply serial numbers to existing ghost guns that they then take into inventory.""

""Because of these updates, law enforcement will have additional crime gun intelligence to stop gun violence, to seek justice for victims of violent crimes, and to get guns used in crimes off of our streets,"" she said.

The Biden administration will also now require federally licensed firearms dealers to retain key records until they shut down their businesses or license activity.

The National Rifle Association (NRA) on Monday slammed the new rule, claiming that the Biden administration is not ""truly sincere"" on curbing violent crimes.

NRA SLAMS BIDEN’S ‘HOLLOW’ GHOST GUN RULE, NOT 'SINCERE' UNTIL CRIMINALS ARE PUT BEHIND BARS

""An administration that’s truly sincere and resolute about curbing violent crime rates would do one thing: take violent criminals off the streets immediately,"" the NRA’s managing director of public affairs Andrew Arulanandam told Fox News Digital on Monday. ""Yet, the Biden administration allows these criminals who kill and maim with callous and reckless abandon, again and again, to roam the streets of Baltimore, Philadelphia, Chicago, New York, San Francisco and other cities large and small across our country without fear of prosecution and punishment.""

Republican Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., also criticized the administration's rule.

""The people of Wyoming see President Biden’s executive action for what it really is: an unconstitutional, backdoor gun grab,"" Barrasso told Fox News. ""This is an attempt to distract from the real reason we’re seeing crime skyrocket across the country.""

He added: ""If Democrats are serious about combatting crime, they need to stop defunding the police and start prosecuting criminals. Attacking the constitutional rights of Americans is not the answer.""

Biden has repeatedly called for additional investments in law enforcement.

The new rules are part of Biden’s comprehensive gun crime education strategy.

Meanwhile, Biden announced his nominee for director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, Steve Dettelbach.

""The mission of this agency isn't controversial,"" Biden said, in nominating Dettelbach.

A White House official described him as a ""highly qualified candidate,"" and a ""highly respected former U.S. attorney and career prosecutor"" with a ""proven track record.""

Fox News first reported that a number of Republican-appointed federal prosecutors have offered their endorsements for Dettelbach as of Monday morning—including former Trump deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein.

The president's nomination of Dettelbach comes as he and his administration work to ensure that ATF ""has the leadership it needs to enforce our commonsense gun laws and fight gun crime.""

Biden, last year, appointed David Chipman as his nominee for director of ATF in 2021. Chipman faced fierce backlash from pro-gun rights groups almost immediately following his nomination earlier this year.

The 25-year ATF veteran has made a name for himself as a strong advocate for increased regulations of guns and has returned to his role as an advisor for Giffords, a gun control advocacy group named after former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona who was shot while in office.

Biden pulled Chipman’s nomination Sept. 9 after his confirmation failed to get through the Senate.

"Biden announces slate of gun control actions, claims 'public health crisis'","President Biden on Thursday announced a set of executive actions and legislative proposals on gun control, saying that gun violence is ""a public health crisis"" and the administration's actions do not contravene Second Amendment rights.

The administration aims to ""confront not just the gun crisis but what is actually a public health crisis,"" Biden said in his remarks in the Rose Garden. He was joined by Vice President Harris.

""Nothing I'm about to recommend in any way impinges on the Second Amendment,"" Biden said. ""These are phony arguments suggesting that these are Second Amendment rights at stake from what we're talking about.""

Continuing, Biden said: ""But no amendment to the Constitution is absolute ... From the very beginning, you couldn't own any weapon you wanted to own. From the very beginning the Second Amendment existed, certain people weren't allowed to have weapons. So the idea is just bizarre to suggest that some of the things we're recommending are contrary to the Constitution.""

BIDEN TO TARGET 'GHOST GUNS,' STABILIZING BRACES IN NEW GUN CONTROL ACTIONS

In attendance were several high-profile gun control activists, including Brady United president Kris Brown, former Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz., and Fred Guttenberg.

An administration official detailed the actions to reporters on Wednesday. Among them, Biden is asking the Justice Department (DOJ) to propose within a month a rule to stop ""ghost guns,"" which are ""kits"" people can buy legally to assemble a functioning firearm that does not have a serial number.

Biden is also asking the DOJ to propose within 60 days a rule on braces used for handguns, which make them more accurate; to propose action on ""community violence intervention""; to publish suggestions for ""red flag"" legislation; and is asking his administration to issue a report on gun trafficking.

Biden also formally announced David Chipman as the director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF).

A senior administration official Wednesday said that Chipman will respect the Second Amendment while he enforces gun laws.

""I've seen with my own two eyes what a bullet can do to the human body ... and I've fought my entire career to fight this violence and to pass reasonable gun safety measures,"" Harris said as she introduced Biden.

""What are we waiting for? Cause we aren't waiting for a tragedy... We've had more tragedy than we can bear,"" she said. ""The solutions exist... people on both sides of the aisle want action, real people ... so all that is left is the will and the courage to act.""

The Biden administration is also expected to throw its weight behind gun control proposals in Congress.

""Enough prayers, time for some action,"" Biden said of Congress. ""I believe the Senate should immediately pass three House-passed bills to close loopholes that allow gun purchases, purchasers, to bypass the background checks.""

BIDEN ON THE SECOND AMENDMENT: 'NO AMENDMENT IS ABSOLUTE'

He also pushed for two gun control laws that would go even further than that.

""We should also ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines in this country,"" Biden said. He said ""there's no reason"" a person would need a weapon that can hold ""100 rounds.""

""We should also eliminate gun manufacturers from the immunity they receive from the Congress,"" Biden said, referring to the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), a law that prevents gunmakers from being sued for crimes committed with guns they sell legally.

""This is the only outfit that is exempt from being sued,"" he continued. ""If I get one thing on my list... give me that one because I tell you what there would be a come to the Lord moment these folks would have real quickly.""

Some of Biden's claims during the press conference are regularly disputed by Republicans, including that gun manufacturers can't be sued and that background checks aren't required at gun shows.

Indeed, the PLCAA only protects against suits for ""harm solely caused by the criminal or unlawful misuse of firearm products or ammunition products."" This does not count, for example, if a gun is defective or if a gun was knowingly given to a person who is banned from possessing one.

BIDEN TO NOMINATE GUN CONTROL BACKER DAVID CHIPMAN TO HEAD ATF: WH OFFICIAL

Further, the ""gun show loophole,"" as it is known, is not actually about gun shows. All federally licensed commercial dealers, at gun shows or not, must conduct background checks. But federal law permits some non-commercial sellers who don't need to be licensed to sell guns without conducting background checks. These sales sometimes happen at gun shows.

Republicans, meanwhile, have expressed their suspicion of Biden's agenda which goes even further than what he announced Thursday.

""By appointing the anti-gun Merrick Garland as attorney general and nominating David Chipman — formerly a senior staffer at the leading gun control lobby — to head ATF, Biden has made clear his sights are set on restricting the rights of law-abiding gun owners while ignoring criminals and foregoing substantive measures that will actually keep Americans safe,"" the National Rifle Association (NRA) said in a statement.

""Further, the proposals Biden announced tonight could require law-abiding citizens to surrender lawful property and enable states to expand gun confiscation orders. The NRA will fight this nomination and ill-conceived executive actions,"" the NRA also said.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., added: ""President Biden plans to announce his attempts to trample over our constitutional 2A rights by executive fiat. He is soft on crime, but infringes on the rights of law-abiding citizens. I won’t stand for it. And neither will House Republicans. Follow the Constitution!""

Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said, ""The answer is not to restrict the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens, the answer is to go after violent criminals and come down on them like a ton of bricks.""

Attorney General Merrick Garland also spoke at the event. He said that gun control is needed to prevent further ""tragedy"" from gun violence.

""We stand here today not at a moment of tragedy but in the midst of an enduring tragedy,"" Garland said.

Brady United, one of the highest-profile gun control groups in the U.S., billed Biden and Harris as ""the strongest gun safety ticket in history"" at an event last fall.

""President Biden’s actions are historic and they will have an immediate impact. These are tangible and powerful policies that will save lives,"" Brown said of the president's executive actions in a statement Wednesday.

City of Buffalo announces 'first of its kind' lawsuit against gun manufacturers,"The city of Buffalo, New York, has filed a ""first of its kind"" lawsuit targeting firearms manufacturers, blaming the industry for rising gun violence despite New York's strict gun control regime.

Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown on Tuesday announced the wide-ranging lawsuit would be filed against ""manufacturers, distributors, and other local gun shops."" Major manufacturers, including Beretta, Smith & Wesson, Bushmaster, Glock and Remington, are named as defendants in the suit, as well as ghost gun retailers Polymer 80 and Arm or Ally.

""Members of our community have suffered too much and for too long from gun violence. We must do everything we can to decrease gun violence. Enabling the possession of illegal guns destroys lives and deeply effects our neighborhoods, especially in Black and Brown communities,"" said Brown.

The lawsuit comes seven months after a racist gunman killed 10 Black people and wounded three others in a shooting massacre at a Buffalo supermarket. Police said the 18-year-old suspect used a legally purchased rifle to carry out the deadly shooting.

TEXAS WITHDRAWS APPEAL TO COURT ORDER BLOCKING GUN LAW THAT BANNED ADULTS UNDER 21 FROM CARRYING FIREARMS

The shocking violence spurred New York Democrats into action and Gov. Kathy Hochul in June signed a sweeping, controversial package of 10 gun control laws that increased licensing requirements to buy rifles, strengthened the state's ""red flag"" law, and ""closed loopholes"" by expanding the definition of a regulated ""firearm,"" among other measures.

Buffalo officials insisted their actions Tuesday were not meant to prevent legal gun ownership.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom endorses even stricter gun control after string of mass shootings,"California Gov. Gavin Newsom called for more gun restrictions Wednesday, including limiting where people can carry concealed guns following a series of mass shootings that left many dead and wounded across the state in January.

On Wednesday, Newsom, a Democrat, endorsed legislation that would ban people from carrying guns into churches, public libraries, zoos, amusement parks, playgrounds, banks and other privately-owned businesses that are open to the public. The rule wouldn't apply if the business owner puts up a sign that says concealed guns are allowed.

""Gun safety saves lives,"" Newsom said at a news conference to announce the proposed bill. ""More guns, more lives lost.""

FATHER OF CHILD KILLED IN PARKLAND SHOOTING SPARS WITH GAVIN NEWSOM OVER GUN RIGHTS: ‘SIT THIS ONE OUT’

State Sen. Anthony Portantino, a Democrat and the bill's author, called the exception of a sign that says concealed guns are allowed ""a legal nuance that I think helps it with constitutional muster.""

""This is not window dressing. This is to put a strong bill on the governor's desk to withstand a legal challenge that is sure to come,"" he said.

California and half a dozen other states previously had laws that required people to give a reason if they wanted to carry a concealed gun in public — like citing a direct threat to their public safety. But a U.S. Supreme Court ruling last year struck down those laws, making it easier for people in those states to get a permit to carry a concealed weapon.

""CCW (concealed carry weapons) holders are not the problem,"" California Assembly Republican Leader James Gallagher told Fox News Digital. ""There's no correlation between those people and the violence and shootings that we've seen in California. That's not the issue when it comes to these mass shootings that we've recently seen.""

Under the bill, anyone under 21 would be banned from having a permit to conceal carry their gun. Permit holders would also be required to obtain additional training, including how to properly store and transport their weapons.

Dan Reid, the California state director for the National Rifle Association, called the legislation a ""political stunt"" that will do nothing to curb violent crime.

""If Gov. Newsom and AG [Rob] Bonta truly wanted to address the violent crime running rampant through their state, they’d put an end to the soft-on-crime policies and no cash bail programs that have turned California into a nightmare for its citizens,"" he said. ""Instead, these politicians have chosen to further restrict the rights of those who follow the law with a political stunt that will not make Californians any safer.""

California Democrats tried to pass new rules last year — and they would have succeeded, had it not been for a strategic blunder requiring a two-thirds vote of the legislature so the bill could take effect immediately. Democrats could not round up enough support, and the bill died.

The newest bill came after mass shootings in Monterey Park and Half Moon Bay left 18 people dead and dozens injured. In total, California saw six mass shootings in January in which 29 people were killed. After the Monterey Park shooting, Newsom said he believed the Second Amendment was becoming a ""suicide pact,"" leading to criticism from gun-rights advocates.

The state is moving in the complete opposite direction of Florida, where legislation was introduced Monday that would allow people to carry concealed firearms without having to get a permit.

In a Wednesday tweet, Newsom argued that states that allow concealed carry of firearms have higher rates of violence.

""Don’t believe the lies of the gun industry,"" he wrote. ""CA will continue to lead on common sense gun laws.""

California reels from string of mass shootings despite having some of the strictest gun laws in US,"A Southern California community is in mourning after a gunman opened fire in a ballroom killing 11 people and injuring nine others during Lunar New Year celebrations over the weekend.

Investigators said the gunman – later identified as 72-year-old Huu Can Tran – was previously arrested for illegally owning a firearm, had a rifle at home, hundreds of rounds of ammunition and appeared to be manufacturing gun silencers.

The massacre and another Monday night in Half Moon Bay have left many unanswered questions as to how it could happen in California, a state which Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna reminded reporters is known for its strict gun laws.

""California has some of the strictest gun laws in the country but yet, look at what we just had today,"" Luna said. ""Let’s look across this nation and see what works and what doesn’t. I can tell you this, the status quo is not working.""

CT GOV. LAMONT PROPOSES OPEN CARRY BAN, OTHER GUN RESTRICTIONS

Advocacy groups regularly rank California among the top states in the nation for gun safety. Giffords, a group dedicated to ending gun violence, has given the Golden State an ""A"" scorecard.

The state has mandatory waiting periods and background checks to purchase a firearm. Military-style weapons are also banned.

California banned the sale of magazines in 2013 and possession of them in 2016. State lawmakers have also passed red flag laws which allow authorities or family members to request a court confiscate a gun from somebody believed to pose a danger to themselves or others.

Last summer, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a package of bills aimed at further reining in gun violence by requiring more accountability for gun dealers and restricting the types of guns that are sold.

Under these new laws, citizens are now allowed to sue gun dealers who ""sell, supply, deliver, or give possession or control of a firearm,"" to anyone under the age of 21. Gun manufacturers also face stiffer penalties in civil court if their firearms are used in a crime.

SAN FRANCISCO REPARATIONS PROPOSAL MAKES WAVES: ‘AMERICA MUST ADMIT ITS SIN’

Short-barrel shotguns and rifles are also banned as are undetectable or ""ghost"" guns, zip guns, and assault weapons.

""California has the toughest gun safety laws in the nation, but none of us can afford to be complacent in tackling the gun violence crisis ravaging our country,"" Newsom said at the time. ""These new measures will help keep children safe at school, keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people and responsibly regulate the sale of firearms in our communities. California will lead on lifesaving policies that provide a model for action by other states and the nation.""

On Sunday, Newsom said the U.S. was unique in its ""constant stream of gun violence.""

On Monday, he accused the Republican Party of bowing ""down to the gun industry."" Some of Newsom's fellow Democrats raced to blame the Monterey shooting on ""bigotry"" before any facts were out. Police have not yet stated a motive, but Tran was Asian, as were all of his known victims.

"China blames US gun policies for global violence, says America exports ‘woes and instability’","America’s ""loose management"" of firearms is creating a ""recurring nightmare"" of domestic gun violence that is now spilling into other countries as U.S.-made weapons and ammunition are increasingly finding their way into the wrong hands, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Thursday.

Wang Wenbin, a spokesman for the ministry, lamented that at a United Nations meeting last week, the U.S. opposed a Chinese proposal to block transfers of ammunition to non-state actors. He then argued that America’s tolerance for guns is creating violence around the globe.

""Gun violence has become a recurring nightmare for the American people,"" Wang said. The U.S.’s loose management of small arms and light weapons and ammunition, massive weapons export and persistent transfer of military articles to non-state actors are equally worrying.""

""A lot of the ammunition from the U.S. have become untraceable and even ended up in the hands of terrorist and extremist groups, posing a grave threat to regional and international peace and stability,"" he added.

Wang said gun violence is increasingly America’s main export to the world.

""The U.S. brings to other countries not democracy or progress of human rights but livelihood woes and instability,"" he said. ""The U.S. needs to know that the more it engages in such exports, the worse the backfire will be on the U.S. itself.""

His remarks came several days after a meeting of the United Nations Security Council, at which China said it is worried that U.S. exports of arms to Ukraine are raising the risk of ""strategic miscalculation and escalation of hostilities"" because they might be misdirected to ""terrorists and armed groups.""

The U.S. rejected that assessment at the meeting and dismissed the ""victim-blaming notion that Ukraine’s self-defense is the obstacle to ending this war.""

"Connecticut Gov. Lamont calls for more gun bans, higher buying age","Connecticut needs to update its assault weapons ban to close loopholes and prohibit more firearms as dealers, manufacturers and others have found ways to skirt the state's laws, Gov. Ned Lamont said Thursday in announcing a second set of proposed gun laws this week.

The Democratic governor also said he wants to raise the age of being able to legally buy a long gun from 18 to 21, which is the age requirement for buying handguns. And he is proposing to increase first-offense penalties for illegally possessing large-capacity ammunition magazines from a misdemeanor carrying a $90 fine to a felony carrying up to five years in prison and up to a $5,000 fine.

Lamont, who also announced gun legislation on Monday that includes a ban on open carrying, said his latest proposals are aimed at preventing mass shootings in a state that already has some of the toughest gun laws in the country, many of them passed in the months after the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown that killed 20 children and six educators.

CT GOV. LAMONT PROPOSES OPEN CARRY BAN, OTHER GUN RESTRICTIONS

""Our gun safety laws are pretty effective,"" the governor said at a news conference at Saint Francis Hospital in Hartford. ""But we are here today because we’ve got to continue to modernize what we’re trying to do because a lot of gun peddlers out there are trying to sell these things and trying to work around our system every day.""

Republican lawmakers and the Connecticut Citizens Defense League, a gun rights group, criticized the new proposals and the ones announced Monday. They said the legislation would affect law-abiding gun owners already overburdened by regulations while not stopping criminals who skirt the law.

""The rampant gun crimes in our cities are not perpetrated by lawful gun owners,"" Republican state Rep. Craig Fishbein of Wallingford said in a statement. He said the proposed laws were part of Lamont's ""continued push to disarm law-abiding Connecticut residents under the guise of public health.""

Lamont wants to add several new categories of firearms to the state's assault weapons ban. The proposal would require owners of such firearms to register them with the state, then ban future sales and purchases after the registration period ends.

The categories of guns that would be added to the ban after the registration period include AR-15-style rifles made before the state's ban took effect in 1994. Officials said gun dealers in other states have been shipping so-called pre-ban firearms to Connecticut for sale at high prices.

Officials said another law would mandate registration and later prohibit firearms that manufacturers have modified in technical ways to avoid them being classified as assault weapons in Connecticut. The law would also add to the ban ""rimfire"" rifles, which officials said are typically used for hunting but can be modified into assault-style weapons.

CT SUED BY GUN RIGHTS GROUP OVER SEMI-AUTOMATIC FIREARMS BAN

Jackie Hegarty, 17, who survived the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting as a second-grader and attended Monday's news conference, welcomed the proposals.

""I’ve seen the devastation that gun violence causes, and I know what it’s like to face tragedy,"" she said. ""Anyone who’s experienced something this traumatic agrees: This cannot continue to happen. No one deserves to lose a loved one, to grieve, to become traumatized.""

Holly Sullivan, president of the Connecticut Citizens Defense League, said the governor's news conference included many inaccuracies, including officials' description of .22-caliber rimfire rifles, which she said cannot fire larger ammunition that would qualify them as assault weapons.

"CT Gov. Lamont proposes open carry ban, other gun restrictions","Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont announced a series of proposed gun laws Monday in a state already considered one of the strictest for firearms ownership, including a statewide ban on open carrying expected to draw strong opposition from gun rights supporters.

Lamont revealed his latest plans to curb gun violence during a news conference in Waterbury with fellow Democrats, including Attorney General William Tong and mayors of the state's largest cities, as well as state and local law enforcement officials.

Lamont and other officials said the legislation, which also includes new registration requirements for ghost guns and monthly limits on handgun purchases, is needed to help curb rising gun violence and crack down on illegal firearms around the state. Hartford, for example, recorded 39 murders in 2022, the most in two decades.

CT SUED BY GUN RIGHTS GROUP OVER SEMI-AUTOMATIC FIREARMS BAN

""That sense of anxiety and fear that many people sense — it doesn’t do us any good to say we’re in one of the safest states in the country ... and people don’t feel safe,"" Lamont said. ""Over this last tough few years, the shootings are up. They’re up across the country. They’re up in our state.""

Lamont and others at the news conference also referred to Saturday night's shooting that killed 10 people at a Los Angeles-area ballroom dance club, in expressing their dismay and in talking about the need for more gun control.

The governor's proposals include a ban on the currently legal open carrying of firearms, while still allowing concealed carrying; limiting handgun purchases to one per month to discourage bulk purchases and illegal sales; and spending an additional $2.5 million on community anti-violence programs.

Lamont also wants to update the state's ban on unregistered ghost guns, which are firearms assembled from kits and do not have serial numbers, making them hard to trace. He said a flaw in the current ban has made it difficult to enforce.

A 2019 state law requires ghost guns to be registered with the state, but only those assembled after the law took effect. Police said it is difficult to determine whether a ghost gun was made before or after the law. The proposed legislation would require all ghost guns, including those assembled before the law, to be registered.

The governor, however, did not include in his proposals a plan he talked about during his re-election campaign last year — eliminating an exception to the bans on certain semiautomatic rifles that allows people who owned such firearms before the bans took effect to keep them.

Republicans in the Democratic-controlled legislature issued statements criticizing the governor's proposals as focusing too much on law-abiding citizens and not enough on criminals who aren't obeying the law.

""Today the Governor and Democrats pitched a familiar path to an ‘everybody problem’ by offering proposals that will again have law-abiding gun owners carrying most of the freight,"" said House Republican Leader Vincent Candelora. ""Missing from their news conference was any talk about focusing on the people who are squarely responsible for causing mayhem in our communities.""

DEM. SEN. MURPHY QUESTIONS WHETHER LAW ENFORCEMENT SHOULD BE FUNDED IN STATES THAT REFUSE TO ENFORCE GUN LAWS

Republican Rep. Craig Fishbein, House ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, added, ""If enacted, these new proposals will do more to harass and restrict law-abiding citizens from exercising their Constitutional Rights, and little to curb the increased violent crime sweeping through our state.""

The Connecticut Citizens Defense League, a prominent gun rights group, did not immediately return a message seeking comment.

Connecticut, state officials and experts say, has some of the toughest gun laws in the country, many passed in the months after the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting that killed 20 children and six educators. The state, for example, bans many semiautomatic rifles and prohibits magazines that hold more than 10 rounds.

More recent mass shootings, including in Uvalde, Texas, last year, have spurred new calls for more gun control in many states.

Gun rights groups, including the Connecticut Citizens Defense League, are currently suing the state in federal court in an attempt to overturn the prohibition on what they call ""modern sporting arms"" such as AR-15-style rifles like the ones used at the Sandy Hook school in Newtown and in many other mass shootings.

Waterbury Mayor Neil O'Leary, a Democrat and former police chief in the city, said fear and anxiety over violent crime are the highest he has seen in his four decades of public service.

"Democrats' public gun registry bill blasted as 'frightening,' ‘anti-police’","A Democratic-sponsored proposal to create a public gun registry poses some dangerous potential risks, including to Second Amendment rights, law enforcement officers are warning.

The bill in Congress represents a ""gross intrusion on your rights and your protections,"" Kevin Hassett, president of the Retired Police Association of the State of New York, told Fox News.

Specifically, a public gun registry would present significant risks for retired law enforcement officers like him, Hassett warned, going so far as to deem the legislation ""anti-police.""

""What good is it for someone who I may have arrested to finally find where I live, see how many guns I have? To what end?"" Hassett asked. ""How does that stop illegal firearms? How does that stop shootings?""

T.J. McDermott, a retired detective, echoed similar concerns, which he characterized as ""downright frightening.""

""We’ve become a society where it’s easy to vilify [the police],"" McDermott told Fox News. ""[Now they’re] turning police into victims.""

GUN CONTROL BILL FROM REP. SHEILA JACKSON LEE WOULD CREATE NATIONAL FIREARM REGISTRY, REQUIRE LICENSING

Both Hassett and McDermott doubted that a public gun registry – or even increased firearm ownership regulations – would deter criminals who blatantly violate the law.

""How does a national gun registry prevent shootings?"" Hassett asked. ""Criminals don’t register their guns. … There will always be people who don’t comply with the law.""

""How does a national gun registry prevent shootings? Criminals don’t register their guns. … There will always be people who don’t comply with the law."" — Kevin Hassett, president, Retired Police Association of the State of New York

A registry would even help criminals find firearms, by requiring law-abiding citizens to register details including how many they have, where they are stored and how they are stored, McDermott added.

""You just let every criminal, anyone that’s bent on bad behavior or obtaining a gun illegally … know exactly where to go to find the guns,"" McDermott said.

""You just let every criminal, anyone that’s bent on bad behavior or obtaining a gun illegally … know exactly where to go to find the guns."" — T.J. McDermott, a retired detective

As previously reported by Fox News, the legislation was introduced by Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, and would implement several other restrictions on gun ownership in addition to creating the national gun registry.

The minimum age to purchase a gun would be set nationwide at 21. In order to obtain a general license, the plan would also require a completed background check, a psychological evaluation and completion of a training course for gun owners.

To obtain a license for a military-style weapon, an individual would be faced with more stringent requirements – including psychological evaluations of spouses, former spouses, and at least two other family members or close associates.

Penalties for failure to comply with the laws would range from fines of up to $150,000 to decades in prison.

Lee's office did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.

The proposal for a national gun registry, however, is not new.

The National Rifle Association called the idea ""dangerous"" in a 2013 interview with NPR, saying it could potentially infringe on people’s Second Amendment rights to own a firearm.

""A registry of people who own firearms - citizens who've broken no law, who are not prohibited from owning firearms - would be very dangerous because it can easily result in confiscation of those firearms,"" former NRA President David Keene said at the time.

A gun registry in theory would make it easier to potentially link individuals to certain gun-related crimes, and prevent illegal gun sales.

But critics, like Hassett and McDermott, say it could also punish and deter law-abiding citizens from exercising their Second Amendment rights, while doing very little to remove illegal firearms from the streets.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrat-gun-registry-police-concerns,N/A
Democrats push assault weapons ban less than one month after bipartisan gun control win,"Congressional Democrats renewed calls for an assault weapons ban and other gun control measures Wednesday, less than a month after President Biden signed bipartisan gun safety legislation into law.

In dual House and Senate Judiciary Committees hearings, Democrats argued that Congress needed to take bolder action to address a spate of terrifying mass shootings.

Within the House Judiciary Committee, lawmakers debated legislation that would ban assault weapons, a term used to describe semi-automatic rifles.

""We all respect the Second Amendment, but it's not without limits,"" said Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I. ""Imagine how much we could get accomplished if we clung to the desire to protect our children and communities as tightly as some of my colleagues cling to their rifles.""

VP HARRIS CALLS FOR 'ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN' ON GUNS 'INTENTIONALLY DESIGNED TO KILL' PEOPLE

Republicans lambasted the bill as overly punitive and nearly impossible to enforce properly.

""If this legislation becomes law, millions of firearms that Americans legally own today will be illegal,"" said Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio. ""Under this bill, if you get one of those legally owned firearms to a family member, or a friend, or a neighbor, you could end up in federal prison for five years.""

A federal assault weapons ban was originally in effect between 1994 and 2004 as part of former President Clinton's crime bill. Since its expiration, Democrats have been actively pushing for the ban to be reinstated.

The move has faced significant opposition from both Republicans and Democrats. At least two House Democrats are expected to vote against the ban when it comes up for a vote in the near future, although at least a handful of Republicans are expected to back the measure.

""Driven by the courage of survivors and advocates around the country, House Democrats have proudly led the charge for life-saving action to combat gun violence,"" said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.

INDIANA CONSTITUTIONAL CARRY WENT INTO EFFECT JUST 16 DAYS BEFORE 'GOOD SAMARITAN' TOOK OUT MALL SHOOTER

During Wednesday's hearing, tempers ran high. Not only did lawmakers accuse each other of political maneuvering and insensitivity to gun violence, but the proceedings also faced disruption from activists in the audience.

Gun control activist David Hogg, a survivor of the 2018 mass shooting at Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida, jumped to his feet and accused GOP lawmakers of doing little to stem mass shootings.

""You are perpetuating violence … stop these things now,"" Hogg said, while being removed from the hearing room by security.

The Senate Judiciary Committee, meanwhile, heard from the mayor of Highland Park, Illinois. That community was wracked by a mass shooting over the July 4 weekend that left seven dead and at least 48 wounded.

""Less than a minute is all it took for a person with an assault weapon to shoot 83 rounds into a crowd, forever changing so many lives,"" Mayor Nancy Rotering told the panel. ""Is this freedom?""

The hearings came less than a month since Biden signed the nation’s first new gun control law in nearly 30 years. That bill, which passed with GOP support, expands background checks and offers states incentives to adopt ""red flag"" laws, which are used to confiscate guns from those deemed dangerous.

Republican supporters of that bill said Congress should learn from its success and look for other avenues of bipartisan cooperation rather than pushing pet issues that have no hope of becoming law.

""We ought to be looking to find ways to harden … places of worship and other public spaces like shopping malls and movie theaters and those kinds of places,"" said Rep. Steve Chabot, R-Ohio. ""We did it for schools. We ought to do it for those things as well.

""The Second Amendment is the whole ballgame; it's the freedom that protects all of our other freedoms. Unfortunately the Biden Administration and Democrats in Congress are hellbent on eroding our Constitutional right to keep and bear arms, whether it's nominating radical gun-grabbers to senior positions in the executive branch or pushing anti-gun legislation,"" Trump Jr. told Fox News Digital. ""The Second Amendment Task Force is entirely devoted to ensuring the Left is never successful in disarming American citizens.""

DONALD TRUMP JR. SAYS HE’LL BE ‘VERY INVOLVED’ ON 2022 CAMPAIGN TRAIL

The Second Amendment Task Force is the first advocacy group that Trump has launched and been directly involved with. The group plans to make a push in the upcoming midterm elections this year, especially in the voter registration sphere.

Additionally, the group says it will fight against Biden administration nominees and Democrat legislative initiatives that could impinge on Americans’ Second Amendment rights.

Trump Jr. was one of several high-profile Republicans who rallied opposition to David Chipman, President Biden’s controversial – and unsuccessful – nominee to lead the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF). He credited that battle for inspiring his decision to launch the group.

""The idea for the group came from our successful effort to stop a radical anti-gun lobbyist from becoming the head of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF),"" Trump Jr. told Fox News Digital.

""We had to make sure that the American people knew what was going on, especially with Red State Democrats.

"Dr. Oz denies writing gun control advocacy columns, business partner claims authorship","FIRST ON FOX: Pennsylvania Republican senatorial candidate Dr. Mehmet Oz this week disavowed a series of columns bearing his byline arguing for gun control in a statement to Fox News Digital.

Oz's byline previously appeared in a series of articles in his ""YouDocs"" syndicated column co-authored with business partner Dr. Michael Roizen.

At various points in the column's run, notably from 2017 to 2019, the articles praised or advocated a variety of gun control legislation initiatives, including assault weapons bans, red flag laws, New Zealand-style gun buyback programs, universal gun purchaser licensing and mandatory waiting periods.

Roizen produced a letter to Fox News Digital in which he stated Oz's involvement in the columns was minimal due to other media commitments.

""Dr. Oz and I have been media partners for almost 20 years, including our best-selling YOU books. We started working on a daily ""YouDocs"" newspaper column in 2007. When Dr. Oz shifted his focus to launch his show in 2009, I took over the sole management of this daily column,"" Roizen wrote.

DR. OZ'S PAST GUN CONTROL POSITIONS RAISE EYEBROWS, BUT HE SAYS HE STRONGLY SUPPORTS SECOND AMENDMENT

Roizen went on to state that there were ""several columns"" where he failed to clarify that the text reflected only his own opinion. Roizen's letter did not specify which or how many columns were erroneously attributed to both doctors, but sought to ""acknowledge periodic errors.""

""When controversial topics arose, we were supposed to debate options. If we disagreed on an editorial direction, I would specify that ‘Dr. Roizen’ felt a certain way. We have found several columns where this process was not followed, I write to ensure that our agreement is part of the public record and acknowledge periodic errors,"" Roizen concluded.

Oz has branded himself as a pro-gun Republican since the beginning of his campaign, and reiterated his support for the Second Amendment in a statement to Fox News Digital about the columns.

""Dr. Oz believes every law-abiding American should be allowed to buy a gun of their choice and he will support legislation in the U.S. Senate that protects our right to keep and bear arms. He does not support any measures that infringe on the Second Amendment and will oppose them,"" Oz's campaign told Fox News Digital in an exclusive statement.

The campaign for Dave McCormick, a Republican running against Oz, argued to Fox News Digital that the columns reflect a larger trend of anti-gun rhetoric from the Oz camp.

""Mehmet Oz has a long public record and history of being enthusiastically anti-Second Amendment. He has supported red flag laws and sided with extreme left gun grabbers to try to take away guns from Americans. Now Mehmet is hoping PA voters will forget he is anti-gun and the fact he will not support our constitutional right,"" said Jess Szymanski, McCormick's communications director in an exclusive statement.

However, Oz's campaign pointed to his years of gun ownership as proof of his support of the Second Amendment, and took the opportunity to accuse McCormick of accepting money from ""pro-gun control advocates.""

""Dr. Oz has been a proud gun owner for many years and he is a firm believer in the Second Amendment,"" said the Oz campaign. ""It’s quite the contrast from David McCormick as his campaign is receiving millions of dollars by Clinton donors and pro-gun control advocates.""

In a statement to Fox News after this article was published, Oz said he's a strong supporter of the Second Amendment.

""As a proud gun owner myself, I'm a firm believer in the Second Amendment and our constitutional right to bear arms for protection.

"Federal judge strikes down California's 'fee-shifting' gun control scheme, which echoed Texas abortion law","A federal judge has blocked the state of California from enforcing a gun control scheme that was modeled after a controversial Texas abortion law, delivering Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom the exact outcome he wanted.

U.S. District Court Judge Roger Benitez of the Southern District of California issued a permanent injunction on Monday against the ""fee-shifting"" provisions of the state's gun law – which empowers private citizens to bring lawsuits against gun manufacturers – declaring it unconstitutional.

""'It is cynical. ‘It is an abomination.’ ‘It is outrageous and objectionable.’ ‘There is no dispute that it raises serious constitutional questions.’ ‘It is an unprecedented attempt to thwart judicial review,’"" Benitez wrote in his opinion, quoting directly from Newsom's criticisms of the Texas abortion law.

The Texas measure makes abortions illegal after a fetal heartbeat can be detected and permits private citizens to sue abortion providers or anyone else who assists in a woman's procurement of abortion for $10,000. This fee-shifting mechanism was designed to protect the 2021 law from judicial review to circumvent the Supreme Court's old abortion precedent in Roe v. Wade. The high court has since overturned that precedent, permitting states to restrict, or liberalize, abortion.

CDC REMOVED STATS ON DEFENSIVE GUN USE OVER PRESSURE FROM GUN CONTROL ACTIVISTS: REPORT

Newsom called on the California legislature to enact a similar law for guns days after the Supreme Court ruled than the Texas heartbeat law could remain in effect following a legal challenge.

California's gun law also creates a private right-of-action for citizens to sue gun manufactures who make ""assault weapons and ghost guns"" for $10,000. Newsom described the law as virtually identical to the Texas provisions, but Benitez wrote that ""California's law goes even further."" He observed that the gun control statute denies a prevailing plaintiff attorneys fees. Further, Benitez emphasized that only the California measure ""applies to laws affecting a clearly enumerated constitutional right set forth in our nation's founding documents.""

OREGON JUDGE TEMPORARILY BLOCKS VOTER-APPROVED HIGH-CAPACITY MAGAZINE BAN

""Whether these distinctions are enough to save the Texas law fee-shifting provision from judicial scrutiny remains to be seen,"" Benitez wrote. ""And although it would be tempting to comment on it, the Texas law is not before this Court for determination.""

The judge's order is likely to set up a showdown at the U.S. Supreme Court, which is the outcome Newsom desired. The governor's office called it ""hypocritical"" to block the state's gun law while permitting the Texas abortion measure to stand.

""I want to thank Judge Benitez. We have been saying all along that Texas’ anti-abortion law is outrageous. Judge Benitez just confirmed it is also unconstitutional,"" Newsom said in a statement Monday. ""The provision in California’s law that he struck down is a replica of what Texas did, and his explanation of why this part of SB 1327 unfairly blocks access to the courts applies equally to Texas’ SB 8. There is no longer any doubt that Texas’ cruel anti-abortion law should also be struck down.""

Firearms enthusiasts crash gun buyback to hunt bargains,"A recent gun buyback event in Oregon, aimed at curbing the number of weapons on the street, turned into a planned profit making opportunity for a group of firearms enthusiasts.

The Jan. 17 event was co-sponsored by Central Coast Ceasefire Oregon and the Newport Police Department, who offered gift cards to superstore Fred Meyer in return for guns, no questions asked. A sliding scale meant assault rifles fetched $175 gift cards each, and high capacity magazines were worth $25 credits at the store, which ironically sells firearms.

Second Amendment supporters took to OpenCarry.org’s forum to spread the word about the event, and to plan out their attendance to make maximum profit.

“A $25 gift card for ""high capacity magazines - like the ones you can buy for $8?” questioned one forum member.

""The turn-in does not pretend to be a market value exchange.” — Julie Wheeler, Ceasefire Oregon Education Foundation

Another forum member, named ""We-the-People,"" explained he would be attending the event to “make $200 profit off of the two junker pistols that I purchased for the purpose.”

Members also planned to intercept attendees bringing in valuable guns, offering them cash before they could go inside and accept the gift cards.

“I picked up five weapons including a Model 11 Remington SemiAuto 12-gauge from 1926, a Mossberg bolt-action 20-gauge from 1947-1950… AND a pre-1900, 12-gauge breech action with Damascus barrel......AND....... a couple of 22 pistols,” wrote the member.

Lauded by organizers as a way to “avoid an unexpected tragedy, and show support for victims of gun violence,” the event netted a total of 138 guns. Those that pass background checks will be melted.

A blogger named ‘Tom in Oregon’ took toTheTruthAboutGuns.com to discuss his experience at the turn-in event. In a post titled “Who Says Gun ‘Buy Backs’ Are a Bad Thing,” he writes about how he gathered up his “jam-o-matics” to cash in.

“I walked up to the first table and handed a Newport P.D. officer my grocery sack with the three zip-tied pieces of pot metal disguised as pistols. He didn’t take a second look at them as he piled them on a cart that probably had 75-100 guns of all flavors of rust,” wrote the blogger.

""Tom in Oregon"" wrote that the event was so popular, organizers actually ran out of gift cards. However, they promised to mail them to those who traded in guns and ammo.

“So I had a nice drive to the coast, spent about $25 in diesel, and in a couple weeks should have $375 in gift cards that I will turn into either ammo, or a subcompact carry piece of a more modern and reliable nature,"" he wrote. ""I love it when a plan comes together.”

Julie Wheeler, president of Ceasefire Oregon Education Foundation, acknowledged that a profit can be made through these events, but insists that is not always the case.

“The opposite is also possible,"" Wheeler told FoxNews.com in an e-mail. ""Some firearms come in that are much more valuable than the awarded gift cards. The turn-in does not pretend to be a market value exchange.”

A 2004 study by the National Research Council cast doubt on whether the programs actually make Americans safer, finding the “guns that are typically surrendered in gun buy-backs are those that are least likely to be used in criminal activities,” explains the study

“In contrast, those who are either using guns to carry out crimes or as protection in the course of engaging in other illegal activities, such as drug selling, have actively acquired their guns and are unlikely to want to participate in such programs,"" the study said.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/firearms-enthusiasts-crash-gun-buyback-to-hunt-bargains,N/A
George Santos cosponsors bill to make AR-15 the National Gun of the US,"Freshman U.S. Rep. George Santos, R-N.Y., is co-sponsoring a bill that would make the AR-15 the National Gun of the United States.

The legislation, H.B. 1095, known as the AR-15 National Gun Act, was sponsored by Alabama Republican Barry Moore, FOX New York reported. Georgia Republican Andrew Clyde and Colorado Republican Lauren Boebert have also signed on as co-sponsors.

""The anti-Second Amendment group won’t stop until they take away all your firearms,"" Moore said Tuesday at a gun shop in Troy, Alabama to announce the bill. ""One rule to remember: any government that would take away one right would take away them all.""

GEORGE SANTOS DELIVERS SPEECH ON HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE AFTER LYING ABOUT JEWISH HERITAGE

Text of the bill was not available Thursday and was not posted on the Congressional website.

Santos, whose embattled electoral victory has dominated his first weeks in Congress, has not publicly said anything about the legislation. However, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul criticized him in a statement for attaching his name to the bill.

""This weapon of war has been used in mass shootings across the United States - from my hometown of Buffalo, where the shooter used a modified AR-15 to murder ten people in a despicable act of white supremacist terrorism, to Parkland, Florida, where the shooter killed seventeen innocent people with an AR-15-style weapon,"" she said.

""The families and friends of those killed in Parkland have become heroic advocates for gun safety - including the Beigel-Schulman family of Dix Hills, who fight for change in memory of their son, Scott,"" the governor added. ""This bill, which attempts to glorify the weapons that have been part of such horrific tragedies, adds unforgivable insult to injury for those families.""

The AR-15 has been used in several high-profile mass shootings and prompted some to call for the outlaw of the weapon along with other firearms.

Santos previously wore an AR-15 lapel pin on Capitol Hill. In an interview with the news outlet last week, he said, ""From the moment we come back from being in recess I'm going to be introducing some original bills and I think the district is going to appreciate them because they are really district-focused bills.""

"Gun control lobby’s latest demands show the goal is to strip Americans of their 2A rights, NRA says","The National Rifle Association warned this week that the new wave of demands from the gun control lobby reveal that their aim is to use the recent wave of mass shooting events to remove the rights of Americans to own a firearm.

The NRA's warning came after a coalition of 117 groups sent a letter to President Biden Monday that demanded a series of actions to limit rising levels of gun violence. There have been more than 1,500 non-suicide deaths from guns since new year, along with 52 mass shootings and six mass murders, according to the Gun Violence Archive.

Amy Hunter, the director of media relations for the NRA, said the groups pressuring Biden will continue to so until the rights of law-abiding Americans are stripped away.

""Biden is more than happy to do the bidding of gun control groups, as he has already proven. They are applying additional pressure because more is never enough,"" Hunter told Fox News Digital. ""Their ultimate goal is a country where citizens are stripped of their Second Amendment freedoms and the government has total control.""

BIDEN SLAMMED AFTER ANNOUNCING OFFICIAL END TO COVID-19 EMERGENCY: 'TRYING TO AVOID EMBARRASSMENT'

Hunter said if Biden and gun control groups were serious about law and order, they would focus more on how to counter violent crime.

""If they were interested in a safer America, they would support policies that put criminals behind bars and protect the rights of law-abiding citizens to defend themselves and their families,"" she said. ""This is why all Americans must stay vigilant and elect candidates who will defend freedom — not erode it.""

Biden received $8.5 million in donations from gun control groups in 2020. In their letter to Biden, the groups called for a national emergency declaration on gun violence, the creation of a federal office of gun violence prevention, a $5 billion fund for community violence intervention programs, an enforcement of the ban on foreign-made weapons, tighter Federal Trade Commission regulations on firearm marketing, education campaigns on gun safety, and a detailed plan on the enactment of the Safer Communities Act passed last year.

""Unfortunately, gun deaths and injuries continue to ravage our country, impacting Asian American, Black and Brown communities, and neighborhoods all across the country,"" the groups wrote to Biden. ""While Congress must continue to prioritize gun violence prevention, you have the opportunity to act boldly by announcing a comprehensive plan of action to reduce gun deaths at the State of the Union on February 7, 2023.""

BIDEN MOCKED FOR REPEATING DEBUNKED AMTRAK STORY ONCE AGAIN: 'THIS IS DISTURBING STUFF'

The Safer Communities Act passed the Democrat-controlled Congress with some Republican support to tighten background checks and red flag laws nationwide.

The demands to the president come amid a new Congress with a Republican majority in the House, which makes legislation unlikely but could prompt Biden to take executive action. So far, his administration has focused efforts on community-based interventions that use billions in federal funds to launch mental health initiatives that counter gang violence.

Gun control advocates said more action must be taken from the White House to counter the new GOP majority in the House.

BIDEN TOUTS ELECTRIC VEHICLE TAX CREDITS WITH PICTURE OF HIM IN LUXURY HUMMER THAT DOESN'T EVEN QUALIFY

Gun rights group files lawsuit over Illinois assault weapons ban,"A gun rights organization filed a lawsuit on Tuesday against Illinois' recent ban on ""assault weapons,"" claiming that it infringes on constitutional rights.

The law, signed by Gov. J.B. Pritzker earlier this month, bans the manufacture or possession of dozens of brands and types of rapid-fire rifles and pistols, .50-caliber guns, and attachments that enhance a weapon's firepower. It also bans sales of high-capacity magazines and requires current owners of semi-automatic weapons to register them with state police.

The Second Amendment Foundation, along with one individual, two gun stores, the Illinois State Rifle Association, and the Firearms Policy Coalition, turned to Illinois federal court in challenging the law, seeking a court order declaring the ban to violate the Second and Fourteenth Amendments, and an injunction blocking its enforcement.

""The State’s enactment, and Defendants’ enforcement, of the prohibition on common semiautomatic firearms, tendentiously and inaccurately labeled assault weapons, and on certain magazines arbitrarily deemed to be of ‘large capacity,’ denies individuals who reside in the State, including individual Plaintiffs … their fundamental, individual right to keep and bear common arms,"" the complaint states.

ILLINOIS SHERIFFS, LAWMAKERS REFUSE TO ENFORCE GOV'S ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN: ‘IN DANGER OF LOSING OUR COUNTRY’

The lawsuit argues that the only types of weapons that can be banned under court precedent are those deemed to be ""dangerous and unusual,"" which cannot apply to those that are in ""common use"" like the types of weapons and magazines banned by the statute.

Fox News Digital reached out to the office of Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul – who was named as a defendant in the case – for comment, but they did not immediately respond.

SEMIAUTOMATIC WEAPONS BAN BECOMES ILLINOIS LAW

Governor Juliana Stratton praised the law in a statement, saying that ""lawmakers, advocates, and gun violence survivors stood together and worked for decisive, protective change."" The lawsuit argues that ultimately the ban will not make a difference when it comes to crime.

""Unlike law-abiding citizens, violent criminals will not be meaningfully constrained by the State’s Magazine Ban. Given the hundreds of millions of such magazines in circulation in the country (including in Illinois, where they remain widely possessed), it will not be difficult for violent criminals to acquire them through illegal sales or importation despite the State's ban,"" the complaint says. ""And unlike law-abiding citizens, violent criminals will have no compunction about violating Illinois’ Magazine Ban. Even if violent criminals were effectively prevented from acquiring banned magazines, they could easily compensate by bringing multiple firearms or magazines with them to the scene of the crime.""

"Illinois governor slams sheriffs who vowed to defy gun ban, says law protects school kids, churchgoers","Democratic Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s office slammed the more than six dozen sheriff’s offices that have publicly vowed to defy a gun-control law that bans semiautomatic rifles and other weapons.

""This is political grandstanding at its worst. The assault weapons ban is the law of Illinois,"" Pritzker’s office told Fox News Digital on Monday. ""The General Assembly passed the bill and the Governor signed it into law to protect children in schools, worshippers at church, and families at parades from the fear of sudden mass murder.""

The Illinois Senate passed its version of the ""Protect Illinois Communities Act"" last Monday, which bans so-called assault weapons and high-capacity magazines from being manufactured or sold in the state. Pritzker signed the bill into law last Tuesday, prohibiting the manufacture and sale of semiautomatic rifles and pistols, .50-caliber guns, as well as attachments that can increase a gun’s fire rate.

At least 74 sheriff offices have since publicly posted statements in opposition of the law, with many calling it unconstitutional.

DOZENS OF ILLINOIS SHERIFFS VOW TO DEFY GOVERNOR'S ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN

""Part of my duties that I accepted upon being sworn into office was to protect the rights provided to all of us, in the Constitution,"" Edwards County Sheriff Darby Boewe said in a Facebook post.

""One of those rights enumerated is the right of the people to KEEP and BEAR ARMS provided under the 2nd Amendment. The right to keep and bear arms for defense of life, liberty and property is regarded as an inalienable right by the people.""

SEMIAUTOMATIC WEAPONS BAN BECOMES ILLINOIS LAW

The Illinois Sheriff's Association said in a statement this month that it has opposed the bill since its inception.

""We, as a representative of chief law enforcement officials throughout Illinois, are very concerned and disturbed by the ongoing and escalating violence throughout our State and Country,"" the statement, released Wednesday, said.

""We are always supportive of new tools, techniques and laws that assist us in preventing and holding accountable those that wage efforts of harm and violence on others. However, this new law does not do that.""

When approached about the dozens of sheriff’s offices vowing the flout the law, Prizker’s office told Fox News Digital that law enforcement offices don’t have the authority to ""pick and choose which laws they support.""

SECOND AMENDMENT GROUPS WARN OF ILLINOIS GUN CONTROL BILL HEADING TO GOVERNOR'S DESK

""Sheriffs have a constitutional duty to uphold the laws of the state, not pick and choose which laws they support and when. We’re confident that this law will hold up to any future legal challenges, but again, it is the current law of our state. Anyone who advocates for law, order, and public safety and then refuses to follow the law is in violation of their oath of office,"" the governor’s office said.

"Illinois loses appeal over gun control law, leaving restraining order in effect","The state of Illinois lost an appeal on Tuesday after a lower court judge issued a restraining order on a newly enacted ban on some semiautomatic rifles as well as high-capacity magazines.

Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed the gun control law on Jan. 10, which bans the sale and distribution of assault weapons, high capacity magazines and switches, which went into effect immediately after he approved it.

Effingham County Judge Joshua Morrison issued a temporary restraining order against the law on Jan. 24, preventing it from being enforced.

Morrison's ruling came in response to a lawsuit from four gun merchants and 850 individuals who argued that the law was enacted improperly and didn't have proper public input, adding that it violated the state and U.S. Constitutions equal protection clause in providing exemptions for some groups of people based on their occupation or training. For example, people who are active or retired law enforcement are excluded from the ban.

ILLINOIS FIGHTS BACK AFTER JUDGE SLAPS RESTRAINING ORDER ON GUN CONTROL LAW

Morrison said in his ruling that the plaintiffs are ""being immediately and irreparably harmed each day in which their fundamental right to bear arms is being denied.""

After an appeal from Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul, Illinois' Fifth District appellate court ruled Tuesday in a 2-to-1 decision that the temporary restraining order can stay in place, and also extended it statewide. Previously, the temporary restraining order only applied to the plaintiffs.

The ruling states that the plaintiffs had a ""a likelihood of success on the merits"" in regards to their argument that the law violates the state and U.S. Constitution's equal protection clause.

Illinois is also facing several other lawsuits challenging the law, including one from the National Rifle Association.

Jason Ouimet, executive director of the NRA Institute for Legislative Action, told Fox News Digital that the law is unconstitutional.

Illinois sheriff who called gun control law 'unconstitutional' will now enforce it if implemented,"A sheriff in Illinois is reversing course and says he will enforce a state assault weapons ban if the law is implemented, after calling the bill unconstitutional.

DuPage County Sheriff James Mendrick said in a Jan. 13 statement that he believes the assault weapons ban signed by Governor J.B. Pritzker is unconstitutional.

""I, among many others, believe that HB 5471 is a clear violation of the 2nd Amendment to the US Constitution,"" Mendrick said.

""Therefore, as the custodian of the jail and chief law enforcement official for DuPage County, that neither myself nor my office will be checking to ensure that lawful gun owners register their weapons with the State, nor will we be arresting or housing law-abiding individuals that have been arrested solely with non-compliance of this Act,"" Mendrick added.

The sheriff said that despite some media reports, he was not ""threatened"" in the meeting.

ILLINOIS SHERIFF REFUSES TO ENFORCE NEW GUN CONTROL LAW: ‘CLEAR VIOLATION OF THE 2ND AMENDMENT’

However, after Mendrick attended a meeting with DuPage County Board Chair Deborah Conroy and DuPage County State's Attorney Robert Berlin, the sheriff reversed course and said he would enforce the law.

""Enforcement of this law does not demand that deputies go door to door seeking to remove weapons from those licensed to own them. With this understanding, Sheriff Mendrick is committed to enforcing all state and local laws,"" Berlin, Conroy, and Mendrick said in a joint statement posted to Facebook on Tuesday.

Mendrick said that while deputies won't be going ""out proactively to take your lawfully owned guns,"" penalties will be enhanced for those using guns in the commission of crimes.

CALIFORNIA REELS FROM STRING OF MASS SHOOTINGS DESPITE HAVING SOME OF THE STRICTEST GUN LAWS IN US

""Those that commit gun crimes in DuPage will find out how seriously we take gun offenses. If you are not using a gun to conduct criminality, you have nothing to fear from us. If your use of a gun is to harm someone within DuPage County, we are united to make sure you endure every possible penalty that we can bestow upon you for your crimes,"" Mendrick said.

Mendrick's initial refusal of enforcing the law drew criticism from Rep. Sean Casten, D-Ill., who claimed that his ""actions are going to make future mass shootings more likely.""

The sheriff responded to Casten and said that ""There is absolutely nothing that we are doing or not doing that would make a mass shooting more accessible in DuPage County.""

""In fact, I have asked on multiple occasions to increase penalties on all existing gun crimes, but it does not appear that they want to have that conversation,"" Mendrick added.

Pritzker signed the gun control law on Jan. 10, which bans the sale and distribution of assault weapons, high capacity magazines and switches, which went into effect immediately after he approved it.

The law is on hold after an Illinois appeals court expanded a temporary restraining order against the law to cover the entire state on Tuesday.

Internal ATF docs show ‘zero tolerance’ guidelines for shutting down gun stores,"FIRST ON FOX: Internal documents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) show the ""zero tolerance"" guidelines the agency is using to shut down gun stores.

Fox News Digital exclusively obtained the ATF’s federal firearms licensee (FFL) inspection guidance from January 2022 that makes it easier to revoke gun stores’ federal licenses.

The guidance says the agency ""has zero tolerance for willful violations that greatly affect public safety and ATF’s ability to trace firearms recovered in violent crimes"" and that ""revocation"" of the FFL’s license ""is the assumed action"" with violations.

GUN RIGHTS GROUP’S ATF REPORT ACCUSES AGENCY OF MAKING ‘ILLEGAL GUN REGISTRY’ AS CRUZ TAKES AIM IN SENATE

""Therefore, revocation is the assumed action, unless extraordinary circumstances exist, when violations are cited that include"" transferring a firearm ""to a prohibited person knowing or having reasonable cause to believe the transferee is a prohibited person,"" failing to perform a background check, and ""making a false or fictitious written statement in the FFL’s required records or in applying for a firearms license,"" the guidance reads.

The guidance defines administrative action ""as a warning letter, warning conference, revocation, imposition of civil fine, and/or suspension of a federal firearms license, including a recommendation of denial of an original or renewal application, and alternate action to revocation.""

According to the documents, the ""ATF must establish willfulness to proceed with revocation"" under federal law, but the agency ""does not have to establish a history of prior violations to determine willfulness.""

""Accordingly, ATF will revoke a federal firearms license, absent extraordinary circumstances on initial violations, if those violations inherently demonstrate willfulness, such as transferring a firearm to a prohibited person; failing to run a background check prior to transferring a firearm to a non-licensee; falsifying records, or making false statements; failing to respond to an ATF tracing request; refusing to permit ATF to conduct an inspection; or allowing a straw sale of a firearm to occur.""

""ATF may also revoke for any other willful first-time violation as it deems appropriate,"" the guidance reads.

The guidance says that the agency ""can establish the knowledge element of willfulness in several ways"" including establishing ""the FFL has a history of similar, repeat violations, and documentation that an [Industry Operations Investigator (IOI)] discussed them with the FFL.""

""The FFL’s compliance history can include other efforts by ATF (including qualification inspections) to inform the FFL about its legal responsibilities,"" the ATF guidance reads, also saying the agency can ""use inspection reports to establish willfulness even if the inspection found no violations.""

""Revocation is also an appropriate licensing action in response to the discovery of the below willful violations,"" the guidance also says, which includes any ""other [Gun Control Act] violation not specifically addressed in this order where revocation may be appropriate.""

Additionally, when an FFL loses its license, it will likely close shop and be required to send its gun purchase records — which are now required to be kept indefinitely — straight to the ATF .

The ATF announced in July 2021 that they would be updating the guidelines established under the Trump administration.

Gun rights group Gun Owners of America (GOA) first obtained and shared the documents with Fox News Digital on Thursday.

Aiden Johnston, GOA’s director of federal affairs, told Fox News Digital that ""Joe Biden has weaponized the ATF against gun owners and the firearms industry in an attempt to violate the Second Amendment and expand his illegal gun registry.""

""Rather than targeting those who display clear negligence and disregard for the law, ATF now revokes licenses without warning at the discovery of a first mistake by honest gun dealers,"" Johnston said.

""When Federal Firearms Licensees are forced out of business, ATF adds their records to its digital gun registry that has nearly a billion gun and gun owner records,"" he continued. ""GOA is already working with Second Amendment champions like Rep. Michael Cloud on Capitol Hill to address this alarming issue and eliminate this unconstitutional gun registry.""

ATF spokesperson Erik Longnecker told Fox News Digital the ""ATF can revoke a federal firearms license for willful violations of the Gun Control Act, especially those willful violations that are a threat to public safety.""

""Such willful violations can include transferring a firearm to a prohibited person, not conducting background checks, falsifying records, not responding to trace requests, and refusing to permit inspections,"" Longnecker said in response to Fox News Digital's question as to why the agency is moving immediately to revocation of FFL licenses for potentially minor violations instead of issuing a warning letter or conference.

""These willful violations are anything but ‘minor,’"" Longnecker said.

GOA previously blasted the ATF for their ""illegal gun registry"" in their new report on the finalized rule requiring FFLs to maintain purchase records indefinitely.

The group’s report on Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requested documents revealed the ATF ""is maintaining a digital, searchable, centralized registry of guns and gun owners in violation of various federal prohibitions.""

GOA wrote in their report that the ""ATF has reached a point where it has converted nearly one billion records (required to be kept by FFLs) into a single, centralized, and searchable national gun registry, that is routinely searched by multiple data fields (except, reportedly, by gun owner name).""

Federal law before the rule required federally-licensed gun stores to hold onto purchase records for a minimum of 20 years. The new rule prevents FFLs from destroying the purchase records should they so choose.

"Will the issue of gun control, violence affect the 2022 midterm elections?","The discussion surrounding gun control in the United States is a core issue for some voters heading to the ballot box this November. At the center of this debate are various political and judicial interpretations regarding the Second Amendment's ""right to bear arms"" and whether legislation designed to curb mass shootings supersedes those constitutional guarantees.

Gun control generally refers to legislation seeking to provide greater restrictions on firearms, from the federal or state government, through background checks, firearm or bump stock bans, red flag laws, ammo limits, and waiting periods to purchase a firearm. In the upcoming midterm election, Republican candidates and incumbents are generally opponents of gun control measures, while Democrats typically support them.

Opponents of gun control laws believe the Second Amendment was designed to protect an individual's right to self-defense and, therefore, lawful gun ownership should not be limited. At the same time, proponents of gun control believe that the Second Amendment was written for organized militias and that in order to reduce gun violence, new limits must be put in place regarding the buying and selling of firearms.

Are any major candidates campaigning to repeal the Second Amendment?

Currently, no candidates from either political party in the battleground elections openly advocate for a full repeal of the Second Amendment from the Bill of Rights. However, some of the strongest supporters of strict gun control legislation are Democrats in the tightly contested elections that determine which party achieves a majority in the House or Senate as well as gubernatorial seats.

Democratic Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams is one of the most significant advocates of gun control in a battleground election against Republican Incumbent Gov. Brian Kemp. Abrams, a former delegate Georgia House of Representatives, is endorsed by Gabby Giffords, a former congresswoman from Arizona who was a victim of gun violence in January 2011 while serving in office. On her campaign website, Abrams advocates for universal background checks, prohibiting private sellers at gun shows from selling firearms without a federal background check, and requiring gun owners to apply for a license to carry concealed weapons in public.

Democratic Ohio Representative and senate candidate Tim Ryan is another major advocate of gun control running against Republican candidate JD Vance. In July 2022, The Human Rights Campaign endorsed Ryan in the election, citing ""his two bills to improve and expand background checks for gun purchases.""

Following the shooting in Uvalde, Texas, where a gunman killed 21 people, 19 of which were children, at Robb Elementary School shooting in May 2022, Democratic Texas gubernatorial candidate Beto O'Rourke renewed calls to ban ""assault weapons."" A day after the shooting, O'Rourke confronted his opponent, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, at a news conference, stating: ""This is on you… Somebody needs to stand up for the children of this state or they will continue to be killed just like they were killed in Uvalde yesterday,""

Is gun control a federal or state issue?

The debate surrounding gun control in the U.S. is happening at the federal and state level. Numerous states have gun control legislation that limits open carry, while other states, typically led by Republicans, have fewer gun control measures. However, at the national level, Democrats, alongside some Republicans, have passed significant gun control measures recently.

After the shooting in Uvalde, Texas, President Joe Biden signed into law the first major gun safety legislation passed by Congress in nearly three decades. The legislation provides incentives to states that choose to pass red flag laws, prevents individuals convicted of domestic abuse from owning a firearm, and expands background checks for individuals over 18 but under 21 trying to purchase a gun.

Which state has the strictest gun laws?

California is widely considered to have the strictest gun laws in the country, according to the Giffords Law Center. In the Golden State, you must be 21 years old to purchase a handgun, 18 to purchase a shotgun or rifle, and pass a background check, regardless of age or if it was purchased at a gun show. Moreover, California law makes it illegal for gun owners to have their firearms removed if they are facing domestic violence charges, or if an individual has a domestic abusive protective order filed against them.

Ammunition is also regulated in California after the passage of Proposition 63 by voters in 2016. California law requires individuals to acquire an ammunition vendor license in order to sell over 500 rounds of ammunition.

BEVERLY HILLS GUNS SEES BOOM IN BUSINESS AFTER FOLLOW-HOME MURDER

What does more strict gun control mean for gun owners?

Strict gun control measures for firearm owners can appear different depending on the state and the law. Typically, more restrictive states such as California may require gun owners to enact trigger locks or gun safes in their domicile where a firearm is present. Other states may require a license to carry a firearm in public or a background check to purchase a gun from a private seller.

Support for stricter gun laws has declined in recent years, according to the Pew Research Center. Approximately half of Americans, 53%, support strong gun laws, while 32% believe the laws are fine, and 14% believe laws should be less strict. In prior years, such as September 2019, roughly 60% of Americans reported they wanted stricter gun laws. The extensive poll and data released by the Pew Researcher Center came out in September 2021 before the Uvalde school shooting.

Has an amendment ever been repealed in history?

Only one amendment has ever been repealed in the history of the United States. The ratification of the Twenty-first on December 5, 1933, repealed the Eighteenth Amendment, which prohibited the sale of alcohol. Any proposed amendment to the U.S. constitution must be passed by a two-thirds majority in the House and Senate. In addition, three fourths of the 50 states must then ratify the amendment.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/issue-gun-control-violence-affect-2022-midterm-elections,N/A
Judge issues temporary restraining order against New Jersey gun control law,"A federal judge on Monday blocked major portions of New Jersey's new gun control law, finding that restrictions on where concealed-carry permit holders may carry their firearm in public present ""considerable constitutional problems.""

U.S. District Court Judge Renee Marie Bumb, a George W. Bush appointee, issued a temporary restraining order against parts of the law that prohibit guns from being carried in ""sensitive locations,"" including public libraries, museums, entertainment venues like stadiums, arenas and amusement parks, bars, restaurants where alcohol is served, public parks, beaches, playgrounds, and airports and public transportation hubs.

The judge also blocked the state from enforcing its ban on carrying firearms on private property without the ""express consent"" of the owner or signage indicating that firearms are allowed, as well as restrictions on carrying guns in a vehicle.

Gun rights groups who filed a lawsuit against the state argued it violates the Second Amendment because it ""essentially renders the entire State of New Jersey a ‘sensitive place’ where firearms are prohibited.""

CALIFORNIA CONCEALED CARRY HOLDER SHOOTS AX-WIELDING ATTACKER ON HIS PROPERTY

Citing the U.S. Supreme Court's opinion in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen, Bumb found that the challenged provisions of New Jersey's law deprived the plaintiffs' constitutional right to carry a handgun for self-defense in public.

""Plaintiffs can no longer exercise this right by carrying their firearms at locations they were accustomed to visiting in their day-to-day lives and in ways law-abiding gun owners routinely do. Additionally, if they were to do so, Plaintiffs would face an ‘imminent’ threat of prosecution, which the State acknowledged at oral argument,"" Bumb wrote.

The judge also criticized the state for failing to show how concealed-carry permit holders pose a threat to public safety.

""[A]t oral argument, this Court specifically pressed the State whether it had empirical evidence to suggest that concealed carry permit holders are responsible for gun crimes or an increase in gun crimes in New Jersey, which they cite as justification for the law. However, the State had no such evidence,"" the opinion states.

Rep. Massie cites Constitution to slam Biden's upcoming 'ghost gun' rule: 'Congress makes laws',"Rep. Thomas Massie and Second Amendment advocates are pushing back against the Biden administration's upcoming rule on ""ghost guns,"" characterizing the rule to rein in privately made firearms without serial numbers as unconstitutional.

""The Constitution does not authorize the federal government to prevent you from making your own firearm. This a fact that has been recognized for 200+ years. Also, Article 1, Section 1 (literally the first operative sentence in the Constitution) says Congress makes law, not POTUS!"" Rep. Thomas Massie tweeted Sunday.

BIDEN EXPECTED TO RELEASE RULE ON GHOST GUNS IN DAYS

Biden will nominate Steve Dettelbach, an Obama-era former U.S. attorney from Ohio, as his nominee to lead the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives on Monday, according to senior administration officials. The president will also deliver remarks from the Rose Garden on measures his administration is taking on gun control and cracking down on ""ghost guns,"" which are privately made and don’t have serial numbers.

OHIO GOV. DEWINE SIGNS BILL ALLOWING PEOPLE TO CARRY CONCEALED FIREARMS WITHOUT A PERMIT

The Biden administration plans to reclassify gun kits to qualify as firearms under the Gun Control Act, requiring manufacturers to be licensed and include serial numbers on the kits. Commercial sellers will also be required to run background checks before sales of the kits, according to senior administration officials.

""An administration that’s truly sincere and resolute about curbing violent crime rates would do one thing: take violent criminals off the streets immediately,"" the NRA's managing director of public affairs Andrew Arulanandam told Fox News Digital Monday when reached for comment on the matter. ""Yet, the Biden administration allows these criminals who kill and maim with callous and reckless abandon, again and again, to roam the streets of Baltimore, Philadelphia, Chicago, New York, San Francisco and other cities large and small across our country without fear of prosecution and punishment.""

Arulanandam said that Americans know ""the lenient bail system and the revolving door justice system supported and perpetrated by the Biden administration and other leaders who support soft-on-criminal policies are the problem.""

""However, today, the president unveils yet another hollow plan that will not stop this violence. His gun control actions will undoubtedly hearten his wealthy gun control supporters. But, this action sends the wrong message to violent criminals, because this ‘ban’ will not affect them. These violent crime sprees will continue unabated until they are arrested, prosecuted and punished.""

Other Second Amendment advocates and conservatives sounded off that Massie is ""spot on"" with his criticisms.

The rule has been making its way through the federal regulation process for nearly a year, with gun safety groups and Democrats in Congress pushing for the Justice Department to finish the rule for months.

""Ghost guns are the weapon of choice for criminals, gangs, and domestic abusers, because they’re easy to obtain and hard to trace when they’re used in a crime,"" Michael Gwin, a White House spokesperson, told Fox News Digital when approached for comment on resistance to the rule Monday morning.

""That’s why law enforcement officials from coast to coast have identified ghost guns as a major threat to public safety and a driving force behind the surge in gun crime we see in our communities. Who in their right mind would oppose action to help keep these guns out of the hands of criminals and make it easier for law enforcement to find the shooters when they are used?""

""It’s high time for a ghost gun exorcism before the proliferation peaks and before more people get hurt — or worse,"" Sen. Chuck Schumer said in a statement Sunday. ""My message is a simple one: No more waiting on these proposed federal rules."" Ghost guns are ""too easy to build, too hard to trace and too dangerous to ignore.""

"Michigan Gov. Whitmer plans to enact stricter gun laws, repeal abortion restrictions, provide tax relief","Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer outlined an agenda Wednesday that will prioritize enacting stricter gun laws, repealing outdated laws that restrict abortion and who one can marry and providing pre-K education for all 4-year-olds in the state.

Whitmer, in her fifth State of the State speech, also pledged to help with rising costs through ""immediate"" tax relief, which she outlined in a three-tier plan that includes an increased earned income tax credit and repeal of the retirement tax.

The 51-year-old Democrat, who won reelection by nearly 11 percentage points last November, could see the majority of her agenda become a reality with Democrats taking full control of the state government for the first time in decades.

Addressing the full Legislature in the House chamber, Whitmer also called for gun control legislation that includes universal background checks, safe storage laws and ""extreme risk protection orders"" that are also known as ""red flag"" laws.

Whitmer made clear that she was ""not talking about law-abiding citizens."" But she said that ""despite pleas"" from the families of a 2021 school shooting at Oxford High School in southeastern Michigan, ""these issues never even got a hearing in the Legislature.""

""The time for only thoughts and prayers is over,"" Whitmer said. ""It’s time for commonsense action to reduce gun violence in our communities.""

MICHIGAN GOV. WHITMER EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE PLAN TO PROVIDE PRE-K FOR ALL 4-YEAR-OLDS IN THE STATE

Following the speech, Senate Republican Leader Aric Nesbitt cautioned against any sweeping gun legislation, saying that the Legislature needed to ""make sure to find a balance with any of this and protect the rights of the individual.""

The State of the State speech marked one of the first times that Whitmer has summarized specific legislation for the upcoming year, and Republicans have criticized the governor for not outlining a broader plan to help Michigan residents.

""She’s got the House, the Senate and herself. Where is the roads plan? Where’s her infrastructure plan?"" House Republican Leader Matt Hall told reporters. ""Or are we only going to get from her a bunch of statements about new government programs that she wants to create?""

Michigan’s budget surplus is projected to reach $9.2 billion by next fall, with $4.1 billion in the school aid fund.

Whitmer also pledged to continue fighting for ""strong protections for our fundamental rights,"" which comes after voters passed proposals to expand voting access and protect the right to abortion in the state’s constitution.

""I’ll go to any state that restricts people’s freedoms and win business and hardworking people from them. I’m looking at you, Ohio and Indiana,"" Whitmer said.

Plans to help Michigan residents with rising costs were unveiled in Whitmer's ""Lowering MI Costs"" plan, which she says will save families an average of $10,000 by providing free pre-K for all 4-year-olds.

MICHIGAN GOV. WHITMER HEADED TO EUROPE, WEF MEETING IN DAVOS

By providing pre-K to over 100,000 4-year-old children yearly, Whitmer would deliver on a promise she first made when running for governor in 2018. She said the plan, which will take four years to implement, will help ""parents, especially moms, go back to work, and it will launch hundreds more preschool classrooms across Michigan, supporting thousands of jobs.""

Former Republican Lt. Gov. Brian Calley, who is now president and CEO of the Small Business Association of Michigan, said in a statement that Whitmer's plan ""will ensure that every 4-year-old in Michigan can get a free preschool education by the end of her second term.""

The full ""Lowering MI Costs"" proposal will also include a previously announced repeal of the retirement tax and a significant increase of the state’s earned income tax credit.

While Whitmer and other Democratic leaders in the Legislature announced tax cut plans during a news conference Jan. 12, the extent of the relief is still being negotiated in the Legislature. The Senate Housing and Human Services Committee moved a bill Tuesday that would raise the Earned Income Tax Credit from a 6% match of the federal credit to 30% and would be retroactive to the 2022 tax year.

House Republicans also appear to be on board with the increased tax credit. State Rep. Bill G. Schuette of Midland said in a statement that he is ""pleased"" Senate Democrats amended the bill to be retroactive to the 2022 tax year.

Whitmer didn't specifically address the Senate Democrats' plan in her statement, but she said boosting the tax credit would ""deliver an average combined refund of $3,000 to over 700,000 working families across Michigan.""

The proposals passed the House Consumer and Public Affairs Committee and head next to the House Judiciary Committee, potentially their final step before reaching the full chamber.

House approval would send the bills to the state Senate.

Lawmakers have until March 18 to grant final passage that would send a bill to Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham.

Democratic legislators are pursuing aggressive new gun-control measures intended to address mass shootings and other crime.

But Republican lawmakers and other opponents said the restrictions would interfere with the rights of law-abiding citizens and do nothing to deter crime.

Pentagon panel recommends bases stop selling guns to troops under 25 to fight suicides,"An external evaluation of suicide in the U.S. military has produced a report calling for greater gun control restrictions for troops.

The Suicide Prevention and Response Independent Review Committee (SPRIRC) was formed by the Department of Defense in March 2020 to help combat the rising rate of suicides among servicemembers.

In the committee's report, released Friday, the independent body recommends, ""On DoD property, raise the minimum age for purchasing firearms and ammunition to 25 years.""

VA HIRED HUNDREDS OF EMPLOYEES WITH DRUG-RELATED CRIMINAL HISTORY, PUTTING VETERANS AT RISK: WATCHDOG

The committee designated the suggested ban on gun purchases for soldiers under 25 as ""high priority"" and a factor that ""must change.""

The report goes on to suggest several other alterations to gun laws on DOD property that reflect common gun control tactics, including suggestions to ""implement a 7-day waiting period for any firearm purchased on DoD property"" and ""develop a national database for recording serial numbers of firearms purchased on DoD property.""

RESEARCH GROUP THAT IMPROPERLY OBTAINED MILITARY RECORDS OF GOP CANDIDATES WAS PAID BY TWO DEM COMMITTEES

""In this report, the SPRIRC emphasized that effectively preventing and responding to suicide will require a multifactorial approach, as deaths by suicide among service members are complex; thus, simple or singular strategies will not work,"" the committee wrote in its executive summary.

The report also recommends that the DOD ""implement a 4-day waiting period for ammunition purchases on DoD property to follow purchases and receipt of firearms purchased on DoD property.""

Republicans push CDC to reinstate defensive gun use data after gun control activists had it removed from site,"Republican lawmakers are pressing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to reinstate data on defensive gun use to its website after removing it at the request of gun control advocates.

Reps. August Pfluger, R-Texas, and Elise Stefanik, R-NY, sent a letter to CDC director Rochelle Walensky on Monday requesting more information about how the CDC decided to remove the data, according to a copy of the letter obtained by Fox News Digital. The CDC removed references to a study it commissioned following a series of 2021 meetings with gun control advocates.

""Public trust in the CDC is already at an all-time low. Now, we find out the supposed ‘non-partisan agency’ is removing information that gun control activists don’t like. The CDC’s own study showed that Americans have relied on their own guns for self-defense upwards of 2.5 million times in a year. Congress needs to act and put guardrails in place to protect from this behavior,"" Pfluger told Fox News Digital in a statement.

""The CDC must immediately end their blatant politicization of the facts in pursuit of the Far Left anti-gun agenda,"" Stefanik said in another statement to Fox. ""The Biden Administration is shamefully lying to the American people and hiding the facts of how law-abiding citizens use their Constitutionally-protected Second Amendment rights to keep our families and communities safe.""

The pair's letter goes on to seek answers about the CDC's process for removing the data, such as whether it consulted any outside groups before removing it, and how it plans to provide accurate defensive gun use data for Americans.

The CDC did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.

The CDC-commissioned study, authored by Florida State University emeritus professor Gary Kleck, found that instances of defensive gun use take place anywhere from 60,000 times to 2.5 million times per year in the U.S.

OREGON POLICE WORRY GUN PERMIT REQUIREMENT, MAGAZINE LIMITS MAY INCLUDE OFFICERS

Mark Bryant, executive director of the pro-gun control Gun Violence Archive, told CDC officials that the data needed to be ""killed, buried, dug up, killed again and buried again"" in an email and subsequent meeting.

While CDC officials initially resisted his request, they ultimately agreed to remove the study from their website.

Pfluger and Stefanik argue that Americans' confidence in the CDC is already at an ""all-time low"" following its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, and this only worsens the issue.

""Opinions of the nation’s institutions continue to be low due to overt politicization — the CDC censoring public health facts at the behest of gun control advocates will only add to the mistrust. The removal of a study – commissioned by the CDC – indicates that the CDC is avoiding the responsibility bestowed to them by Congress,"" the pair wrote in the letter. ""This censorship panders to the activist groups who aim to cover up the fact that much of the firearm industry prevails because consumers seek the ability to protect their life, liberty, and property.""",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/republicans-push-cdc-reinstate-defensive-gun-use-data-gun-control-activists-removed-site,N/A
Second Amendment groups warn of Illinois gun control bill heading to governor's desk,"Gun rights groups are promising to fight a proposed semiautomatic weapons ban in Illinois after the state Senate advanced gun control legislation championed by Democrats.

The Illinois Senate on Monday passed its version of the ""Protect Illinois Communities Act,"" which would ban so-called assault weapons and high-capacity magazines from being manufactured or sold in the state. The bill also makes devices intended to increase the rate-of-fire of semiautomatic weapons illegal, and increases the duration of a firearm restraining order from six months up to one year under the state's red flag law.

""Gun violence is an epidemic that is plaguing every corner of this state and the people of Illinois are demanding substantive action,"" said Democratic Senate President Don Harmon. ""With this legislation we are delivering on the promises Democrats have made and, together, we are making Illinois’ gun laws a model for the nation.""

The legislation would ban the manufacture or possession of dozens of brands and types of rapid-fire rifles and pistols, .50-caliber guns and attachments that enhance a weapon's firepower. Those who currently own such guns would not be required to surrender them but would have to register them with the Illinois State Police — including serial numbers, a provision initially removed by the Senate but restored after House proponents' objections.

IL SENATE PASSES SEMIAUTOMATIC WEAPONS BAN

Merchants, who are federally licensed to sell such weapons, would be able to dispose of their current inventory by returning them to manufacturers or selling them.

In total, the bill would ban the future sale of nearly 100 different kinds of semi-automatic pistols, shotguns and rifles, which the legislation defines as ""assault weapons.""

The National Rifle Association and other Second Amendment advocates say the legislation bans many commonly-owned rifles and goes beyond previous attempts to outlaw certain firearms.

""Not only does this tyrannical proposition infringe on the rights of all Illinois citizens, but it is also extremely dangerous,"" Gun Owners of America said in a call to action opposing the bill.

HIGHLAND PARK AND CHICAGO GUN LAWS ARE AMONG THE STRICTEST IN THE COUNTRY

""These commonly owned semi-automatic firearms are used countless times every year to save lives and deter crime. Banning them will only prevent law-abiding citizens from purchasing the best firearm to defend themselves. Not to mention, the requirement to register currently owned firearms is vehemently unconstitutional,"" the group argued.

The Illinois State Rifle Association said a more apt title for the bill would be, ""bending and ignoring the constitution in an effort to take away your Second Amendment rights to bear arms in Illinois."" The group has said it will take legal action if the bill becomes law.

BIDEN PITCHES BANNING ASSAULT WEAPONS AT DEM FUNDRAISER: 'I DON’T KNOW MANY DEER WEARING KEVLAR VESTS'

A ban on semiautomatic weapons was a campaign priority for Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, particularly after a gunman killed seven people and injured 30 others in a July 4th parade shooting in the Chicago suburb of Highland Park.

Republican lawmakers were opposed to the bill, but were overwhelmingly outnumbered in the 34-20 vote Monday. State Sen. Darren Bailey, a former GOP candidate for governor, predicted the Illinois Supreme Court would find the measure unconstitutional and said he and ""millions of other gun owners in this state will not comply.""

Harmon welcomed challenges to the law in remarks on the state Senate floor Monday.

""The weapons on this list are designed to do one thing and one thing only: kill people in a horribly brutal, vicious way,"" he said, adding, ""we'll see you in court.""

Senate votes to advance bipartisan gun control legislation,"The U.S. Senate voted Tuesday to advance a new bipartisan gun control bill in a procedural move that saw 14 Republicans support firearm restrictions.

The 64 to 34 vote was a crucial step in potentially passing the legislation, signaling that it may eclipse the 60-vote threshold needed to break a filibuster in the Senate when the bill comes up for an official vote. The bill would need the backing of 10 Republicans and all Senate Democrats to avoid a filibuster.

If the Senate breaks a filibuster, the bill would then be put up for a final passage vote. From there, the House would have to vote on the legislation before it can land on President Biden's desk.

The 80-page bill was released Tuesday evening and includes expanded background checks for gun buyers under 21, provides grants for states that implement their own red flag laws and offers additional funding for both school safety measures and mental health services.

GUN BILL DETAILS AGREED TO BY BIPARTISAN GROUP OF FOUR KEY SENATE NEGOTIATORS

The measure also creates penalties for straw purchases of firearms, requires more gun sellers to register as Federally Licensed Firearm Dealers and closes the so-called boyfriend loophole by prohibiting gun access for people convicted of domestic abuse against an intimate partner.

GOVERNOR OF RHODE ISLAND TO SIGN 3 GUN CONTROL BILLS

The bill follows a bipartisan framework from earlier this month that 10 Republican senators had already signed on to. That framework on gun control measures was the basis of Tuesday's legislation.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, the bill's lead GOP negotiator, both voted in favor of the legislation proceeding.

""I support the bill text that Sen. Cornyn and our colleagues have produced,"" McConnell said in a statement Tuesday evening.

Senate passes bipartisan gun control bill,"The Senate passed a bipartisan gun bill late Thursday night in a 65-33 vote.

The bill, spearheaded by Sens. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., and John Cornyn, R-Texas, comes in the wake of several recent mass shootings. The mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, which left 19 children and two teachers dead, was the major driver behind the bipartisan effort.

""I am proud that after weeks of hard work, the Senate passed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, a bill I negotiated with my colleagues,"" Cornyn said. ""Our bill will save lives while placing no new restrictions on law-abiding gun owners.""

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said the bill was the first major gun safety legislation to be passed since the Brady Bill in 1994.

SUPREME COURT DROPS BIG DECISION FOR GUN RIGHTS

""Tonight, the United States Senate is doing something many believed was impossible even a few weeks ago: we are passing the first significant gun safety bill in nearly 30 years,"" he said in a statement. ""The gun safety bill we are passing tonight can be described with three adjectives: bipartisan, commonsense, lifesaving.""

NEW POLL: MAJORITY OF AMERICANS SAY GUN POLICIES ‘EXTREMELY IMPORTANT’ TO MIDTERM VOTE

The bill would provide funding for states to create programs that could keep weapons away from people who are a danger to themselves or others, often called red flag laws. It would also enhance background checks for gun buyers under 21, add penalties for some gun criminals and provide funding for a variety of health and mental health-related programs.

It also addresses closing the so-called ""boyfriend loophole,"" which is a gap in federal law that means spousal domestic abusers can have gun rights taken away but not unmarried ones.

President Biden in a statement after the bill's passage said that after 28 years of ""inaction, bipartisan members of Congress came together to heed the call of families across the country and passed legislation to address the scourge of gun violence in our communities. Families in Uvalde and Buffalo - and too many tragic shootings before - have demanded action. And tonight, we acted.

""This bipartisan legislation will help protect Americans. Kids in schools and communities will be safer because of it. The House of Representatives should promptly vote on this bipartisan bill and send it to my desk.""

TEXAS UNLIKELY TO BUDGE ON RED FLAG LAWS DESPITE UVALDE SHOOTING, FEDERAL GUN CONTROL BILL: REPORT

All 48 Democrats and two Independents voted for the bill along with 15 Republicans.

The Republicans who joined Democrats in voting for the bill were Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Sens. Richard Burr of North Carolina, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Susan Collins of Maine, John Cornyn of Texas, Joni Ernst of Iowa, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Rob Portman of Ohio, Mitt Romney of Utah, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, Todd Young of Indiana, and Roy Blunt of Missouri.

""The legislation that Senator Cornyn and our colleagues assembled protects the Second Amendment,"" McConnell said in a statement. ""There are no new bans, mandates, or waiting periods for law-abiding citizens of any age. What the bill does contain are commonsense solutions that are overwhelmingly popular with lawful gun owners, such as adding juvenile criminal records and mental health issues into the background check system. It also provides significant new funding for mental health in schools.""

Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee took to Twitter to say the bill would erode Americans' constitutional right to bear arms.

""Enhanced funding for school security & mental health treatment is a good thing — but it’s being combined with giving the left a foothold to limit the 2nd Amendment."" Blackburn tweeted. ""I voted against the gun control bill because Americans' constitutional right to keep & bear arms is not negotiable.""

Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, wrote on Twitter, ""It's common sense. If we want to keep our kids safe, do not disarm law-abiding citizens. Instead, put criminals in jail and have police officers on campus to protect our kids.""

The bill now heads back to the House. President Biden has said he intends to sign it if passed.

House GOP Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., announced early Wednesday that he would formally whip his members against the bill.

""In an effort to slowly chip away at law-abiding citizens’ 2nd Amendment rights, this legislation takes the wrong approach in attempting to curb violent crimes,"" Scalise said in a whip notice Wednesday.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi put out a statement saying, ""On behalf of the House, we applaud the Senate for passing its gun violence prevention package on a strong bipartisan vote.""

She said, ""Every day, gun violence steals lives and scars communities — and this crisis demands urgent action. While we must do more, the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act is a step forward that will help protect our children and save lives.""

She said the Rules Committee would meet ""first thing"" Friday morning to advance the legislation to the House floor.

Supreme Court gun decision shoots down NY rule that set high bar for concealed carry licenses,"The Supreme Court Thursday ruled 6-3 that New York’s regulations that made it difficult to obtain a license to carry a concealed handgun were unconstitutionally restrictive, and that it should be easier to obtain such a license.

The existing standard required an applicant to show ""proper cause"" for seeking a license, and allowed New York officials to exercise discretion in determining whether a person has shown a good enough reason for needing to carry a firearm. Stating that one wished to protect themselves or their property was not enough.

""In this case, petitioners and respondents agree that ordinary, law-abiding citizens have a similar right to carry handguns publicly for their self-defense. We too agree, and now hold, consistent with Heller and McDonald, that the Second and Fourteenth Amendments protect an individual’s right to carry a handgun for self-defense outside the home,"" Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in the Court's opinion, referencing two previous gun cases. ""Because the State of New York issues public-carry licenses only when an applicant demonstrates a special need for self-defense, we conclude that the State’s licensing regime violates the Constitution.""

Thomas noted that the state statute does not define what ""proper cause"" means, and that courts had ruled that the standard was met by people who showed a ""special need for self-protection.""

SUPREME COURT SIGNALS IT COULD STRIKE DOWN OR LIMIT RESTRICTIVE NY GUN PERMIT LAW

""This ‘special need’ standard is demanding,"" Thomas wrote. ""For example, living or working in an area ‘noted for criminal activity’ does not suffice.""

In 43 other states, Thomas noted, authorities are required to issue licenses to applicants who meet certain requirements, and officials do not have discretion to say no due to what they believe is an insufficient need.

In a concurring opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh noted that Thursday's ruling does not prohibit states from setting requirements to obtain a carry license, and that it ""addresses only the unusual discretionary licensing regimes[.]""

The case, New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen, was the first major gun rights case before the Supreme Court in more than a decade. In the majority opinion, Thomas referenced 2010's McDonald v. City of Chicago and 2008's D.C. v. Heller in his reasoning for Thursday's ruling.

VULNERABLE DEMOCRATS HORSFORD, GOTTHEIMER EXPLAIN VOTES AGAINST BIPARTISAN SUPREME COURT SECURITY BILL

""As we stated in Heller and repeated in McDonald, ‘individual self-defense is ‘the central component’ of the Second Amendment right,’"" the justice cited. He also referenced how Heller made clear that restrictions on carrying guns in ""sensitive places"" is permissible, and how New York was wrong for arguing that it's law was merely doing just that.

""[W]e do think respondents err in their attempt to characterize New York’s proper-cause requirement as a ‘sensitive-place’ law,"" Thomas wrote, explaining that New York viewed ""sensitive places"" as anywhere ""where people typically congregate and where law-enforcement and other public-safety professionals are presumptively available.""

This definition, Thomas said, is too broad.

""Put simply, there is no historical basis for New York to effectively declare the island of Manhattan a ""sensitive place"" simply because it is crowded and protected generally by the New York City Police Department,"" he wrote.

The conservative justice also looked at the plain language of the Second Amendment, which protects the right ""to keep and bear arms."" He described keeping and bearing as two separate things, noting that Heller defines ""bear"" as ""to wear, bear, or carry."" This implies public carrying, Thomas said, because someone would not generally wear their gun in a holster at home, but would ""keep"" it somewhere.

The 63-page opinion also explored historical restrictions on carrying handguns that New York relied on. Thomas explained why they do not justify a current restriction, noting how past regulations from centuries ago focused on ""dangerous and unusual weapons,"" while handguns today are relatively commonplace. While the handgun may have been considering dangerous and unusual during colonial times, the opinion said, in modern times it is ""the quintessential self-defense weapon.""

SENATE VOTES TO ADVANCE BIPARTISAN GUN CONTROL LEGISLATION

The Court's opinion also stated that the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms should not be held to a lower standard than other constitutional rights.

""We know of no other constitutional right that an individual may exercise only after demonstrating to government officers some special need. That is not how the First Amendment works when it comes to unpopular speech or the free exercise of religion. It is not how the Sixth Amendment works when it comes to a defendant’s right to confront the witnesses against him. And it is not how the Second Amendment works when it comes to public carry for self-defense,"" Thomas wrote.

Justice Stephen Breyer wrote an impassioned dissenting opinion in which he referenced present-day fervor over gun violence, as well as recent events. Joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, Breyer cited statistics including 45,222 Americans killed by firearms in the U.S. in 2020, the number of mass shootings that have already taken place in 2022, and how gun violence is now the leading cause of death for children and adolescents.

""Many States have tried to address some of the dangers of gun violence just described by passing laws that limit, in various ways, who may purchase, carry, or use firearms of different kinds,"" Breyer wrote. ""The Court today severely burdens States’ efforts to do so.""

Justice Samuel Alito, in a concurring opinion, took issue with Breyer's references to recent shootings.

""Does the dissent think that laws like New York’s prevent or deter such atrocities? Will a person bent on carrying out a mass shooting be stopped if he knows that it is illegal to carry a handgun outside the home?"" Alito asked. ""And how does the dissent account for the fact that one of the mass shootings near the top of its list took place in Buffalo? The New York law at issue in this case obviously did not stop that perpetrator.""

Breyer recognized legitimate purposes for guns, such as sport, self-defense, or types of employment like security guards, but he said it is the responsibility of elected officials to balance ""these lawful uses against the dangers of firearms"" when crafting legislation.

Texas withdraws appeal to court order blocking gun law that banned adults under 21 from carrying firearms,"The state of Texas has withdrawn its appeal of a district court order that declared a state law preventing adults under 21 from carrying a handgun unconstitutional.

Texas Department of Public Safety Director Steven McCraw withdrew the appeal to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals without opposition Tuesday, the Firearms Policy Coalition (FPC) said. The FPC was a plaintiff in the case, along with two teenage gun owners who had challenged the Texas law.

""We applaud Texas for doing the right thing and accepting the district court’s ruling against its law prohibiting 18-to-20-year-old adults from carrying firearms in public,"" said Cody J. Wisniewski, FPC's senior attorney for constitutional litigation. ""Not only do young adults have the same constitutionally protected right to bear arms as all other adults, they are also among the reasons we have a Second Amendment, Constitution, and Country in the first place.""

FEDERAL JUDGE STRIKES DOWN CALIFORNIA'S ‘FEE-SHIFTING’ GUN CONTROL SCHEME, WHICH ECHOED TEXAS ABORTION LAW

Texas law permits gun-owning adults to obtain a license to carry their weapons in public. However, legal handgun owners under 21 were prevented from obtaining a license.

In August, a Texas court found that the age barrier was unconstitutional.

U.S. District Judge Mark Pittman ruled that the Second Amendment prevents restricting the rights of gun owners based on their age.

""Based on the Second Amendment’s text, as informed by Founding-Era history and tradition, the Court concludes that the Second Amendment protects against this prohibition."" Pittman wrote. ""Texas's statutory scheme must therefore be enjoined to the extent that law-abiding 18-to-20-year-olds are prohibited from applying for a license to carry a handgun.""

Pittman noted the Second Amendment does not contain any mention of age as a restriction, unlike other portions of the Constitution.

""To start, the Second Amendment does not mention any sort of age restriction,"" he wrote. ""This absence is notable—when the Framers meant to impose age restrictions, they did so expressly.""

VA House Republicans vote down gun control measures after recent shootings on school campuses,"Virginia House Republicans have voted down a range of bills that would have added new restrictions on firearms, including a ban on assault-style weapons, a college campus gun ban and a gun-storage bill that were priorities for Democrats.

The Thursday evening votes underscore that major action on gun laws is unlikely this year, given the divided control of the General Assembly.

On a 6-4 vote, a House Public Safety subcommittee defeated a bill from Democratic Del. Dan Helmer that would have expanded the definition of ""assault firearm"" and prohibited the import, sale, transfer, manufacture, purchase or transport of such a gun.

VA GUN CONTROL BILLS ADVANCE IN LEGISLATURE AFTER RECENT SHOOTINGS AT UNIVERSITY, ELEMENTARY CAMPUS

The subcommittee also voted down a measure from Democratic Del. Sally Hudson, who represents Charlottesville, that would have made it unlawful to carry a firearm in any building owned or operated by a public institution of higher education.

Virginia colleges already ban weapons through their administrative processes, but those policies don't carry the ""full force of law"" and leave law enforcement without the authority to enforce them, Hudson said.

A similar bill has been advancing in the Democrat-controlled Senate. The police chief of the University of Virginia, where a campus shooting in November left three football players dead and two other students injured, has testified in support of both measures. Hudson also said the measure was supported by the Virginia Association of Chiefs of Police.

Representatives for the Virginia Citizens Defense League and NRA spoke against the bill.

Det. Branden Culpepper said Crimson Tide freshman standout Brandon Miller brought a gun to the Tuscaloosa strip prior to the incident. Miles had asked Miller to bring it down, and he obliged, according to Culpepper.

Culpepper said Miller got to the scene, and Miles told Davis, ""The heat is in the hat,"" referencing the gun, per AL.com. He also said, ""There’s one in the head,"" meaning a bullet was in the firing chamber.

One of the suspects was wounded and suffered non-life-threatening injuries. Police did not specify which suspect was injured.

The altercation allegedly began with the suspects trying to talk to Harris, who was uninterested because she had a boyfriend, the man who says he fired at the suspects in self-defense.

Court records say Davis fired the deadly shots, but Miles ""intentionally caused"" Harris’ death by ""aiding and abetting by providing a firearm.""

Harris, who has a five-year-old son, was pronounced dead in the vehicle.

Miles was later dismissed from the team after being allegedly involved in the shooting. He was later ruled out the remainder of the season with an ankle injury.

NHL star Carey Price's opposition to Canadian gun bill creates stir,"Montreal Canadiens goaltender Carey Price caught flak Saturday when he opposed a proposed Canadian gun-control bill.

In an Instagram post, Price expressed support for the Canadian Coalition for Firearm Rights (CCFR) and criticized Prime Minister Justin Trudeau over the bill, which is described as a ""comprehensive strategy to address gun violence and strengthen gun laws"" in the country.

""I love my family, I love my country and I care for my neighbour,"" Price wrote in the post. ""I am not a criminal or a threat to society. What @justinpjtrudeau is trying to do is unjust. I support the @ccfr_ccdaf to keep my hunting tools. Thank you for listening to my opinion.""

Controversy erupted over Price’s support for the CCFR when the company reportedly used the promotional code ""poly"" for merchandise sales. According to Yahoo Sports, the code is believed to be a reference to the 1989 École Polytechnique massacre – a mass shooting that left 14 women dead and another 10 women injured.

Polytechnique Montreal denounced the promotional code. Tracey Wilson, a firearms right coalition spokesperson, said the code wasn’t meant to make light of the tragedy but was supposed to be meant as a response to a gun-control group’s group Twitter account called PlySeSouvient.

On Monday, Price tweeted he disagreed with the promotional code but believed in his right to own guns.

""My views are my own and I do believe in them,"" he tweeted. ""The only reason I bring up this issue is because it is what’s being brought up now and not out of disrespect to anyone. No, I did didn’t agree with the promotional code either.

""I continue to stand beside my fellow hunters and sport shooters who have legally acquired our property and use in a safe manner.""

The Montreal organization released a statement later Monday.

""On Saturday, Carey Price posted a statement in support of the CCFR’s opposition to proposed federal gun control legislation,"" the statement read. ""As previously stated, Carey was unaware of the CCFR’s recent marketing campaign nor was he aware of the unfortunate timing on his statement.

Activists sue to block Oregon gun control law,"A gun rights group, sheriff and gun store owner filed an emergency motion in federal court late Wednesday seeking to stop enforcement of one of the strictest gun control laws in the nation.

The gun control measure narrowly approved by Oregon voters is set go into effect on Dec. 8. U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut on Thursday scheduled a hearing on the motion for Dec. 2. The state has until next Wednesday to file a response to the emergency motion for preliminary injunction.

The Oregon Firearms Foundation, Sherman County Sheriff Brad Lohrey and Adam Johnson, owner of Coat of Arms Firearms, filed a federal lawsuit against the Oregon governor and attorney general on Nov. 18 saying Measure 114 is unconstitutional.

OREGON VOTERS TO DECIDE ON STRICT GUN CONTROL MEASURE: 'PEOPLE WILL NOT HAVE THE MEANS TO PROTECT THEMSELVES'

The measure requires residents to obtain a permit to purchase a gun, bans magazines that hold more than 10 rounds except in some circumstances and creates a statewide firearms database.

""Banning magazines over 10 rounds is no more likely to reduce criminal abuse of guns then banning high horsepower engines is likely to reduce criminal abuse of automobiles,"" the lawsuit said. ""To the contrary, the only thing the ban contained in 114 ensures is that a criminal unlawfully carrying a firearm with a magazine over 10 rounds will have a potentially devastating advantage over his law-abiding victim.""

OREGON SHERIFFS WON'T ENFORCE NEW GUN LAW: ‘INFRINGES ON SECOND AMENDMENT’

Measure 114 backers argued that banning large-capacity magazines will save lives because it would force shooters to pause to reload, which would provide an opening for others to stop the shooting. Proponents also say it would reduce suicides — which account for 82% of gun deaths in the state — mass shootings and other gun violence.

"Alex Murdaugh's lawyer, Dick Harpootlian, aims gun at prosecutors, says 'tempting'","Alex Murdaugh's defense lawyer, Dick Harpootlian, playfully aimed a rifle at the prosecution table and said ""tempting"" during a demonstration Tuesday in Walterboro, South Carolina.

Forensic engineer Mike Sutton, a defense expert, was on the stand explaining the trajectory of the shots that killed Maggie Murdaugh June 7, 2021.

With Sutton's guidance, Harpootlian was trying to show Colleton County jurors the shooter's stance when the .300 Blackout rifle was fired, but briefly pointed the weapon at prosecutors.

""Tempting,"" said Harpootlian mischievously before chuckling.

ALEX MURDAUGH: TIMELINE OF ONCE-POWERFUL SOUTH CAROLINA LAWYER'S SPECTACULAR DOWNFALL

The stunt prompted South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson, who was seated at the prosecution table, to break into in a broad smile, as the gallery erupted in laughter.

Harpootlian, who is also a Democratic state senator, quickly composed himself after the flash of levity.

MAGGIE MURDAUGH'S SISTER RECOUNTS ALEX MURDAUGH'S ‘STRANGE’ COMMENT AFTER MURDERS IN TEARFUL TESIMONY

""I don’t know how I can do this, so I’m not pointing at somebody,"" he said, before turning his back to the gallery and continuing with the demonstration in the opposite direction.

Sutton, a ballistics and acoustics expert, testified that based on the angle of the shots the shooter was likely 5 feet 2 to 5 feet 4 inches tall or crouched down in an awkward position.

Harpootlian asked Sutton to position him with the rifle in the way Murdaugh, who is 6 foot 4, would have to hold it in order to achieve the same angle.

""In my opinion, it’s very unlikely that [Murdaugh] fired that shot,"" Sutton testified. ""It puts him in an unrealistic shooting position. It’s not an aiming position. It’s not a shooting position.""

Murdaugh is accused of fatally shooting his wife, Maggie, 52, with a rifle and Paul Murdaugh, 22, with a shotgun.

Sutton also conducted a series of tests recreating the shootings at the family's sprawling 1,700-acree hunting estate known as Moselle.

ALEX MURDAUGH'S SON, PAUL, CONFRONTED HIM ABOUT ‘BAGS OF PILLS’ BEFORE DOUBLE SLAYING

Maggie and Paul were found near the property's dog kennels, about 380 yards as the crow flies from the main residence, where Murdaugh was allegedly napping during the slayings.

Sutton could barely hear the rifle when it was fired by the dog kennels while he was at the main house, and the defense played an audio recording of this experiment.

""If you’ve got the TV on, no way you could hear that shot,"" Sutton testified.

The shotgun, which is quieter, wasn't audible at all, he added.

In earlier testimony Tuesday, Murdaugh's only living son, Buster Murdaugh, testified for the defense.

'Blatantly unconstitutional': Strict gun control law faces new NRA-backed legal challenge,"One of the strictest gun control laws in the nation is facing a new National Rifle Association-backed legal challenge as a federal judge prepares to decide whether to delay the measure's implementation.

Two former Oregon lawmakers, a sporting goods store, the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF) and the Oregon State Shooting Association — the NRA's state affiliate — filed the lawsuit Thursday, arguing the voter-approved Measure 114 places ""severe and unprecedented burdens"" on those seeking to exercise their Second Amendment rights.

""Oregon’s Measure 114 is blatantly unconstitutional,"" Lawrence G. Keane, NSSF’s senior vice president and general counsel, said in a statement provided to Fox News. ""The right to keep and bear arms begins with the ability of law-abiding citizens to be able to obtain a firearm through a lawful purchase at a firearm retailer.""

HUNTERS FEAR 'END OF FIREARM SALES' UNTIL OREGON CREATES GUN PERMIT SYSTEM

Measure 114 passed with just 50.65% of the vote last month. It bans ammunition magazines capable of holding more than 10 rounds and mandates the creation of a permit-to-purchase system that includes hands-on firearm training and fingerprinting.

The measure's sponsors hope it will rein in violent crime , suicides and accidental deaths in the state.

The measure takes effect Dec. 8, at which point local police expect ""all gun sales by dealers, at gun shows and most private transfers in Oregon will immediately stop,"" according to a statement from the Oregon Association Chiefs of Police.

""Oregon has not yet even provided the necessary funding for, let alone set up the systems required to administer its new and onerous permitting scheme,"" the latest lawsuit alleges. ""As of right now, there is no firearms training course that has been certified by the state, which means that no one can lawfully obtain a permit-to-purchase.""

The suit seeks a permanent injunction against Measure 114, arguing that both the permit-to-purchase requirement and ban on magazines capable of holding more than 10 rounds violate the Second Amendment. It's the third suit filed since voters approved the measure.

California gun owners 'horrified' after state DOJ data breach exposes identities: 'Alarming situation',"California gun owners and advocates said they were left ""horrified"" after a data breach within the state’s Department of Justice exposed the personal information of thousands of gun owners who applied for a concealed carry permit over the last decade.

""We are absolutely horrified,"" Sam Paredes, executive director of the Gun Owners of California, told KCRA 3. ""The biggest concern is, now you have given a roadmap to anybody with evil intent.""

The California DOJ confirmed the data breach on Wednesday and has launched an investigation. The breach followed an update to the state’s Firearms Dashboard Portal Monday, and exposed personal information for people who were granted or denied concealed carry permits between 2011 and 2021.

""Based on the Department’s current investigation, the incident exposed the personal information of individuals who were granted or denied a concealed and carry weapons (CCW) permit between 2011-2021. The information exposed included names, date of birth, gender, race, driver’s license number, addresses, and criminal history,"" the state’s DOJ said in a statement.

GUN RIGHTS GROUP FIRES BACK AT CALIFORNIA AG'S REPORTED LEAK OF FIREARM OWNERS DATA: 'HE SHOULD RESIGN'

The breach reportedly did not expose Social Security numbers or financial information. The Reload was the first to report on the breach Tuesday and found in the LA County database that about 420 reserve officers and 244 judges were also among those who had their information leaked.

""This is an alarming situation,"" Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea, president of the California State Sheriffs’ Association, told KCRA 3.

""At the end of the day, I think that there's been a real loss of peace of mind on the part of many law-abiding citizens,"" Honea added. ""Now, they have to be concerned about falling into the wrong hands and being used in a way that causes them harm.""

Paredes told Fox News on Wednesday that Attorney General Rob Bonta should resign over the leak, arguing he ""is either massively incompetent, incredibly negligent, or willing to criminally leak information that he does not have the authority to leak.""

""This is so egregious that he should resign. He has placed tens of thousands of abiding citizens in California in harms way. That is not excusable with an 'I'm sorry,’"" Paredes continued.

It is unclear how many people saw their personal information leaked, though some have said the figure is in the hundreds of thousands. The California Rifle and Pistol Association is urging people to get their state lawmakers involved with the investigation to ensure ""someone’s held accountable.""

""We're getting them to write letters to the AG, demanding a full investigation demanding that someone's held accountable, or somebodies are held accountable, and that we get to the bottom of this, and we make sure this never, ever happens again,"" California Rifle and Pistol Association legislative director Rick Travis told KCRA 3.

The group added in comment to The Reload that they are exploring taking potential legal action against the state.

The Attorney General’s office directed Fox News Digital to Bonta's Wednesday statement when approached for comment. Bonta said in the statement that ""this unauthorized release of personal information is unacceptable.""

SUPREME COURT GUN RULING REMINDS NEW YORKERS THERE IS A RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS

I am deeply disturbed and angered,"" he said.

""Having the private data of citizens, people who have been able to get the permits … these are judges, law enforcement, domestic violence victims who were able to get that permit,"" Hochman said, according to KTLA.

This is one of the many tremendous failings of the Attorney General and his office. The fact they tried to quickly tried to take it off didn’t erase the error.

"Feds announce major NYC gun trafficking, fentanyl bust after alleged dealers caught on cam by undercover cops","Federal prosecutors announced a major New York City gun and drug trafficking bust involving four defendants caught on camera allegedly selling firearms to undercover NYPD officers.

A seven-count indictment charges defendants David Mccann and Tajhai Jones, both 28, Raymond Minaya, 26, and Calvin Tabron, 25, with allegedly conspiring to illegally traffic more than 50 firearms. Mccann and Minaya are also charged with conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute cocaine base.

Mccann is additionally charged with conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute fentanyl. He allegedly introduced thousands of potentially fatal doses into the community.

At a press conference Wednesday, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York Breon Peace said the case was one of the first prosecutions in the nation – and the first unsealed indictment in New York – under the bipartisan SAFER Communities Act. Among other reforms designed to bolster school safety, the legislation signed into law in June by President Joe Biden made federal straw purchasing and trafficking criminal offenses, allowing prosecutors to target dangerous illegal gunrunners.

CANADA POLICE ID TORONTO HOMELESS MAN, 59, ALLEGEDLY MURDERED BY 8 TEEN GIRLS IN ‘SWARMING’ ATTACK

Among other provisions, it creates a standalone firearm trafficking conspiracy offense, which the government has charged in this case to hold accountable those who conspire to illegally sell firearms. The act provides for sentences of up to 15 years imprisonment.

The defendants engaged in multiple transactions involving the sale of at least 50 illegal firearms in Brooklyn between January 2022 and August 2022, prosecutors said.

They allegedly sold these firearms in broad daylight from vehicles in and around New York City Housing Authority’s Breukelen Houses, which are located across the street from a church and blocks away from a preschool and grade school in the Canarsie neighborhood in Brooklyn. They would often carry the guns they trafficked in whatever they could find, including gloves and shopping bags, prosecutors said. Two members of the gun-trafficking operation obtained the firearms in Virginia and then transported them to New York to be sold on the streets of Brooklyn.

Some of the firearms had defaced serial numbers or were made from ghost gun kits, making them harder for law enforcement to trace, Peace said.

The defendants sold the guns and drugs to an undercover officer who recorded many of the transactions, according to the indictment. The undercover officer told the defendants that he was a drug dealer who needed guns and that he was also going to resell some of the guns that were provided to him.

Despite this knowledge, the conspirators continued to sell large quantities of drugs and guns to the undercover officer without hesitation, prosecutors said.

Law enforcement have linked the firearms sold in the conspiracy to several shootings in Brooklyn.

On June 22, 2022, Minaya allegedly sold an undercover officer a Glock 30 .45-caliber handgun. The investigation revealed that this gun was used in an Aug. 16, 2021, shooting in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood, where armed perpetrators shot into a large crowd gathered for a family day celebration. In total, eight people were struck by gunfire.

Another gun allegedly trafficked by the conspirators – a Glock 43 9mm handgun – was linked to a Dec. 18, 2021, shooting of a person in Canarsie, in the blocks surrounding the Breukelen Houses complex. That victim sustained multiple gunshot wounds to his body, including his right hand, shoulder, neck and the base of his skull.

When agents arrested Minaya in Brooklyn on Wednesday morning, he was in illegal possession of two handguns, including one with an extended magazine, prosecutors said. He allegedly threw one of the guns out a window in an attempt to hide it, though both guns were recovered.

""As alleged, the defendants are responsible for attempting to flood the streets of Brooklyn with over 50 deadly weapons, including ghost guns, as well as narcotics, feeding the cycles of gun violence and drug abuse,"" Peace said in a statement.

'BLATANTLY UNCONSTITUTIONAL': STRICT GUN CONTROL LAW FACES NEW NRA-BACKED LEGAL CHALLENGE

Measure 114 passed with 50.65% of the vote last month. It bans ammunition magazines capable of holding more than 10 rounds and mandates the creation of a permit-to-purchase system that includes fingerprinting and hands-on firearm training from an instructor who has been certified by law enforcement. The permits can cost up to $65 under the measure and last for five years with a new background check required for each gun purchase.

Judge Karin J. Immergut heard more than two hours of arguments Friday relating to the first lawsuit filed against the measure by the Oregon Firearms Federation, Sherman County Sheriff Brad Lohrey and a gun store owner. The suit alleges that both the magazine capacity limit and permit-to-purchase requirement violate the Second Amendment.

The measure's sponsors hope it will reduce violent crime , accidental deaths and suicides. Senior Assistant Attorney General Brian Simmonds Marshall argued in court documents that delaying the bill's start date would ""likely result in unnecessary deaths"" and hinder Oregon's efforts to ""reduce the risk of a massacre within its borders.""

Immergut expects to make a decision early this week on whether the law should be delayed, according to Oregonian reporter Maxine Bernstein.

OREGON SHERIFFS WON'T ENFORCE NEW GUN LAW: ‘INFRINGES ON SECOND AMENDMENT’

There is much confusion over what will happen when the law takes effect Dec. 8. Gun store owners and local police have said the permit system will not be ready in time, but Oregon State Police tried to assuage those fears Friday afternoon in a press release that stated there would be a ""manual paper process until new technical systems can be designed and implemented.""

""If there is not an injunction before the morning of the eighth, that will mean there will be no gun sales on the eighth to Oregonians,"" Durkheimer said prior to OSP's release.

He expected it could take a full year for sales to resume because OSP initially predicted the permit-to-purchase system wouldn't begin until around January 2024, according to a fiscal estimate prepared earlier this year by a state committee.

Fortunately for Northwest Armory, gross sales since Nov. 8 are the largest they've had in three decades of business as customers rush to buy guns and magazines before the ban takes effect, Durkheimer said.

OSP's background check unit has seen ""unprecedented volumes of firearms transactions"" in the past month. State police received about 849 background check requests a day prior to the election, but that average skyrocketed to 4,092 requests per day immediately after voters approved Measure 114.

"Suspects in Georgia gun shop robbery, triple murder mystery likely knew victims, ex-ATF agent says","A small town Georgia community rocked by the triple homicide of a local gun shop owner, his elderly wife and their teenage grandson is still reeling, as authorities still have not publicly identified any suspects Monday in what’s believed to be an armed robbery during which as many as 40 guns were stolen.

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), the City of Grantville, Georgia, and the National Shooting Sports Foundation is offering a $15,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible for the triple murder that happened between 5:30 and 6 p.m. Friday at Lock, Stock and Barrel Shooting Range, a federal firearms licensee about 50 miles southwest of Atlanta.

The owner, 75-year-old Thomas Richard Hawk Sr., his 75-year-old wife, Evelyn Hawk, and their 17-year-old grandson, Luke Hawk, who was helping his grandparents close up shop while on spring break from high school, were murdered in what authorities said was an armed robbery. The Grantville Police Department said approximately 40 weapons and the shop’s camera DVR were taken from the scene.

USPS STOPS DELIVERIES TO CALIFORNIA NEIGHBORHOOD AFTER REPEATED ATTACKS ON MAIL CARRIERS: REPORT

Scott Sweetow, a former Special Agent in Charge of the ATF's Atlanta Division, speculated that the suspect or suspects knew the owner or were at least familiar with the shop, noting that although after-hours burglaries at gun shops are common, robberies are not because thieves usually are careful to make sure everyone is out of the shop first knowing that staff would probably be better armed.

""One of the things that we find historically when looking at guns for burglaries is that people know what they're targeting,"" he told WXIA-TV. ""It would not surprise me at all that once this is solved, and it will be solved, that the people were either familiar with the location because they have been in there multiple times or they had some other sort of inside knowledge about what was going on inside that store.""

""You would be astounded just how quickly guns that are stolen from burglaries end up on the street and are often used in crimes,"" Sweetow added.

As of Sunday evening, Grantville police chief Steve Whitlock told WMAZ that no suspects had been identified and no video evidence had been recovered. Flowers and crime scene tape remained at the scene.

""To think that we have animals like that living in our community blows my mind,"" Mike Menese, a friend of the gun shop owner, who ran the business for more than 30 years, told Fox 5 Atlanta. ""I lost someone that I knew very well that brought a lot of joy to my life and my family's life.""

""How can you hurt someone like that? How can you do that? It’s a sweet old man,"" he said, adding a warning for those responsible. ""I don’t know if the criminals are watching the news, but I hope they are running because they are going to catch them. And I hope they do soon.""

Whitlock, serving the town of just 3,200 people, said he was taking the news pretty hard.

""I’ve been here eight years, and we’ve never had anything like this,"" Whitlock told WSB-TV in a separate interview Saturday morning. ""Right now, I’m just speechless. I have a hard time talking about it because they were friends of ours. I’ve known them for a long time.""

""It’s really hard because we don’t have stuff like this here in Grantville. This is a nice, quiet little town,"" the police chief said, explaining he last saw the couple Tuesday and law enforcement usually stopped at the shop at least once or twice a week. ""Tommy would do anything for anybody. It’s just a nice family. It’s been really hard.""

The senior-citizen-age couple’s son, Richard Hawk, who works as the coroner for Coweta County, was reportedly the one to discover the bodies around 8 p.m. Friday and called police. He’s the father of Luke, who was supposed to graduate high school in May, according to a GoFundMe page set up by the family.

In an emotional message shared to Facebook on Saturday, Coweta County Sheriff Lenn Wood said that the ""Hawk Family, the City of Grantville, and the Coweta Community were forever broken and changed by the senseless and tragic event that happened in Grantville.""

Wood described Thomas Hawk as ""a committed public servant"" and a ""personal friend of mine,"" who had ""served faithfully for decades in our law enforcement community.""

Experts slam NYT's claim legal gun sales partly to blame for rapid increase in violent crime,"Violent crimes like murders have plagued the U.S. over the last two years, and many experts blame the fallout from the pandemic and 2020’s summer of protests and riots following the death of George Floyd.

The New York Times recently argued that 2020’s skyrocketing increase in legal gun purchases has also contributed to the spikes, an explanation experts are pouring cold water on.

""First off, let's go back 30 years,"" the Heritage Foundation’s Charles Stimson told Fox News Digital in a phone interview this month. ""For the last 27, 29 years, our country has had a dramatic decrease in violent crime. Violent crime peaked in 1992-93, and it has been on the wane ever since then — until recently.

""That and that alone rebuts [The New York Times’] argument that increased legal gun ownership has contributed to this spike in crime. What, they didn't do it for 30 years? Even though they bought tens of millions of guns between 92 and now.""

Stimson was reacting to an April 17 piece published by The New York Times detailing the increase in violence seen in the U.S. since 2020. The article attributed three reasons to help explain the increase in violence, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the disruption to daily life it brought, as well as the ""high-profile police killings of 2020 and the protests that followed.""

""And Americans bought a record number of guns in recent years."" the article stated as the third explanation.

Gun sales had a banner year in 2020, with an estimated 23 million firearms sold and more than 21 million gun background checks conducted. The numbers smashed records, and notably spiked at the onset of the pandemic in March, before jumping yet again in June of that year as protests and riots spread across the nation in response to the death of George Floyd.

MORE THAN 23M FIREARMS SOLD, OVER 21M GUN BACKGROUND CHECKS CONDUCTED IN 2020

""The guns that Americans bought remain in circulation. While COVID cases have plummeted and lockdowns have ended, new variants are still disrupting social services and life in general,"" The New York Times story states.

The argument that more gun purchases contributed to the murder spike was also floated by The Atlantic earlier this year, but experts at the Heritage Foundation explained that correlation is not causation.

""The short answer is that there is absolutely no statistical evidence to that effect showing some causal relationship"" between the increase in gun purchases and increase in violent crimes, the Heritage Foundation’s Amy Swearer told Fox News Digital.

MASSIVE INCREASE IN BLACK AMERICANS MURDERED WAS RESULT OF DEFUND POLICE MOVEMENT: EXPERTS

Swearer explained that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives traced the highest number of guns that year and added that ""the ​​overall number of short ‘time-to-crime’ guns traced increased in 2020."" Time-to-crime refers to the time period between the first retail sale of a firearm and the recovery of the gun from a crime. The number of short ""time-to-crime"" guns recovered nearly doubled in 2020 compared to 2019.

Swearer directed Fox News Digital to an article published by FiveThirtyEight and The Trace in late 2021, which detailed that law enforcement officials typically view shorter time-to-crime windows as indicative a gun was purchased with criminal intent.

What’s important to note, Swearer said, is that though the number of short time-to-crime guns recovered increased, the size of the increase was not abnormal and ""the overall percentage did not"" increase compared to previous trends.

Dr. Garen Wintemute of the Violence Prevention Research Program at UC Davis investigated a possible relationship between 2020's gun sales and the increase in crime and found none.

""Instead, [researchers] concluded that unemployment, economic disparity and physical distancing exacerbated by the pandemic were far more potent predictors of increased violence,"" the FiveThirtyEight article notes.

Another expert, Julia Schleimer, a researcher in the Violence Prevention Research Program at the University of California, Davis, said that the gun sale surge ""may have contributed to a surge in crime."" But she noted that it’s also possible ""that the increase in gun sales is not solely responsible for the increase in short time-to-crime recoveries.""

Swearer said the pandemic and lockdowns had many Americans questioning, for the first time, if they could protect themselves, leading to the gun sales increase.

""A lot of people were looking around, especially early on, and getting that first sense … of ‘I actually don't know that if something happens the government will be there to protect me,’"" Swearer said. She noted that the pandemic prompted police departments to change policies in how to respond to emergency calls and response times lagged as a result.

She explained that this triggered many people who had not previously owned a gun, such as women and minorities, to purchase a firearm. Similar to Stimson, Swearer pointed to America’s history of gun ownership and said that it’s not as if before the pandemic the U.S. have ""restrictive gun ownership laws.""

""There were prior to that, still 400 million privately owned guns, a thriving black market for criminal guns all before the pandemic. In the years leading up to 2020's crime spike, Americans were buying on average well over a million guns a month,"" she said.

Fox News Digital reached out to The New York Times for data backing up the argument that increased gun sales contributed to the crime surge and was directed to The Trace’s data. A previous article from The New York Times on the surging violence also pointed to a Harvard study that found where there are more firearms, there are more gun crimes.

The Trace’s data shows gun sales spiked at the start of the pandemic with nearly 2 million guns sold, then spiked again in June 2020 as protests and riots spread across the nation in response to Floyd’s killing, resulting in about 2.5 million guns sold. Another spike was seen in January 2021, at more than 2.4 million guns sold, when the Capitol insurrection unfolded and as President Biden took office.

US MURDER RATE HIGHEST IT'S BEEN IN 25 YEARS AS BIG CITIES SHATTER RECORDS

Stimson told Fox News Digital that the ""idea that this spike in crime has anything to do with legal purchases of weapons or people exercising their Second Amendment rights is hogwash.""

""Any prosecutor, defense lawyer, judge — and I've been all three — will tell you that the vast majority of violent crimes are not committed by people who lawfully purchased their guns. They have burner guns, they buy guns on the street, they steal guns. They're not going to the gun show with their kids and their wife and their Labrador retriever, with their red white and blue flag on their car,"" he said.

Stimson said ""the left’s focus on trying to reduce the number of guns"" is a ""head fake to focus your attention on the inanimate object, as opposed to figuring out how to hold the criminal accountable at every stage of the criminal justice process.""

""Guns are inanimate objects. Just like hammers, just like a knife, just like a rope, just like a throwing star,"" he said. ""There is not one gun that has committed a crime in this country. There are criminals.""

Murders skyrocketed by nearly 30% in 2020 compared to the year prior and disproportionately affected the Black community. Black murders spiked by 32% that year compared to 2019 and by 43% when compared to the prior 10-year average, according to FBI data previously reported by Fox News Digital.

FBI DATA SHOWS LARGE INCREASE IN MURDERS IN 2020 NATIONWIDE

Estimates show murders in 2021 remained high, at about 6.9 murders per 100,000 people that year. Major cities across the nation reported an increase in murders, including Chicago, New York , Los Angeles, and Minneapolis . Experts Fox News Digital previously spoke to explained that the protests and riots of the summer of 2020 and the ""Ferguson Effect"" contributed to the spike in violence that year.

""Certainly, the protests and riots mid-2020 after the death of George Floyd followed a pattern of spiking violence that we've seen following past viral police incidents, such as the deaths of Michael Brown and Freddie Gray. This pattern has been termed the ‘Ferguson Effect’ — police pull back while violent crime spikes precipitously,"" Hannah Meyers, director of the policing and public safety initiative at the Manhattan Institute, previously told Fox News Digital.

The Ferguson Effect was first coined in November 2014 and gained widespread attention in 2016 after the Manhattan Institute’s Heather Mac Donald wrote an opinion piece for The Wall Street Journal arguing the effect is one ""where the Black Lives Matter narrative about racist, homicidal cops has produced virulent hostility in the streets."" Mac Donald told Fox News Digital that the spike of 2020 was due to Black Lives Matter and defund the police movements that swept the nation, not the pandemic.

Stimson agreed that it's ""false"" to say that crime increased ""as a result of COVID,"" and pointed to ""rogue"" prosecutors in certain areas of the country and defunding the police rhetoric.

""It is where you have the toxic trio of defund the police, or rhetoric about defunding the police demoralizing the police ... And then the elections of these rogue prosecutors who enact pro-criminal, anti-victim policies. In those cities, violent crime has gone up. Lots of crime has gone up. And they are panicking because now it's very clear that is their policies,"" Stimson said.",https://www.foxnews.com/us/increase-gun-sales-2020-increase-violent-crimes-experts,N/A
Indiana man arrested after video showed young child playing with gun,"An Indiana man was arrested over the weekend after a boy, reportedly his son, was seen wielding and pointing a gun outside their apartment unit.

Shane Osborne, 45, a resident of the Indianapolis suburb of Beech Grove, faces a charge of felony neglect of a child dependent. The arrest was captured on the reality TV show called ""On Patrol: Live,"" which follows law enforcement officers on duty.

Authorities responded Saturday to a 911 call made by a neighbor in the apartment building where the child was holding the weapon in a hallway.

VIDEO SHOWS UTAH CHILD, 4, SHOOT AT POLICE OUTSIDE MCDONALD'S DRIVE-THRU

The boy, who was not named, appears to be waving the gun and pulling the trigger. No rounds were in the gun's chamber, police said. He did not appear to be harmed.

""It's almost incomprehensible what you're watching,"" said Beech Grove Deputy Police Chief Robert Mercuri. ""I saw it the next day and even though I knew the outcome, as I'm watching the video, I was still scared. You find yourself catching your breath. I don't know how you can't watch that video, parent or non-parent and not be shocked and disturbed.""

When questioned by police, Osborne allegedly said he did not have a gun. However, when officers looked at home surveillance video provided by a neighbor, the child was allegedly seen in a hallway alone playing with a weapon, the TV series said in a news release.

""Watching that video, ohhhh, you can't, you can't unsee it,"" neighbor Nicole Summers told WTHR-TV. ""He just kept going, 'pow, pow, pow, pow.'""

Authorities seized a semiautomatic Smith & Wesson 9mm pistol from Osborne and he was taken into custody, Fox 59 reported.

A magazine was also taken, which had 15 rounds inside and the child was returned to his mother.

""I received notification from our Police Chief soon after this incident took place,"" he said in a statement, WTHR-TV reported. ""As with all of you, I'm mortified and what took place and I'm so thankful that no one was hurt, especially the young child.""

"Louisville activist arrested for attempted murder of mayoral candidate pushed socialism, gun control","The suspect charged in Monday’s targeted shooting of Louisville, Kentucky, mayoral candidate Craig Greenberg has been identified as an activist for civil rights and gun control.

Quintez Brown, 21, was charged with attempted murder and four counts of wanton endangerment, the Louisville Metro Police Department confirmed to Fox News Digital.

Brown previously worked for the Louisville Courier Journal as an intern and an editorial columnist, according to the newspaper. In December, Brown shared a short campaign video on Twitter announcing that he was running to represent District 5 for Louisville’s Metro Council in 2022. His writing advocates for the ideals of communism, socialism, liberation and has criticized ""gun-loving"" Republicans.

As a freshman in college, Brown also reportedly was selected to meet former President Obama.

LOUISVILLE MAYORAL CANDIDATE CRAIG GREENBERG TARGETED IN SHOOTING, POLICE SAY

Greenberg is a Democrat, and police have not provided details about the possible motive for the shooting.

The Louisville Metro Police Department responded around 10:15 a.m. Monday after multiple shots were fired at Greenberg’s campaign headquarters in Butchertown. Investigators say Greenberg was not struck and no one else was injured.

Police said an article of clothing Greenberg was wearing was struck, and the candidate said his sweater was grazed by a bullet. Greenberg said the suspect had walked into the campaign office, pulled out a gun, ""aimed directly at me and began shooting.""

""Today is not a day for politics, but it’s not lost on me that the violence my staff and I experienced today is far too common in our city,"" Greenberg said, also thanking the Louisville Metro Police. ""Too many Louisville families have experienced the trauma of gun violence. Too many aren't as blessed as me.""

The arrest report, obtained by Fox News, said a man later identified as Brown entered the building and fired a 9mm Glock handgun at Greenberg. He then fled the building. About 10 minutes later, officers located a man matching the suspect description less than a half-mile away. He was found carrying a loaded 9mm magazine in his pants pocket and was taken into custody, the arrest report says.

Surveillance video reportedly captured the incident.

Brown is a civil rights activist who reportedly participated in 2020 racial justice demonstrations.

In his Twitter bio, he says, ""We have one scientific and correct solution, Pan-Africanism: the total liberation and unification of Africa under scientific socialism.""

In a Feb. 1 post on Instagram, Brown, using the handle ""tez4liberation,"" shared a post celebrating ""Black Radical Month"" and a list of names that included convicted cop killer Assata Shakur.

Last month, Brown published a piece on Medium.com on Jan. 10 titled, ""A Revolutionary Love Letter.""

""During our short stay on this glorious planet we all have been collectively dehumanized and reduced to political talking points — Black, white, liberal, conservative, Christian, criminal, boss, worker, activist, etc.,"" Brown wrote in the letter. ""Our sick, manipulated brethren will weaponize common sense and tell us to ‘face to facts’ — as if facts are something outside of us as if life were something we encounter as foreigners*. They will tell us that communism and collectivism has never and will never work and refuse to even explore these ""childish"" (or inferior) ideas.""

Screenshots shared online show Brown wrote one piece for the Courier-Journal published on July 2, 2019, titled, ""Kentucky’s concealed carry law shows your life doesn’t matter to gun-loving Republicans.""

As a freshman political science major at University of Louisville, Brown was one of 22 students in the country invited to the inaugural national gathering of the Obama Foundation’s My Brother’s Keeper Alliance that supports boys and young men of color. He traveled to Oakland, California, and was quoted as saying he had the opportunity to shake hands with Obama himself during a two-day workshop.

In 2018, Brown was featured in an MSNBC segment covering students participating in ""March For Our Lives"" protests in Washington, D.C., demanding stricter gun laws.

The 17-year-old president of the Black Student Union at duPont Manual High School in Louisville at the time, Brown sat down with MSNBC host Joy Reid in the nation’s capital.

Addressing Kentucky Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell, who was the Senate majority leader at the time, Brown said students want Congress to act on guns, ""and if you’re not going to give us that, then we’re going to get everyone out here to vote, and we’re going to vote you out of office.""

""Get rid of assault rifles,"" Brown said.

Brown also made headlines last summer when his family reported him missing. He was found safe on July 1, about two weeks after vanishing, and his family subsequently asked for privacy and patience ""while we tend to the most immediate need, which is Quintez's physical, mental and spiritual needs.""

New York ‘gun free’ zones go into effect,"A federal judge let a sweeping New York gun law move forward Wednesday night hours before the regulations took effect.

Judge Glenn Suddaby said the plaintiffs — including gun rights organizations and an upstate resident — did not have standing to bring the legal action.

The judge noted that the legal gun owner could not demonstrate that he was at risk of a credible threat of prosecution under the new guidelines.

New York Attorney General Letitia James tweeted that the ruling was a major victory ""against baseless attacks by the gun lobby.""

NEW YORK LEGISLATION DESIGNATES TIMES SQUARE A 'GUN FREE' ZONE

""This law will take effect tomorrow. We will continue to defend the constitutionality of our laws to protect New Yorkers from gun violence,"" she said.

""Responsible gun control measures save lives. As gun violence continues to impact communities across the country, any attempts by the gun lobby to tear down New York’s sensible gun control laws will be met with fierce defense of the law,"" James added in a follow-up tweet.

Erich Pratt, senior vice president of Gun Owners of America, one of the groups that filed the challenge, told The Associated Press that Suddaby’s opinion ""contains a silver lining for New Yorkers and the nation"" and said his group would continue to fight ""against clear violations of the Second Amendment.""

Signs were posted in New York City's Times Square declaring it a ""Gun Free Zone.""

Times Square, along with parks, churches and theaters, are just some of the ""sensitive"" places that will be off-limits for guns.

The measure was passed following a June Supreme Court decision in NYSRPA v. Bruen that expanded gun rights.

It also sets strict standards for issuing concealed carry permits.

The law requires that applicants for a permit complete 16 hours of classroom training, two hours of live-fire exercises and provide a list of social media accounts over the past three years as part of a ""character and conduct"" review.

Renewal or recertification of permits is required every three years.

There were reports of long lines at county clerks' offices and surges in applications before the law took effect.

""In response to the Supreme Court's decision to strike down New York's century-old concealed carry law, we took swift and thoughtful action to keep New Yorkers safe,"" New York Gov.

""Defendants-Appellants seek a stay pending appeal, and an emergency interim stay, of the preliminary injunction issued by the district court on November 7, 2022,"" Tuesday's ruling states. ""IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that a temporary stay is granted pending the panel’s consideration of the motion.""

STRICT GUN BILL ON OREGON BALLOT WILL CAUSE 'GREATER RISK OF VIOLENCE,' HARMFUL TO PUBLIC SAFETY, CRITICS WARN

On Nov. 7, District Court Judge Glenn Suddaby said New York's conceal carry law invoked ""unprecedented constitutional violations"" and granted a partial preliminary injunction in favor of Gun Owners of America (GOA), forcing the state to cease enforcement of parts of the law, which was signed by Gov. Kathy Hochul in July.

Suddaby ruled the state can still prevent people from carrying guns in Times Square, public playgrounds, libraries, nurseries and preschools. However, mental hospitals, places of worship, public parks, zoos, theaters, conference centers, protests and bars were no longer off limits for people with a concealed carry permit.

Tuesday's ruling blocks Suddaby's order.

""New York has once again defied the Constitution and the Supreme Court’s Bruen decision,"" GOA Senior Vice President Erich Pratt said in response to Tuesday's ruling.

NRA challenges Illinois semiautomatic gun ban in court: 'Blatant violation' of Second Amendment rights,"EXCLUSIVE — The National Rifle Association (NRA) filed a lawsuit Tuesday against the state of Illinois over its recent gun control law that the group says is ""unconstitutional"" and a ""blatant violation"" of constitutional rights.

""The NRA will not stand by while activist politicians pass unconstitutional laws that do nothing to promote public safety. We sued the state of Illinois because this new law is a blatant violation of Americans’ Second Amendment rights,"" Jason Ouimet, executive director of the NRA Institute for Legislative Action (NRA-ILA), told Fox News Digital.

The Illinois Senate passed its version of the Protect Illinois Communities Act earlier this month, banning so-called assault weapons and high-capacity magazines from being manufactured or sold in the state.

Gov. J.B. Pritzker then signed the bill into law, prohibiting the manufacture and sale of semiautomatic rifles and pistols, .50-caliber guns, as well as attachments that can increase a gun’s fire rate. The law also requires residents to register their banned firearms.

""The Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that the Second Amendment protects firearms that are in common use,"" Ouimet continued in his comment to Fox News Digital. ""AR-15s are the most popular rifle in America with millions being lawfully used every day. In fact, in 2020, more than three times as many AR-15s were sold as Ford F150s. Further, less than 2 percent of all gun crime is committed with these types of rifles. The governor signed this bill to advance a political agenda, not to protect his constituents.""

ILLINOIS GOVERNOR SLAMS SHERIFFS WHO VOWED TO DEFY GUN BAN, SAYS LAW PROTECTS SCHOOLKIDS, CHURCHGOERS

Ouimet was citing a federal judge in California who ruled in 2021 that California's ban on so-called assault weapons was unconstitutional and that F-150 pickup trucks were wildly popular in 2018, with 909,330 vehicles sold, but that ""twice as many modern rifles were sold the same year.""

Ouimet added in a comment to Fox News Digital, which comes two weeks after the Illinois legislation was signed into law, that the ""NRA has worked diligently to put together the strongest lawsuit possible.""

""While some rush to file litigation first out of the gate, we work to file the strongest legal challenge, one that will withstand the lengthy litigation process,"" he said. ""We filed Bruen ( New York State Rifle & Pistol Association Inc. v. Bruen ) in February 2018, and the Supreme Court did not issue its ruling on that case until June 2022. We know firsthand that filing the right suit is paramount to making sure that we have the best chance at the best outcome for our members and gun owners.""

GUN RIGHTS GROUP FILES LAWSUIT OVER ILLINOIS ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN

The NRA and other Second Amendment advocates have argued that the ban targets commonly owned and purchased firearms and magazines, thus violating the Constitution.

More than six dozen sheriffs have also come out against the law, vowing to defy the bans they have also characterized as unconstitutional.

DOZENS OF ILLINOIS SHERIFFS VOW TO DEFY GOVERNOR'S ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN

""Part of my duties that I accepted upon being sworn into office was to protect the rights provided to all of us, in the Constitution,"" Edwards County Sheriff Darby Boewe said in a recent Facebook post.

""One of those rights enumerated is the right of the people to KEEP and BEAR ARMS provided under the 2nd Amendment. The right to keep and bear arms for defense of life, liberty and property is regarded as an inalienable right by the people.""

The sheriff of DuPage County, Jim Mendrick, added in his own statement this month: ""Neither myself nor my office will be checking to ensure that lawful gun owners register their weapons with the State, nor will we be arresting or housing law-abiding individuals that have been arrested solely with non-compliance of this Act.""

He is now coming under fire from lawmakers who say he doesn't have the authority to override laws.

""He's going to put the police officers that are there to protect them directly in the line of fire,"" Democratic Illinois Rep. Sean Casten said Monday at a press conference, according to Fox 32. ""The sheriff's position is dangerous and unconstitutional.""

SECOND AMENDMENT GROUPS WARN OF ILLINOIS GUN CONTROL BILL HEADING TO GOVERNOR'S DESK

Mendrick fired back, saying that ""there is absolutely nothing that we are doing or not doing that would make a mass shooting more accessible in DuPage County.""

""In fact, I have asked on multiple occasions to increase penalties on all existing gun crimes, but it does not appear that they want to have that conversation. They seem more concerned with lawful gun owners than people illegally possessing guns,"" the sheriff added.

Pritzker’s office slammed the sheriffs for vowing to not enforce the law in a comment to Fox News Digital last week, calling their statements ""political grandstanding at its worst.""

""The assault weapons ban is the law of Illinois,"" Pritzker’s office told Fox News Digital on Monday. ""The General Assembly passed the bill and the governor signed it into law to protect children in schools, worshippers at church and families at parades from the fear of sudden mass murder.""

""Sheriffs have a constitutional duty to uphold the laws of the state, not pick and choose which laws they support and when. We’re confident that this law will hold up to any future legal challenges, but again, it is the current law of our state.

NRA slams Senate's bipartisan gun control package saying it 'falls short at every level',"The National Rifle Association slammed the Senate's bill text for its bipartisan gun control package, saying it ""falls short at every level."".

""The NRA will support legislation that improves school security, promotes mental health services, and helps reduce violent crime. However, we will oppose this gun control legislation because it falls short at every level. It does little to truly address violent crime while opening the door to unnecessary burdens on the exercise of Second Amendment freedom by law-abiding gun owners,"" the NRA said in a statement Tuesday.

The Senate released the 80-page text of the bill on Tuesday, which includes grants for states that implement their own red flag laws, would expand background checks for gun buyers under 21, creates penalties for straw purchases of firearms, requires more gun sellers to register as Federally Licensed Firearm Dealers.

The Senate voted to advance the bill at a 64 to 34 vote, with 14 Republicans supporting the effort. The procedural vote signals the bill would have enough support to pass the 60-vote threshold needed to break a filibuster in the Senate when it comes up for an official vote.

NRA ENCOURAGES 'REAL SOLUTIONS' TO 'STOP VIOLENCE' AFTER SENATORS REACH BIPARTISAN GUN FRAMEWORK AGREEMENT

The NRA continued in its statement that the legislation ""can be abused to restrict lawful gun purchases, infringe upon the rights of law-abiding Americans.""

This legislation would ""use federal dollars to fund gun control measures being adopted by state and local politicians. This bill leaves too much discretion in the hands of government officials and also contains undefined and overbroad provisions – inviting interference with our constitutional freedoms,"" the NRA statement said.

PRESIDENT BIDEN URGES CONGRESS TO PASS BIPARTISAN GUN FRAMEWORK

""Decisions by the Supreme Court of the United States in the Heller and McDonald cases make clear that the Second Amendment is an individual constitutional freedom. We will always fight for those freedoms – and the fundamental values we have defended for over 150 years,"" the NRA concluded in its statement Tuesday.

A group of senators, including Republican Sen. John Cornyn and Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy, announced this month that they had come to an agreement on a ""commonsense, bipartisan proposal to protect America’s children, keep our schools safe, and reduce the threat of violence across our country."" The agreement followed a series of devastating mass shootings, including one at a school in Uvalde, Texas, that left 19 children and two adults dead.

The NRA issued a response to the tentative agreement, vowing its commitment ""to real solutions to help stop violence in our communities,"" but did not take a stance on the framework as leaders at the organization had not yet read the bill.

NYC ghost gun builder arrested after sharing photo of 7-year-old son wielding firearms: prosecutors,"A New York City man has been arrested for manufacturing and possessing more than a dozen ghost guns after he shared an image of his 7-year-old son wielding two of the firearms, prosecutors say.

Cory Davis, 41, is now facing multiple charges after New York City police officers recovered 14 of the privately assembled weapons in two of his apartments, including ""10 semi-automatic pistols and two assault weapon-style pistols,"" according to the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office.

""The allegations make it evident that by manufacturing these weapons, Davis put not only the public, but a child in serious peril,"" District Attorney Alvin Bragg said in a statement. ""Using one’s child as a prop to showcase homemade, illegal weapons is inexcusable and extremely dangerous. The proliferation of ghost guns in our city cannot continue.""

Federal judge issues ruling over Oregon's strict gun law after police ask for more time,"UPDATE: This story has been updated to reflect Judge Karin J. Immergut's ruling Tuesday.

A federal judge on Tuesday ordered the permit-to-purchase portion of Oregon's strict new gun law be delayed 30 days after police said they wouldn't have time to implement the new system.

The ruling will allow Oregonians to purchase firearms without first obtaining a permit for 30 days after Dec. 8, when the rest of Measure 114 is still set to take effect. Those provisions include a ban on ammunition magazines capable of holding more than 10 rounds and background checks for all gun sales.

Judge Karin J. Immergut issued the stay ""in light of the difficulty the State has conceded in terms of implementation of the permitting provisions at this stage,"" she wrote in the 43-page ruling, the Oregonian reported.

The state's attorney general had asked Immergut on Sunday night for a two-month extension of the law's training requirement — part of the permitting process — after police said they would not be prepared to issue permits by Dec. 8, meaning all gun sales would cease.

ELECTION DAY VOTERS TALK CRIME, FIRST-TIME GUN BUYER SURGE

Police in Oregon had hoped Immergut would grant a delay to give them enough time to create and implement a permit-to-purchase system without any hiccups.

""An opportunity to kind of take a step back and really work on the mechanics of what we need to do to fulfill ballot Measure 114, that would be a huge gift to us in this holiday season,"" Eugene Police Chief Chris Skinner told Fox News.

""One of the nuances of this ballot measure that's really unclear to us is who's responsible to do that training,"" said Skinner, who serves as president of the Oregon Association Chiefs of Police, which represents police agencies across the state.

The Oregon State Sheriffs' Association ""is not aware of any training program that is currently available and meets all of Measure 114's strict requirements,"" the organization's executive director, Jason Myers, wrote in a statement to the court.

OREGON POLICE SAY THEY NEED MORE TIME TO PREPARE FOR GUN PERMIT LAW:

WATCH MORE FOX NEWS DIGITAL ORIGINALS HERE

That argument convinced the Oregon Department of Justice to ask the judge to allow Oregonians to complete firearms purchases without a valid permit for two months but keep the Dec. 8 start date for all other parts of the measure, including restrictions on large capacity magazines and the process of applying for a permit.

""Postponement of just the training requirement isn't going to be enough for us to meet the Dec. 8 deadline,"" Skinner said. ""We still need to figure out what a uniform application looks like.""

Immergut also heard arguments Friday relating to the first of several lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of the measure. She said in her Tuesday ruling that the plaintiffs failed to show that Measure 114 would cause ""immediate and irreparable harm.""

The measure mandates instruction on state and federal gun laws, safe storage, the effect of suicide and homicide on communities, how to report lost or stolen firearms, as well as an in-person demonstration of locking, unloading, firing and storing a gun.

OACP and OSSA both opposed Measure 114, with the latter organization arguing the law would cost local governments $49 million annually and divert public safety resources.

Myers wrote that local law enforcement agencies don't have the staff to process applications quickly. He expects it will take ""many months"" before the system can process permits quickly enough to meet demand.

OREGON SHERIFFS WON'T ENFORCE NEW GUN LAW: ‘INFRINGES ON SECOND AMENDMENT’

Voters approved Measure 114 last month by a slim margin after its proponents argued it would reduce violent crime , accidental deaths and suicides.

""We were caught off guard a little bit with respect to how quickly the implementation deadline was going to come up,"" Skinner said. ""I'm not sure there's an agency in a state that's going to be able to meet that deadline.""

Police originally expected the law to take effect no sooner than 30 days after the election was certified, Skinner said, which would have given them until January 2023.

But according to a spokesperson for the secretary of state's office, the Oregon Constitution states that measures take effect 30 days after they are approved by voters, which has traditionally been interpreted as 30 days after election day.

Prior to the ruling, if a delay was not granted, Skinner asked residents to be patient with police and know that they're working hard to get a permit system in place.

""Throughout my entire department, I'm short-staffed,"" he said. ""And I know that many chiefs from around the state are feeling that same pain when it comes to trying to hire and retain people to do the work that we have now.""

Raleigh officer used stun gun during struggle with man who died in custody,"Raleigh police repeatedly used stun guns during a struggle with a man who died in custody this month, according to a report released Monday.

Officer stun guns made contact three times with Darryl Tyree Williams early Jan. 17 before he died at a hospital after being handcuffed, according to the report by the police chief. Police had previously said they used a stun gun, but the report provides further details.

The report said officers approached Williams as he sat in the driver's seat of a parked car. Officers attempted to arrest him after they found a folded dollar bill with white powder in his pocket, the report said.

Rhode Island man tries to sneak 'artfully concealed' gun parts in peanut butter jars through TSA,"A Rhode Island man is facing a hefty fine after he was allegedly caught trying to conceal gun parts in two jars of peanut butter at JFK International Airport in New York City on Dec. 22.

His checked baggage set off a metal detector, prompting TSA officers to take a closer look at his luggage.

Firearm parts from a .22 caliber gun, including a loaded magazine, were found wrapped in plastic then stuffed inside two peanut butter jars, according to the TSA.

"States with higher rate of gun ownership do not correlate with more gun murders, data show","Calls have rung out across the nation demanding gun control laws in a bid to curb violent crimes such as the recent series of mass shootings. Data, however, show that in states with higher percentages of households with at least one gun, crimes are not higher than in states with strict gun laws.

""Gun ownership is higher in states with fewer restrictions, and homicide rates in these states are lower. People can protect themselves,"" George Mason University Professor Emerita Joyce Lee Malcolm told Fox News Digital of what she's found through her research. Malcolm pointed to a study on burglars from 1986 that found 34% of burglars interviewed reported ""to having been scared off, shot at, wounded or captured by an armed victim.""

Fox News Digital compiled FBI data from 2019 detailing murders and gun murders per 100,000 population for most states, as well as assembled Rand Corporation data released in 2020 showing the percentage of households with at least one firearm in 2016. The data does not reflect the skyrocketing violent crimes of 2020 and likely undercounts the current percentages of homes with at least one firearm as it does not reflect the influx of Americans who rushed to arm themselves in 2020.

The data show that many states with higher percentages of gun ownership had lower or similar murder and gun murder rates to states with strict gun control. Montana and Wyoming came in the top spots for states with the highest percentages of gun ownership, with more than 66% of households with at least one firearm. However, the states also saw murder and gun murder rates similar to states with strict gun laws.

EXPERTS SLAM NYT'S CLAIM LEGAL GUN SALES PARTLY TO BLAME FOR RAPID INCREASE IN VIOLENT CRIME

In 2019, Montana recorded 1.5 gun murders per 100,000 population and 2.5 murders per 100,000 population. In Massachusetts - which tied with New Jersey for lowest gun ownership in the country at 14.7% of households with at least one gun - the state saw similar murder rates to Montana, at 1.25 gun murders per 100,000 people and 2.12 murders per the same population.

In California, where just over 28% of households had at least one gun in 2016, there was a rate of more than four people murdered per 100,000 population and nearly three gun murders per 100,000 population in 2019. While in Maryland, where about 30% of households owned at least one firearm, according to 2016 data, murders per 100,000 population jumped to roughly nine, while more than seven people per 100,000 were victims of gun murders.

Fox News Digital examined gun ownership in the U.S. in 2010 and found it was at about the same levels as in 2016. Gun ownership spiked in 2020 during the pandemic amid the summer's riots and protests, partially driven by first-time gun owners from different racial and political backgrounds. Gun sales have also spiked in states with strict gun laws, such as California, with firearm store owners in the Los Angeles area last year attributing the sales to the increase in violent crimes.

BLACK LA RESIDENTS LACK ACCESS TO GUNS AS WEALTHY RUSH TO BUY FIREARMS AMID CRIME WAVE: ACTIVISTS

John Lott, president of the Crime Prevention Research Center, examined the data compiled by Fox News Digital and said that though ""graphs making comparisons across places are very common,"" ""they are too simplistic as they don't account for many other reasons that crime rates can vary (such as law enforcement, drug gang problems, demographic, and cultural differences).""

He advised looking at a singular place over time to see how crime rates change ""as gun ownership rates change and to compare them in many different places."" He noted that there are places around the world that ""have banned either all guns or all handguns, yet every single time that those bans have been enacted, murder/homicide rates have gone up.""

MORE THAN 23M FIREARMS SOLD, OVER 21M GUN BACKGROUND CHECKS CONDUCTED IN 2020

""The explanation is simple: while you might take some guns away from criminals, if you primarily have law-abiding people obeying the ban, you mainly disarm law-abiding people and make it easier for criminals to commit crime,"" he said.

A series of recent mass shootings rocked the U.S. and rekindled calls from elected officials and activists to enact gun control measures.

""I respect the culture and the tradition and the concerns of lawful gun owners. At the same time, the Second Amendment, like all other rights, is not absolute,"" President Biden said following the Uvalde school shooting that left 19 children and two teachers dead in Texas last month.

""This isn't about taking away anyone's rights. It's about protecting children. It's about protecting families. It's about protecting whole communities. It's about protecting our freedoms to go to school, to a grocery store, to a church without being shot and killed,"" he added.

Biden has called for banning ""assault weapons and high capacity magazines,"" raising the age to purchase a gun to 21, strengthening background checks, implementing red flag laws, and taking other measures to curb violent crimes.

A group of bipartisan senators answered Biden's calls for action and successfully negotiated a bill that will incentivize states to pass red flag laws and expand background checks for 18- to 21-year-olds, among other initiatives. Biden signed the bill into law on Friday.

FBI DATA SHOWS LARGE INCREASE IN MURDERS IN 2020 NATIONWIDE

Gun control activists lauded the bipartisan effort but added that more must be done.

""And while this agreement is not perfect, many details remain to be worked out and more must be done. If carefully drafted and passed into law, this framework would be a lifesaving step forward,"" former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords, a vocal gun control advocate nearly killed in 2011 by a gunman, said this month.

Crime has spiked across the U.S. since 2020, with experts pinning the blame on the summer of protests and riots following high-profile deaths of Americans during interactions with police, the Ferguson effect and defund the police movement, and fallout from the coronavirus and its lockdowns.

Others, such as the New York Times, have posited that 2020's skyrocketing increase in gun purchases has also possibly contributed to the crime spikes.

Gun sales had a banner year in 2020, with an estimated 23 million firearms sold and more than 21 million gun background checks conducted. The numbers smashed records and notably spiked at the onset of the pandemic in March before jumping again in June of that year as protests and riots spread across the nation in response to the death of George Floyd.

SCALISE BLASTS DEMS FOR RUSHING TO CALL FOR GUN CONTROL AFTER SHOOTINGS, BLAMES LIBERAL DAS FOR RISING CRIME

Experts who previously spoke to Fox News Digital squashed claims that the increase in legal gun sales has contributed to crime in 2022.

""The short answer is that there is absolutely no statistical evidence to that effect showing some causal relationship"" between the increase in gun purchases and increase in violent crimes, the Heritage Foundation's Amy Swearer told Fox News Digital in April.

Cully Stimson, also of the Heritage Foundation, added that ""for the last 27, 29 years, our country has had a dramatic decrease in violent crime. Violent crime peaked in 1992-93, and it has been on the wane ever since then — until recently.""

""That and that alone rebuts the argument that increased legal gun ownership has contributed to this spike in crime. What, they didn't do it for 30 years? Even though they bought tens of millions of guns between 92 and now.""

The data compiled by Fox News Digital this month shows that Delaware, where roughly 34% of households have at least one gun, had a gun murder rate of about four people per 100,000 residents. That rate is higher than the top five states with the highest percentage of households with firearms, except for Alaska.

A handful of states showed fewer than one murder per 100,000 people, including Hawaii, South Dakota, Idaho, Rhode Island, and Maine. More than half of South Dakota and Idaho households have at least one firearm, while more than 46% of households in Maine have at least one gun. However, less than 15% of Hawaii and Rhode Island households have at least one firearm.

Alaska was one of the few states with high rates of gun ownership and gun murder, checking in at six gun murders per 100,000 population, with over 64% of households owning guns. But Alaska's status as an outlier may have more to do with other factors, such as the state's longer periods of darkness and the corresponding crime and rates of depression accompanying it. Alaska was also among states that saw violent crimes and homicides decrease in 2020 and notched an 18.5% decrease in crime overall that year.

""States and cities such as Washington, D.C., Chicago, and Baltimore with the most restrictive gun control laws and fewer gun owners have much higher rates of homicides than states with more liberal gun laws.

Supreme Court rejects New York gun retailers' bid to block new concealed carry laws,"The Supreme Court rejected a bid by New York gun retailers on Wednesday to block a slew of new gun control laws in the state, which they argued violate their Second Amendment rights and hurt their businesses.

There were no noted dissents in the order or explanations from the justices for their decision.

""We are disappointed that not one of the nine justices saw fit to grant the plaintiffs some stay of enforcement of the new laws against them,"" Paloma Capanna, the lead attorney for the New York gun retailers, told Fox News Digital on Wednesday.

""We are challenging the ability of the state of New York to target dealers in firearms in the lawful stream of commerce, to put them out of business, which is what the new laws will do,"" Capanna added. ""So it really was unfortunate to see that we couldn't get any emergency temporary injunction against those laws.""

New York Attorney General Letitia James praised the Supreme Court's decision on Wednesday, saying that the ""gun safety laws help save lives, and keep our state safer.""

SEMIAUTOMATIC WEAPONS BAN BECOMES ILLINOIS LAW

Wednesday's order comes one week after the high court rejected a separate bid by gun rights activists to block the Concealed Carry Improvement Act, which was implemented last year by New York's Democrat-controlled legislature.

New York lawmakers passed that bill after the Supreme Court struck down the state's prior concealed carry law in June 2022 in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in that opinion for the court that ""the Second and Fourteenth Amendments protect an individual’s right to carry a handgun for self-defense outside the home.""

The new law prohibits carrying a gun in ""sensitive areas,"" such as stadiums, houses of worship, museums, parks and other public places; imposes revised record-keeping and new safety requirements on retailers; and mandates background checks on all ammunition purchases.

Capanna, the attorney for the gun retailers, argued that new record-keeping laws could amount to an unconstitutional gun registry.

""The list of new mandatory compliance even goes so far as a turnover of acquisition and disposition records… which the state of New York attorneys have admitted will be used to create the first-ever gun owners registry housed at the New York State Police,"" Capanna said Wednesday.

Multiple challenges to the new law are continuing to play out in lower courts.

"Top Gun Maverick: Navy, Air Force look for recruitment boost following big opening for Tom Cruise sequel","The military will look for the success of ""Top Gun: Maverick"" to boost recruitment, repeating the effect of the original film.

""We did get a good recruiting bump from ‘Top Gun’ in 1986 when I went to the theaters and saw ‘Top Gun’ with my friends in '86,"" Maj. Gen. Edward W.

""We expect ‘Top Gun: Maverick’ to do the same,"" he added. ""You know, whether people want to aim high or fly Navy, we just want them to get excited about serving the nation in some capacity.""

The original 1986 ""Top Gun"" movie was a box office hit that cemented Tom Cruise as a movie star: It also created a 500% increase in applications from young men who wanted to be Naval Aviators.

Military officials believe they can see a similar – though not exact – boost from the sequel film, ""Top Gun: Maverick."" The new film, which was released over Memorial Day weekend, and gave Cruise his first $100 million opening weekend for a film, raking in an impressive $321 million global total.

The military looked to capitalize on the high buzz and impressive reviews – sitting at 97% on Rotten Tomatoes with over 360 reviews – by running a recruitment ad before the movie. Thomas said that the service had ""a lot of fun"" making the ad, which he called a ""high-speed, adrenaline-pumping aviation air power commercial.""

""This commercial has it all,"" Thomas said. ""And the idea is that people are going to go to the movie … We want them to get excited about military service again, whether that’s naval aviation or come and apply for the Air Force.""

""We want to take advantage of the opportunity to connect not just the movie and the idea of a military service, but the fact that we’ve got jobs and we’ve got recruiters waiting for them.""

The movie boasts impressive visuals as Cruise pushed for the movie to remain as practical and realistic as possible (as he reminds viewers in a short speech prior to the movie’s start.) Cruise famously fought back interest from streaming services to pick up the movie during the pandemic because he insisted the movie needed to be seen in theaters on the biggest screens possible.

Part of the appeal is due to the fact that the Navy allowed the film to use planes, aircraft carriers and military bases for the production. The crew flew in real planes that cost the production more than $11,000 an hour to rent, but only military-trained pilots could handle the jets.

Paramount Pictures said in the movie's production notes that Cruise established his own flight training program to prepare the film's young actors for the nausea-inducing rigors of plane maneuvers, and so they could perform their roles with ""real Navy pilots taking them on the ride of their lives.""

"Who is Kimberly Gardner, St. Louis prosecutor investigating gun-toting couple?","The St. Louis husband and wife who pointed guns at a crowd marching through a private neighborhood in June are facing charges, Circuit Attorney Kimberly Gardner announced Monday.

Gardner, who was elected in 2016 on a platform of reforming the criminal justice system, reportedly was backed by liberal billionaire George Soros.

ST. LOUIS COUPLE WHO BRANDISHED GUNS BEING INVESTIGATED AFTER CLASH WITH PROTESTERS

Since being elected, Gardner has butted heads publicly with Missouri’s Republican attorney general and faced lawsuits for allegedly ignoring public records requests.

More about Gardner's investigation into the St. Louis couple, Soros' campaign support, her feud with the state attorney general and the lawsuits against her office:

Investigation into gun-toting couple

In a statement last month, Gardner described the encounter between married lawyers Mark and Patricia McCloskey and the crowd as “a violent assault” against those exercising their First Amendment rights.

“I am alarmed at the events that occurred over the weekend, where peaceful protesters were met by guns and a violent assault,” Gardner said. “We must protect the right to peacefully protest, and any attempt to chill it through intimidation or threat of deadly force will not be tolerated.”

""It is illegal to wave weapons in a threatening manner -- that is unlawful in the city of St. Louis,"" she added on July 20, announcing the charges of felony unlawful use of a weapon.

ARMED ST. LOUIS PROTESTERS BROKE IRON GATE, THREATENED COUPLE BEFORE THEY DREW THEIR OWN GUNS, ATTORNEY SAYS

Albert Watkins, the McCloskeys' attorney, told Fox News that under Missouri's Castle Doctrine, a person has “the absolute unmitigated right to protect his or her castle or family while on their property.” He said the protesters were trespassing, ""damaging and destroying private property and acting in a threatening and hostile fashion.""

“If Kimberly Gardner wants to press charges against two attorneys who are protecting their home and their family and themselves on their own property, I will tell you that it will be nothing short of the proverbial clusterf--- with the ensuing assertions that she's doing this for political purposes,” Watkins said.

""And I will tell you that as a person, I don't believe that to be what she is doing,” Watkins added. “I just believe she probably has a difficult time reading the English language.”

George Soros connection

Gardner, a Democrat, was elected circuit attorney of St. Louis in 2016, running on a campaign that promised to reform and rebuild trust in the criminal justice system and reduce violent crime.

WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT PORTLAND PLACE, WHERE ST. LOUIS COUPLE POINTED GUNS AT PROTESTERS

She was criticized ahead of the election for releasing a political ad paid for by the Safety and Justice Super PAC that was at least partially funded by liberal billionaire George Soros, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported.

The total funds donated by the super PAC were at least $190,750, according to the report, with Soros giving at least $30,000. It was not immediately clear what her campaign budget was or who else contributed.

Gardner at the time told the paper that she had no regrets about accepting help from the super PAC.

Soros is known for backing left-wing causes across the globe, having last year used his super PAC to successfully boost two liberal prosecutor candidates in Virginia over incumbent Democrats.

Beef with Missouri AG

Gardner publicly butted heads with Missouri’s Republican Attorney General Eric Schmitt, who she referred to as a “Trump wannabe” during an online meeting of local political candidates earlier this month, FOX2 St. Louis reported.

Schmitt had earlier criticized Gardner on Twitter for allowing the release of all 36 rioters and looters arrested in the city following protests over the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor.

“In a stunning development, our office has learned that every single one of the St. Louis looters and rioters arrested were released back onto the streets by local prosecutor Kim Gardner,” Schmitt tweeted June 3.

Gardner responded that only eight of the 36 cases were referred to her office and that police did not provide “admissible evidence.""

“He just wants to launch a politically motivated attack against me, even if it means misleading and lying to the public,” Gardner said of Schmitt. “While the AG continues to fuel the division in the community at a time of great pain, suffering and racial divide, my response to the AG: I got work to do.""

Lawsuits against Gardner's office

Gardner was sued last week for at least the third time over the state’s Sunshine Law, an open records law that requires the government to respond within three days to requests for public records, the Post-Dispatch reported.

The latest lawsuit claims Gardner’s office failed to fulfill an April 23 open records request for data on case statistics, dismissal data and staffing totals, the paper said. Her office responded in a letter May 12, according to the paper, saying more time was needed to fulfill the request due to the coronavirus.

The Post-Dispatch also sued Gardner’s office in 2019 over her office’s refusal to release copies of contracts with vendors. A judge ruled in the paper’s favor in April, but the paper said Gardner’s office has not yet fully complied.

Gardner sues city officials

Gardner also filed her own lawsuit against city officials in January under a federal law passed to curb the violence of the Ku Klux Klan following the Civil War.

In the suit, Gardner accused city officials, the local police union and a special prosecutor of a “racially motivated conspiracy to deny the civil rights of racial minorities” by obstructing her work to get tough on police misconduct and create change in the criminal justice system, The New York Times reported at the time.

ST. LOUIS COUPLE DRAW WEAPONS ON PROTESTERS HEADED TO MAYOR'S HOUSE: REPORT

Her opponents denied the accusations, with a police union leader calling the suit “frivolous, desperate and pathetic,” the paper reported.

Gardner has been at odds with the St. Louis police and local legal establishment since taking office and taking steps to hold police officers more accountable, according to the paper.

Conviction rate falls

The rate of convictions under Gardner has fallen dramatically in the past two years, according to a KMOV-TV report from February.

The station obtained data from Gardner’s office that showed prosecutors got guilty verdicts in 51 percent of cases in 2018, and in 54 percent of cases in 2019. The station reported convictions had dropped by about 20 percent.

A spokesperson for Gardner’s office responded to the station at the time, saying that counting plea agreements, the overall conviction rate is 95 percent. They said over 90 percent of cases are resolved outside the courtroom.

“The Circuit Attorney ran on a platform to reduce the number of cases unnecessarily charged in order to focus on the more difficult cases for trial,” the statement said.

Gun buyback participant turns in firearm to get cash for 'better weapon',"A woman in Baltimore is using the city’s gun buyback program, not to get firearms off the street but to upgrade to a better weapon.

On Monday, the city's Police Department paid gun owners anywhere from $25 to $500 for their unwanted firearms and magazines in an attempt to get weapons off the street, FOX 45 News reported.

By 5:30 p.m., more than 500 firearms had been collected.

The city paid out $25 for rifle magazines that carry more than 10 rounds, $100 for revolvers, and pump and bolt-action weapons. $200 for semi-automatic weapons and $500 for fully automatic weapons.

While some residents turned in firearms that went unused for years, a woman who went by the name Darlene told the station she was turning in her 9 mm so she could “upgrade to a better weapon.""

“I don’t know [what type of weapon],” she said. “I haven’t quite decided.”

FIREARMS ENTHUSIASTS CRASH GUN BUYBACK TO HUNT BARGAINS

Others said they were turning in their weapons for quick cash or to support the city’s efforts to thwart gun violence.

Many cities have embraced gun buyback campaigns in recent years, but experts have said they are ineffective at reducing gun violence, USA Today reported.

A big flaw is that the firearms collected usually are not the kind typically used in crimes.

""They make for good photo images,"" said Michael Scott, director of the Center for Problem Oriented Policing, based at the University of Wisconsin's law school. ""But gun buyback programs recover such a small percentage of guns that it's not likely to make much impact.""

""They make for good photo images. But gun buyback programs recover such a small percentage of guns that it's not likely to make much impact."" — Michael Scott, director, Center for Problem Oriented Policing

Another problem is the programs tend to attract people who are less likely to commit crimes.

MINNESOTA GUN BUYBACK PROGRAM A DUD, SOME LEGAL OWNERS SAY

Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh said she isn’t deterred by the studies.

“There are all kinds of studies that say all kinds of different things,” the mayor told Fox last week. “Our point here is, there are guns on the streets of our city. We are signaling folks out there, we don’t care if its Grandpa’s gun or your gun, we want it.”

""We are signaling folks out there, we don’t care if its Grandpa’s gun or your gun, we want it."" — Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh

The city hosted another buyback campaign Wednesday and will have another Friday.

In Hartford, Conn., city officials have held a gun buyback programs for the past decade. A buyback campaign last week netted 137 firearms, FOX 61 reported.

Some of the firearms are destroyed while others serve a more useful purpose. A manhole cover used in the 1990s was made from 172 pounds of confiscated guns. Another Nazi-era firearm was auctioned.

""Not one more victim of senseless violence or gun in the wrong hands that will commit an act of violence,"" said Hartford Police Lt. Paul Cicero, a detective in the Hartford police Major Crimes Division. ""Just recently we had a four-year-old that shot themselves in the hand with an unsecured firearm in a house that was also an unwanted gun. So, we want to take those guns off the street.""",https://www.foxnews.com/us/woman-turns-in-gun-at-baltimore-gun-buyback-progam-to-upgrade-to-better-weapon,N/A
"At Mexico's lone gun store, even the boss discourages sales","next Image 1 of 3

prev next Image 2 of 3

There's just one place in all of Mexico where you can legally buy a gun. It's tucked away in an anonymous building on an army base in the capital, staffed by soldiers.

Those who enter must surrender any cellphones, tablets or cameras, remove caps and pass through a metal detector. Weapons are kept in locked glass cases, unlike many of the 50,000-plus U.S. gun shops where used-gun racks on showroom floors allow easy access and clerks are happy to let you heft an unloaded firearm.

Mexico's constitution guarantees citizens' right to own a handgun and hunting rifles for self-defense and sport. Legally getting your hands on one, however, requires clearing a series of bureaucratic hurdles far stricter than in the United States and, for many, travelling great distances to reach the country's lone gun store.

In fact, most of Mexico's 120 million inhabitants probably don't even know about the Directorate of Arms and Munitions Sales — it is prohibited from advertising any of its goods, or the mere fact that it exists.

But that hasn't stopped sales from booming, in parallel with a large and active black-market trade for contraband weapons flooding south from the United States.

According to army records, the store sold 549 guns in 2000. For 2015, sales had risen to 10,115, an increase reflecting the rise in concern about personal safety during a surge in violent deaths in Mexico.

Sales spiked most dramatically after 2006, when then-President Felipe Calderon took office and declared war on Mexico's drug cartels. The country recorded more than 164,000 killings between 2007 and 2014, according to official statistics.

At the gun store, 27 brands are on offer, from the United States' Colt, Austria's Glock and Italy's Beretta to the locally made Mendoza and Trejo.

Although gun ownership is enshrined in the constitution, the provision also empowers the government to regulate the types of weapons that are permitted and under what conditions. Mexicans can legally purchase one handgun for home protection, while members of hunting or shooting clubs can acquire up to nine rifles of no more than .30 caliber and shotguns up to 12 gauge, said the store's manager, Col. Eduardo Tellez Moreno.

But unlike those who run U.S. gun shops, Tellez would rather no one buy what he's selling.

""It's preferred not to have a gun, even at home, because there could be accidents or worse, accidents within families due to the mishandling of weapons. It's like having a match close to a fire,"" Tellez said. ""It's an obligation of the state to provide security to the people who live in the country, not for you to take justice into your own hands.""

Some people aren't confident about authorities' ability to provide security.

On a recent day, Mexico City resident Alejandro Lozano came to pick up a hunting rifle after waiting about a week while his documents were processed. He said he keeps a handgun at home, but wishes he could legally carry it to protect himself from violent robberies targeting bus passengers, motorists at stoplights and customers emerging from banks and ATMs.

""It's not difficult"" to get a gun, Lozano said. But ""we would like it better that they would let us carry like in the United States . that they let us carry whatever caliber we choose.""

At least six separate documents are required to buy a gun: a birth certificate, a letter confirming employment, proof of a clean criminal record from the attorney general's office in the applicant's home state, a utility bill with current address, a copy of a government-issued ID and a federal social security number.

Gun owners must register every weapon they have, and people say it's nearly impossible to secure a concealed carry permit, something that's allowed in the majority of U.S. states.

Luciano Segurajauregui Alvarez, a gun advocate who shoots recreationally and competitively, said those permits are routinely denied.

""If I put my papers in ... they're going to take about three to four, even six months, and then send me a letter telling me that it's the obligation of the state to provide security for all people in Mexico, so your permit is denied,"" said Segurajauregui, who is a professor of design at Mexico's Metropolitan Autonomous University.

He called that idiotic. ""You can't assign a soldier to preserve the security of each and every one of the people,"" he said.

Gun advocates say relaxing gun restrictions would help private citizens protect themselves from heavily armed gangs that terrorize and extort people in various parts of the country.

Many Mexicans perceive government security forces as unable to do that job, and often actually being in cahoots with the cartels. Since 2013, civilian ""self-defense"" militias have sprung up in some rural areas as communities became fed up by corruption, organized crime and a failure by police and military forces to keep them safe from drug gangs.

""To see us alone, to see us unprotected by the government, what did we have to do as citizens? Take up arms to defend our families and our own lives,"" said Hipolito Mora, a co-founder of a militia in Michoacan, one of the country's most restive states.

Yet, while Mexico has a homicide rate more than five times higher than in the U.S., such sentiments have brought no widespread debate about gun rights and there is no political push to ease firearm restrictions.

""I think it's a non-issue,"" said Alejandro Hope, a security analyst in Mexico City. ""The extreme liberal regime around gun control that exists in the United States is seen as a bizarre phenomenon. That carrying guns is seen as a major human right is bizarre.""

Mexico's lone gun store sold 52,147 firearms in 2009-14, a figure dwarfed by the black market trade that's largely fueled by illegal American imports. Mexican law bars guns from entering without an ""extraordinary import authorization,"" but enforcement is spotty — 73,684 of the 104,850 guns confiscated in Mexico during the same period were traced to the United States, according to the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

There are no current statistics on the number of weapons held by Mexicans. The Geneva-based Small Arms Survey says Mexicans owned 15.5 million firearms in 2007, of which 4.5 million were properly registered with the army.

On the black market, buyers get access to the same kind of high-caliber weapons used by cartels and can avoid paperwork, waiting periods and travel.

For residents in the northwestern city of Tijuana, for example, it's much simpler to buy a gun that has been purchased in one of San Diego's 15 or so gun shops and smuggled into Mexico instead of going 1,700 miles to Mexico City.

Segurajauregui said gun advocates want the military to open stores in each of Mexico's 31 states in addition to the capital, but there is no sign that's in the works.

""Gun reform in Mexico has always been a hot potato,"" he said. ""Nobody wants to touch it. Nobody.""",https://www.foxnews.com/world/at-mexicos-lone-gun-store-even-the-boss-discourages-sales,N/A
