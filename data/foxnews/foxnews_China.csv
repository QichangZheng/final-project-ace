0,"China blames US gun policies for global violence, says America exports ‘woes and instability’","America’s ""loose management"" of firearms is creating a ""recurring nightmare"" of domestic gun violence that is now spilling into other countries as U.S.-made weapons and ammunition are increasingly finding their way into the wrong hands, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Thursday.

Wang Wenbin, a spokesman for the ministry, lamented that at a United Nations meeting last week, the U.S. opposed a Chinese proposal to block transfers of ammunition to non-state actors. He then argued that America’s tolerance for guns is creating violence around the globe.

""Gun violence has become a recurring nightmare for the American people,"" Wang said. The U.S.’s loose management of small arms and light weapons and ammunition, massive weapons export and persistent transfer of military articles to non-state actors are equally worrying.""

""A lot of the ammunition from the U.S. have become untraceable and even ended up in the hands of terrorist and extremist groups, posing a grave threat to regional and international peace and stability,"" he added.

Wang said gun violence is increasingly America’s main export to the world.

""The U.S. brings to other countries not democracy or progress of human rights but livelihood woes and instability,"" he said. ""The U.S. needs to know that the more it engages in such exports, the worse the backfire will be on the U.S. itself.""

Wang added that violent elements in Mexico, Pakistan and elsewhere have been ""found to use U.S. weapons"" and noted a Center for American Progress study said more than 50,000 guns originating in the U.S. were recovered in 15 criminal investigations between 2014 and 2016.

His remarks came several days after a meeting of the United Nations Security Council, at which China said it is worried that U.S. exports of arms to Ukraine are raising the risk of ""strategic miscalculation and escalation of hostilities"" because they might be misdirected to ""terrorists and armed groups.""

The U.S. rejected that assessment at the meeting and dismissed the ""victim-blaming notion that Ukraine’s self-defense is the obstacle to ending this war.""

But Wang on Thursday repeated that there's a likelihood U.S. weapons sent to Ukraine will be ""smuggled by international criminal groups into the hands of criminals in Europe and elsewhere.""

1,US sending up to 200 more troops to Taiwan as China tensions grow,"The U.S. is preparing to send 100 to 200 troops to Taiwan for training amid rising tensions with China, a U.S. official familiar with the planning confirmed to Fox News on Thursday.

This number will expand a much smaller training program, which has included the National Guard, Special Ops, and U.S. Marines in the past.

The Michigan National Guard will also train a contingent of the Taiwanese Army, including some training as part of larger exercises, on U.S. soil.

The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the news, cited U.S. officials as saying only around 30 American troops were stationed in Taiwan about a year ago.

""We don't have a comment on specific operations, engagements, or training, but I would highlight that our support for, and defense relationship with, Taiwan remains aligned against the current threat posed by the People’s Republic of China,"" Lt. Col. Marty Meiners, a Defense Department spokesperson, told Fox News on Thursday.

""Our commitment to Taiwan is rock-solid and contributes to the maintenance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and within the region,"" he added.

PENTAGON SAYS MAJORITY OF DOWNED CHINESE SPY CRAFT FOUND

The Wall Street Journal described the planned troop increase in the coming months as the largest deployment of American forces in Taiwan in decades.

Officials who spoke to the newspaper said the increase has been planned for months, before China escalated tensions with the U.S. by flying a spy balloon over American soil.

The troops going to Taiwan will be tasked with training its military on U.S. weapon systems, as well as maneuvers to counter a potential offensive from China, they added.

In recent weeks, China has frequently been sending its ships and aircraft into Taiwanese waters and airspace.

Taiwan split from China in 1949 after a civil war. The only connection between the two nations is billions of dollars in trade and investment. Mainland China does not recognize Taiwan independence and wants it to unite with the mainland.

""One of the difficult things to determine is what really is objectionable to China,"" one of the U.S. officials told The Wall Street Journal about the planned troop deployment. ""We don’t think at the levels that we’re engaged in and are likely to remain engaged in the near future that we are anywhere close to a tipping point for China, but that’s a question that is constantly being evaluated and looked at specifically with every decision involving support to Taiwan.""

2,Does China’s purported green energy push signal a coming conflict with the US?,"Beijing is only attempting to appear as though it's concerned about climate change to appease the West — all while China is using more domestic coal as a way to strengthen energy independence in case of a future conflict, according to a policy analyst.

""The Biden administration and frankly, too many policymakers in Washington, D.C., continue to see China as a partner,"" Chuck DeVore, the chief national initiatives officer at the Texas Public Policy Foundation, told Fox News. ""They look at things like cooperation with climate change as one of the things that we should be working with China on.""

""I find [it] utterly remarkable that Chairman Xi [Jinping] of China and the Chinese Communist Party gives a tinker's damn about the planet's climate or climate change,"" DeVore continued. ""It is merely a device to engage gullible Westerners into thinking that somehow we can get meaningful cooperation.""

Jinping promised not building more coal-powered power plants abroad in 2021. But that same year, the country began building over half of the world’s new coal-based power plants, all within China, according to The Wilson Center.

Since the country doesn't have any other significant energy sources, China's reliance on coal allows Beijing to avoid depending on foreign sources, DeVore told Fox News. That also means China's recent increased investment in coal-powered industries helps protect its energy independence in case of conflict.

""It's not at all about green energy,"" Devore said. ""It's about making the Chinese economy resilient in the event of a conflict with America.""

China hit a coal production record in November — the same month President Biden and Xi discussed climate goals — and 2023 production is expected to expand further, according to China's National Bureau of Statistics. About 55% of China's energy comes from coal compared to 11% in the U.S., according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

""If you look at the amount of electric vehicles being sold in China, you look at their high-speed electric rail, et cetera, they're going all in,"" DeVore told Fox News. ""Those electric vehicles in China are coal-fired cars. That's where the energy comes from to charge the cars in China. Coal, Chinese coal.""

""If you thought that carbon dioxide emissions were a problem and the planet was warming, then you'd have to ask yourself, ‘why is it that the Chinese are converting so much of their coal into fuel right now,'"" DeVore added.

China has been increasing investment in its coal-to-liquids industry, which enables coal to be turned into cheap fuel for pedestrian and military use, according to DeVore. But that process makes more carbon dioxide emissions than traditional oil refining methods.

WHAT IS THE NATIONAL POWER GRID AND HOW RESILIENT IS IT?

Other Chinese green energy products have also sparked concerns from federal agencies.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection seized shipments of Chinese-made solar equipment last year because the products were from Xinjiang, where the U.S. has banned purchases over concerns of slave labor.

Regardless, climate change should not be the priority of U.S.-Chinese foreign policy, according to DeVore.

""America's number one priority is maintaining our ability to deter the People's Republic of China from aggression on its neighbors,"" he said. ""This would include the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, India, the nations of the Indo-Pacific.""

""These are nations that are now seriously threatened by a country that has increasingly grown aggressive and belligerent and has made no secret of its designs on its neighbors,"" DeVore told Fox News.

""It is no secret that the People’s Republic of China seeks to upend our dominance on the oceans across the globe,"" said Del Toro.

Del Toro noted that China currently possesses approximately 340 ships and is seeking to add 100 more by 2030.

This possible shift in naval dominance, Del Toro warned, could begin to reshape the world order.

4,China edges closer to sending lethal aid to Russia as UN votes to condemn invasion of Ukraine: report,"Russia is in talks with China to purchase 100 combat drones, according to a new report published just days after Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the U.S. had evidence Beijing was weighing lethal aid to Moscow in its war against Ukraine.

Der Spiegel reports that Moscow is looking to commission a Chinese manufacturer to mass produce the drones – with a delivery date as early as April.

Per the report, Xian Bingo Intelligent Aviation Technology, a Chinese drone manufacturer, has said it was prepared to make 100 prototypes of its ZT-180 drone, which carry a 35-50 kg warhead.

The drones are similar to Iran’s Shaheed-136, which Russia has used to kill hundreds of Ukrainians and damage infrastructure.

The report, citing sources familiar with the matter, says Bingo had plans to establish a productive site for the drones in Russia.

FOX NEWS POLL: HALF SAY US SHOULD SUPPORT UKRAINE AS LONG AS IT TAKES

Fox News Digital has contacted the State Department for comment on the report but did not hear back before publication.

Former intelligence officer Rebekah Koffler argued that China's decision calculus is ""entirely rational"" as helping Russia militarily keeps the U.S. bogged down in Ukraine and focusing on the European theater as Beijing eyes Taiwan.

""The biggest challenge for the United States would be to have to be engaged in two wars simultaneously, albeit by proxy – one with Russia, on behalf of Ukraine, and the other with China, on behalf of Taiwan,"" Koffler said. ""There are concerns within the Pentagon about how long U.S. stockpile would last if Russia and China were to challenge us in a two-theater war.""

The Der Spiegel report comes days after Blinken, who met with China’s top diplomat Wang Yi in Munich over the weekend, said the U.S. has evidence that China is considering providing lethal support to Russia.

U.S. State Department spokesperson Ned Price warned Wednesday there would be ""consequences"" if China were to provide lethal aid to Russia in its war against Ukraine.

Also on Thursday, the U.N. General Assembly approved a nonbinding resolution that calls for Russia to end hostilities in Ukraine and withdraw its forces. The resolution, drafted by Ukraine in consultation with its allies, passed 141-7, with 32 abstentions.

7,China furious after US warns against arming Russia: ‘The US is in no position to tell China what to do’,"Diplomatic relations between the U.S. and China deteriorated further on Monday after China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs snapped at the Biden administration for suggesting that it has information suggesting that China is considering sending weapons and ammunition to Russia to help its war against Ukraine.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken made that accusation Sunday on CBS, where he said Chinese companies have already been supplying Russia with non-lethal aid and may soon do more.

""The concern that we have now is, based on information we have, that they’re considering providing lethal support, and we’ve made very clear to them that that would cause a serious problem for us and in our relationship,"" Blinken said. When asked what lethal aid China might deliver, Blinken said, ""weapons.""

That remark drew a furious comment from China on Monday – but not an outright denial – even as China’s top diplomat was expected to travel to Moscow this week.

""It is the U.S. not China, that has been pouring weapons into the battlefield,"" Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Wang Wenbin said. ""The U.S. is in no position to tell China what to do. We would never stand for finger-pointing, or even coercion and pressurizing from the U.S. on our relations with Russia.""

Wang said China supports peace and took another shot at the U.S. by saying it’s the U.S. that is promoting conflict by arming Ukraine.

""The international community is fully aware who is calling for dialogue and striving for peace, and who is fanning the flames and stoking confrontation,"" he said. ""We urge the US side to seriously reflect on the role it has played, do something to actually help deescalate the situation and promote peace talks, and stop deflecting the blame and spreading disinformation.""

Wang said China would soon release a document proposing a peaceful resolution of the conflict, which will stress that a ""nuclear war must never be fought and can never be won.""

Wang also fired back at the U.S. over the diplomatic disruption that was caused when the Biden administration confirmed the existence of a Chinese surveillance balloon hovering over the U.S. That discovery prompted Blinken to postpone a scheduled trip to China.

8,US State Department hints at 'consequences' if China provides lethal aid to Russia for Ukraine war,"U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price on Wednesday warned there would be ""consequences"" if China were to provide lethal aid to Russia in its war against Ukraine, but when pressed on just what those consequences might be, he was more ambiguous.

Wednesday’s comments came after Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who met with China’s top diplomat Wang Yi in Munich over the weekend, said the U.S. has evidence China is considering providing lethal support to Russia.

Price clarified that the U.S. has not seen concrete evidence of direct support, but added ""we don’t believe they’ve taken it off the table, either.""

Price said China’s providing of lethal weapons to Russia for use in Ukraine ""would cause real consequences in our bilateral relationship.""

PUTIN SAYS CHINA HAS ‘AGREED’ ON PRESIDENT XI JINPING VISITING MOSCOW

""The [People’s Republic of China] understands what’s at risk were it to proceed with providing material support to Russia’s war against Ukraine,"" he said. ""We’ve been clear we will not hesitate to target Chinese companies or individuals that violate our sanctions, and we’re monitoring very vigilantly for potential violations.""

Price predicted that China would suffer ""reputational costs"" if it were to follow through with providing Russia with lethal aid.

""Already, it is providing diplomatic support. It is providing economic support. It is … spewing propaganda that serves to amplify the lies, the distortions, the myths, the half-truths that are emanating from Moscow,"" he said.

Later in the press conference, a reporter questioned what possible leverage the U.S. has as a deterrent if China sides with Russia.

Price said there was ""an advantage to some degree of ambiguity.""

""We have been clear with the PRC about the fact that consequences would befall them if they were to provide lethal assistance, but we think it’s most effective if we leave that ambiguous and we continue to warn consistently of those consequences,"" Price said.

Experts have argued that the Biden administration might have forced China’s hand after revealing its suspicions that China was considering providing Russia with lethal aid.

CHINA THREATENS US WITH 'CONSEQUENCES' OVER SPYCRAFT SHOOTDOWN, SAYS IT WILL NOT 'FLINCH'

The U.S. and its NATO allies have repeatedly warned that any nation, including China, will see swift and severe economic sanctions if they are found aiding Russia’s war effort.

China has toed the line when it comes to the war in Ukraine, refusing to condemn Russia's invasion but also failing to provide arms to its chief international partner.

In recent weeks Beijing has struggled to keep a balance between maintaining constructive relations with the West while condemning the U.S. of ""hysterics,"" as Beijing did over the shooting down of the surveillance balloon and accusing it of escalating the war by providing defensive aid to Ukraine.

International security experts agree that China is trying to ""strike a balance"" between preserving its economic interests and its desire to see the U.S. fall in the global hierarchy.

""China needs Russia to help it change the rules-based world order,"" former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Europe and NATO Michael Ryan said. ""[Russian President Vladimir Putin] is [Chinese President Xi Jinping’s] partner in trying to undermine U.S. influence in the world and to show that autocracy and not democracy is the superior form of government.""

Ryan explained that the partnership between Russia and China is down to the joint interest of Moscow and Beijing to see Western influence drop to enhance their global ambitions, particularly in the southern hemisphere.

But the ramifications of Chinese lethal aid to Russia could have global consequences.

Security analysts have long argued that the war in Ukraine is about more than the survival of Kyiv, it is a proxy war between Russia and the U.S.

CHINA FURIOUS AFTER US WARNS AGAINST ARMING RUSSIA: ‘THE US IS IN NO POSITION TO TELL CHINA WHAT TO DO’

Providing arms to Russia would have obvious consequences and change the dynamic on the battlefield, making it harder for Ukraine to win.

Ukraine is outmanned when it comes to the sheer number of personnel Russia can dedicate to its front lines, but the training, munitions and defensive aid it is receiving from the West is giving Kyiv an edge on the battlefield — an advantage that could be taken away if Russia is able to start better arming its troops.

""This would increase the odds of the war in Ukraine becoming even more protracted,"" explained James Anderson, the former acting under secretary of defense for policy during the Trump administration. ""The longer the war in Ukraine drags on, the greater the chances it will spread to other countries in Europe.""

Iran and North Korea have already been providing some weaponry to Moscow, and Tehran’s drone contribution has allowed Russia to hit the one area that Ukraine is unable to effectively beat it — air defense.

But Russia needs munitions, tanks and armored vehicles — which is where China could step in and change the course of the war.

Experts agree that China’s involvement in the war would do more than aid Russia’s war effort, it would morph into a new ""Cold War with China.""

""It really would turn into more of a global proxy battle between democracies on one side — the United States and its democratic allies with the Europeans and South Korea, Japan, Australia of course supporting sanctions against Russia — and then on the other side Russia, North Korea, Iran and China,"" Kroenig laid out.

BLINKEN MEETS WITH CHINA'S TOP DIPLOMAT FOR FIRST TIME SINCE DOWNING OF SPY CRAFT

Experts agree that it is unlikely the proxy conflict would lead to direct ground warfare between the U.S. and NATO troops against Russia and Chinese forces — though the conflict brewing over Taiwan could be a different story.

""[China] does not want to see Russia fail because it portends…Western support in terms of [the] Taiwan scenario,"" Heino Klinck, the former deputy assistant secretary of defense for East Asia under the Trump administration, told Fox News.

""The Chinese have been caught by surprise,"" Klinck said pointing to not only Russia’s operational failures on the battlefield but the steadfast response from the U.S. and its Western allies.

Klinck said that the revelation that China is considering arming Russia underscores that there are debates in Beijing over how it should act and the ""strategic calculus"" of its actions.

""What is more important to China: ensuring Russian success?"" he questioned. ""Or is it being part of an international order?""

Ultimately experts agree that China has to consider whether it will more negatively be affected by the strategic implications of a Russian failure and its ally’s standing on the global stage or the economic repercussions that would directly impact Beijing.

""Those domestic implications are always what drive Chinese decision-making,"" Klinck argued.

Anderson also pointed out that the West will need to move quickly to decide how it will respond with economic repercussions should China involve itself in the war effort.

""This would be a real test of Western unity since many European countries have extensive trading relationships with China, and some of our allies and partners may well be reluctant to jeopardize them with sanctions,"" he said. ""Anything less than a massive sanctioning effort would likely fail.""

""History shows that sanctions imposed in a piecemeal fashion have a poor track record of inducing good behavior in bad malign actors,"" he added.

The Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security reacted to the incident by placing six Chinese entities on the Entity List for supporting China's military modernization efforts, specifically those related to aerospace programs.

Companies or other entities added to that list are restricted from obtaining U.S. items and technologies without U.S. government authorization. Gallagher said he supports the Commerce Department's decision, but said more needs to be done because placement on the Entity List does not restrict financial support to those companies.

""In order to buttress these listings, the Treasury Department should also act against PRC companies that are found to support the surveillance balloon program by adding these entities on the Non-SDN Chinese Military Industrial Complex List [NS-CMIC],"" Gallagher wrote.

The NS-CMIC list is designed to impose costs on and prevent U.S. persons from aiding companies that ""operate or have operated in the defense and related material sector or the surveillance technology sector of the economy of the PRC"" or are owned and controlled by such companies.

BIDEN SAYS THREE AERIAL 'OBJECTS' US SHOT DOWN LIKELY NOT RELATED TO CHINA SURVEILLANCE

Gallagher said the six companies recently placed on the Entity List ""clearly"" meet the threshold to be added to the NS-CMIC list.

The six entities are Beijing Nanjiang Aerospace Technology Co.; China Electronics Technology Group Corporation 48th Research Institute; Dongguan Lingkong Remote Sensing Technology Co.; Eagles Men Aviation Science and Technology Group Co.; Guangzhou Tian-Hai-Xiang Aviation Technology Co; and Shanxi Eagles Men Aviation Science and Technology Group Co.

Gallagher also urged the Treasury Department to ""order all entities on the NS-CMIC List to be placed on the ""Specially Designated Entity"" (SDN) list and ""subject them to full blocking sanctions.""

""SDN-Listed companies’ assets are blocked, and U.S. persons are prohibited from transacting with them, effectively cutting them off from the U.S.-led global finance system,"" Gallagher wrote. ""Only by placing the PRC companies involved in the balloon program on the SDN List can the Biden administration send a strong message to these entities and to ensure U.S. persons and technology do not aid the surveillance program.""

Aside from those suggestions, Gallagher explained that the Department of Defense maintains its own list of Chinese military companies, which serve as ""military-civil fusion contributors to the Chinese defense industrial base."" But he said there are some companies on the Pentagon's list that are not on the NS-CMIC list, and suggested Treasury should add them.

US BLACKLISTS CHINESE COMPANIES, RESEARCH INSTITUTE OVER SUSPECTED SPY BALLOON

One of those companies is China National Chemical Corporation, or ChemChina.

""This is notable, because a ChemChina subsidiary dominates the PRC high altitude ballon market, making 75% of the high-altitude balloons used by the China Meteorological Administration,"" Gallagher wrote. He said the U.S. ""has not yet discovered whether ChemChina has contributed to the PRC’s surveillance balloon program.""

""However, ChemChina is precisely the sort of company that the U.S. government should have sanctioned long ago and should do so now,"" he said. Gallagher said there are likely ""hundreds or thousands of additional PRC companies that meet the threshold"" to be included on the NS-CMIC List, but have not yet been added.

Gallagher also requested a briefing from Yellen for the House China Select Committee ""as expeditiously as possible,"" to discuss companies that have ties to the PRC. He used his letter to press Yellen for answers on whether the U.S. government has any evidence about technology produced ""in whole or in part"" by U.S. entities used in the PRC spy balloon program, and whether that will ""affect Treasury’s decision-making process.""

In the last two weeks, U.S. military fighter jets shot down at least four aerial objects , including a Chinese spy balloon that flew across country from Alaska to South Carolina over an eight-day stretch.

President Biden addressed the situation for the first time on Thursday, more than two weeks after the initial Chinese spy flight that traveled across the continental United States for several days.

11,China sharply criticizes Pentagon after defense official visited Taiwan,"On Wednesday, the Chinese Foreign Office sharply criticized the United States after a senior Defense Department official visited Taiwan.

China’s Taiwan Affairs Office spokesperson Zhu Fenglian accused the U.S. and Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party of attempting to push the island’s independence from China and discouraged the alleged efforts.

China ""resolutely opposes any official interaction and military collaboration"" between the two countries, Zhu said Wednesday, further underscoring tensions between Beijing and Washington, D.C. over Taiwan.

The comment comes after Michael Chase, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for China, visited Taiwan amid Chinese military movements in the Pacific Ocean and the East China Sea.

CHINA FURIOUS AFTER US WARNS AGAINST ARMING RUSSIA: ‘THE US IS IN NO POSITION TO TELL CHINA WHAT TO DO’

Zhu also reaffirmed the Chinese government’s sanction on Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, both U.S.-located companies that supply military equipment to the self-governing island.

Officially, the U.S. and most of the international community observe the One China policy that says China has sovereignty over Taiwan, though the island self-governs.

The spokesperson also told reporters such alleged cooperation between Taiwan and the U.S. to push for the island's independence is ""doomed to failure.""

China has said it will maintain its control over Taiwan by force if necessary, often using its military and diplomatic efforts to exercise the control. The sides split amid a civil war in 1949.

The Pentagon did not comment directly on Chase's visit but repeated its ""commitment to Taiwan is rock-solid and contributes to the maintenance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and within the region,"" the Associated Press reported.

Taiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs also did not address the visit.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin similarly accused the U.S. of coordinating a push for independence and said a ""new round of tensions"" in the Taiwan Strait was the result of such attempts to ""seek independence with U.S. support, as well as the U.S. intention to contain China with Taiwan.""

""We urge the U.S. to ... stop any form of official U.S.-Taiwan contacts, stop meddling in the Taiwan issue and stop creating new factors of tension in the Taiwan Strait,"" Wang said Wednesday.

Tensions between the U.S. and China remain unsteady as Washington accused Beijing of using a balloon that carried surveillance capabilities that soared over the continental U.S. before it was shot down off the coast of South Carolina.

CHINA THREATENS US WITH 'CONSEQUENCES' OVER SPYCRAFT SHOOTDOWN, SAYS IT WILL NOT 'FLINCH'

Immediately following the spy balloon controversy, Secretary of State Antony Blinken canceled a trip to Beijing and the U.S. continues to criticize communication between China and Russia over the latter’s invasion of Ukraine.

China, in response, said it has ""no limits"" in its friendship with Russia and instead blames the U.S. and NATO for provoking the Kremlin.

""The U.S. is the biggest source of weaponry for the battlefield in Ukraine,"" Wang said during the briefing. ""We do not accept the U.S.’s finger-pointing or even coercion targeting China-Russia relations. The U.S. should seriously reflect on what it has done, stop fanning the flames or profiting from it, and stay truly committed to promoting peace talks as China has been doing.""

A delegation of U.S. lawmakers — including Reps. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., Tony Gonzales, R-Texas, Jake Auchincloss, D-MA, and Jonathan Jackson, D-Illin. — visited Taiwan earlier this week as part of their five-day visit.

On Monday, the delegation met with the head of the legislature and the following day they met with President Tsai Ing-wen and other officials.

12,Navy pilot made crucial error before crashing F-35C into USS Carl Vinson in South China Sea,"A U.S. Navy investigation is reportedly placing blame on a mistake by a pilot for the crash of an F-35C Lightning II jet into the deck of a U.S. aircraft carrier in the South China Sea last year.

A report shared with Military.com showed investigators concluded that the Jan. 24 crash – which involved the USS Carl Vinson – was the result of the pilot choosing to perform a specialized landing but failing to switch on electronic aides in the plane.

Video of the incident circulated on social media, and several sailors were injured. The pilot managed to eject safely.

The report said the crash caused millions of dollars in damage to another plane and hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage to the deck of the carrier.

NAVY SEAL KILLED IN FREE-FALL PARACHUTE ACCIDENT IN ARIZONA

It identified the pilot only by his rank of lieutenant and said he had wanted to try an ""expedited recovery maneuver"" known as the ""Sierra Hotel Break"" or SHB.

The outlet said the SHB was described by the Navy as ""when an aircraft initiates a turn to downwind from either behind the ship or over the top of the ship … [using] G-forces to decelerate over the course of a 360-degree turn, dropping the landing gear when the aircraft is below landing gear transition speed."" It says a pilot has a ""reduced amount of time to configure the aircraft and conduct landing checks.""

The lieutenant reportedly didn't turn on the Approach Power Compensation Mode (APC) or the Delta Flight Path (DFP). The APC maintains the jet at the right angle and the DFP automatically adjusts the throttle.

AVIATION MILESTONE: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FLEW A MODIFIED F-16 FIGHTER JET FOR OVER 17 HOURS

The landing signals officer told the pilot to hit the afterburners in the moment caught on video, with entire incident lasting four around five minutes.

The plane sank into the ocean and was salvaged by the Navy in March of last year.

The Navy did not immediately respond to multiple requests for comment from Fox News Digital, but Navy spokesman Cmdr. Zach Harrell told Military.com that the pilot ""is no longer in a flying status in the U.S. Navy, but will continue to serve as a Naval officer.""

13,The real Chinese spies are attacking America from within,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

The Chinese spy balloons are an obvious infiltration into America. Less obvious, but equally perilous, is China’s role in the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) movement. But over the past few weeks, it has become more apparent that the ESG agenda is the China-ESG agenda.

A few weeks ago, I was in Indiana testifying in support of a House bill calling for fiduciary responsibility to take precedence over political ideology in pension fund management. At the hearing, the bankers’ association showed up and touted research done by the Wharton School of Business. The research claimed that costs ""could"" increase significantly if the bill was passed.

The Houston Chronicle used the same research, claiming that the University of Pennsylvania and the Federal Reserve System say ""Texas cities incurred an additional $300 million to $500 million in interest on $31.8 billion in bonds"" after Texas passed a law prohibiting the use of ESG in taxpayer-funded investments.

CHINA SURVEILLANCE: GALLAGHER DEMANDS TREASURY BLOCK PRC COMPANIES INVOLVED IN SPY PROGRAM

But it wasn’t just the University of Pennsylvania that conducted the study. The claim comes from a ""new analysis"" that was ""conducted by Econsult Solutions on behalf of The Sunrise Project — a nonprofit focused on climate change."" The Sunrise Project’s opening statement on their website gives their allegiance to the ""climate crisis"" and claims that ""an energy revolution is moving the world beyond fossil fuels. How, and how fast that revolution happens will determine the future of humanity."" It’s hardly a politically neutral source.

The Sunrise Project ""commissioned"" Econsult to ""use the econometric analysis of Texas and its findings to provide estimates of the potential financial impacts on taxpayers,"" in other words, to rig the results by making a biased corporation create a biased study.

It’s not ""analysis."" It’s an outburst by aligned organizations realizing that states that won’t do business with BlackRock, Vanguard, etc. will inhibit their mission to destroy fossil fuels. Doing so, no matter its pace, would also destroy capitalism. It would subject the future of humanity to abject poverty, because affordable and reliable energy is the key to human flourishing.

They know this perfectly well. The Sunrise Project’s consultants gave an editorial comment that the Houston Chronicle buried at the end of the article: ""encroachments into the marketplace by political actors…will have adverse effects on long-term public investments, including public program and state pensions.""

But the best interest of American families isn’t the goal of the ESG movement. If you peel back the layers of the onion, it’s clear Wall Street isn’t only pushing the leftist agenda, it’s fighting for China’s agenda. The People’s Republic of China has given about $30 million to the University of Pennsylvania — just a few months before this new study was released by the University’s Wharton School of Business, the same school hosts The ESG Initiative.

BlackRock has shown clear favoritism by giving Chinese companies better ESG scores than American companies, even though American companies are the most environmentally responsible in the world. BlackRock is a part of Climate Action 100+, whose primary investor networks include the Asia Investor Group on Climate Change and includes several Chinese groups, as reported by Heritage Action executive director Jessica Anderson.

And BlackRock owns 7.2% of PetroChina, a fossil fuel-based Chinese company, despite publicly railing against fossil fuels and preaching about the climate ""crisis.""

Boycotting financial institutions that place ESG principles on a pedestal over fiduciary duty is the only way to remove political actors from the marketplace. ESG is a political tool to subvert the democratic process and force the political ideology of the globalist elites on the rest of us.

The results of letting woke companies rule the market would be nothing short of dystopian. And we cannot allow ourselves to think that China is only testing us by hovering spy balloons over our land.

14,"China accuses US of 'fanning the flames' in Ukraine, claims US is 'profiting' from war","China dismissed criticism from the U.S. about its apparent support for Russia in its invasion of Ukraine on Tuesday, accusing the U.S. of ""fanning the flames"" of conflict in the region.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin attempted to turn the tables on the U.S. during a Tuesday press briefing after the U.S. accused China of potentially providing lethal aid to Russia. Wang said the U.S. defense industry is profiting from the conflict and compared the situation to the war in Afghanistan.

""U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken recently said that China knows that there would be consequences were China to provide lethal assistance to Russia. But he refused to lay out what the consequences would be if China ignored the warning. What’s your comment?"" a reporter asked.

President Joe Biden on Tuesday challenged Russian President Vladimir Putin to ""end the war"" against Ukraine and warned that the U.S. and its allies around the world will continue to support Ukraine and push for new sanctions on the Kremlin.

The broadsides from the U.S. and China come as Russia's invasion nears the one-year mark and as Ukrainian officials warn of a renewed offensive.

Putin himself withdrew Russia from the New START nuclear treaty with the U.S. on Tuesday, threatening to resume testing nuclear weapons.

The New START treaty, first signed in April 2010, limits the U.S. and Russia from having more than 1,550 nuclear warheads deployed on delivery systems like intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles or heavy bombers.

""I would say no one comes out the winner here,"" Craig Singleton from the Foundation for Defense of Democracies told Fox News Digital.

""Ukraine will have been devastated [and] it will require billions of dollars in reconstruction money that the Western world, including the United States, will largely be responsible for providing,"" Singleton said. ""Russia, however the scenario unfolds here, is likely severely weakened, still under massive international sanctions.""

""It’s difficult for me to see a scenario where there are any winners here,"" he said.

BIDEN VOWS TO ‘DEFEND LITERALLY EVERY INCH OF NATO’ TERRITORY: ‘ARTICLE 5 IS A SACRED COMMITMENT’

Russian President Vladimir Putin declared the start of a ""special military operation"" to ""denazify"" Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, deploying troops across Ukraine’s eastern border while also sending troops to take control of the capital city, Kyiv.

Putin reportedly believed that the entire operation would take only a few days, and Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley echoed that sentiment as one of five possible outcomes if Russia launched an invasion of Ukraine, saying that Kyiv could fall in as little as 72 hours.

""In early February 2022, Chairman Milley and several other officials briefed lawmakers during a classified briefing on the pending Russian invasion,"" Col. Dave Butler, spokesman for Chairman Milley, told Fox News Digital. ""In the briefing, Chairman Milley laid out several scenarios informed by interagency intelligence assessments, on the far end of a range of possibilities was the Russians taking Kyiv in several days. This is what we assessed the Russians planned to do.""

The intelligence about Russia’s capabilities ultimately proved egregiously wrong as Ukraine dug in its heels and maintained a staunch defense, supported by NATO and Western allies who supplied the country with weapons and supplies to wage an asymmetric war that has helped it reach the one-year mark unbeaten.

RUSSIAN UNION SUSPENDED FROM INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION OF JOURNALISTS FOR ACTIONS FOLLOWING UKRAINE INVASION

That defense has come at significant costs, which Russia expert Rebekah Koffler highlighted as a major concern moving forward, regardless of the conflict’s outcome.

""Putin and Russia are clear losers,"" Koffler, president of Doctrine & Strategy Consulting and a former DIA intelligence officer, told Fox News Digital. ""Putin committed basically demographic suicide. Estimates are that Russia lost about 200,000 personnel either to death or injury, and he’s additionally mobilizing 1.5 million troops, preparing for a protracted war.""

""On top of that, Russia has become a pariah in the West; they’re not welcome in any way,"" she continued. ""Putin is hated everywhere – not that he cares about that.""

Koffler also argued that Ukraine is a ""clear loser"" due to its staggering losses in industrial and agricultural bases, devastated energy infrastructure and the slow slide away from true independence.

PUTIN TOUTS DEVELOPING RELATIONSHIP WITH CHINA AS FEARS OF PROXY WAR IN UKRAINE LOOM

""[Ukraine] is going to permanently depend on the West for its gross domestic product, with the U.S. leading the rest of the countries with $196 billion in total military, financial and humanitarian aid,"" Koffler said.

Koffler picked out only one clear winner from the conflict: China, which has seen its two biggest powerhouse competitors severely depleted through the conflict – as well as having some kind of preview of how the West might react to a Taiwan invasion scenario.

""China is witnessing two of its top perceived adversaries decimating each other’s weapons stockpiles. They’re using a lot of weaponry,"" she said. ""Some of these weapon systems will take from five to 18 years to replace.""

""We simply don’t have the production capacity to replace everything that we need, and in a potential conflict with China, that will be a big problem; and China has also witnessed the Western response to Russia’s strategies, and it can start planning counter-strategies.""

SEN. ROGER WICKER: BIDEN NEEDS TO MATCH HIS SPEECH WITH ACTION

Singleton, whose expertise focuses on China, agreed that Beijing will be closely monitoring the outcome of the war to determine where it stands with Russia, but China has already been able to negotiate ""very favorable energy deals.""

He also acknowledged that regardless of the outcome, Russia remains vulnerable to Chinese predation and could end up ""a vassal,"" but the relatively ""unproductive"" economy in Russia would make it more of a problem for Beijing.

""China will be eager to take advantage of opportunities to negotiate cheap, secure supplies of energy to meet its insatiable demand for energy resources, but at the same time, if the Chinese are perceived to have to keep Russia afloat, that is likely, I think, to exacerbate existing tension between the two countries,"" Singleton said.

Estonian Minister of Foreign Affairs Urmas Reinsalu told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview that there would be ""tectonic differences"" in Europe’s power balance after the war, especially if Russia faced total failure.

RUSSIAN PILOT KILLED ON EVE OF UKRAINE INVASION ANNIVERSARY AFTER SUPPOSED ‘MALFUNCTION’ STRIKES JET

""I think Central Asian countries, Caucasus countries, Moldova and, I think … from his fortification, also [President of Belarus Alexander] Lukashenko,"" Reinsalu said. ""Because if Ukraine wins the war, I think it will surely also [be] the protest of the president of Belarus, people against the regime, and also surely I think the outcome of war could be also a game changer.""

Reinsalu called the outcome of the war decisive ""not only for Ukrainians but for many other countries."" He also stressed the need for a tribunal to investigate Russia for alleged war crimes, which Ukraine claims to have documented at least 60,000.

Victoria Coates, senior research fellow at the Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom and former National Security Council official for the Trump administration, praised some NATO allies for stepping up to support Ukraine, which she thinks has also helped position them for a more stable future defense.

16,Republicans blast Washington Post op-ed by CCP official: ‘Worst kind of Chinese propaganda’,"FIRST ON FOX: Republicans are irate after The Washington Post published an op-ed by a top Chinese Communist Party official who claimed the U.S. overreacted to a ""wandering balloon"" and wounded relations with China.

The Post allowed Xu Xueyuan, the chargé d’affaires at Beijing’s embassy in Washington, to publish an op-ed last week claiming the Chinese spy balloon that was shot down by the U.S. military earlier this month was a civilian weather balloon that ""unintentionally entered U.S. airspace because of the westerlies and its limited self-steering capability.""

""The United States labeled the airship as China’s ‘spy balloon’ of the People’s Liberation Army, and shot it down, though it posed no real security threat,"" she claimed. ""The overreaction by America — and its moves to heighten the issue — have exacerbated the situation. This isolated incident has caused new wounds in China-U.S. relations.""

""We sincerely hope that the United States will work with China and not allow a wandering balloon to lead the bilateral relationship astray,"" she added.

TIMELINE: FOURTH FLYING OBJECT DOWNED BY US MILITARY IN 8 DAYS

Xu’s op-ed is repeating the CCP’s narrative that the balloon was a civilian aircraft gone adrift, but senior U.S. military and national security officials have already confirmed it was tied to a major surveillance program that has been largely run out of China’s Hainan Island province off its southeast coastline in the South China Sea by the People’s Liberation Army (PLA).

U.S. officials say the Chinese program collects intelligence from nations that are of strategic interest to Beijing. Chinese spy balloons have been spotted for years in multiple parts of the world, including Latin America and the Middle East.

The Post's communications manager, Azhar AlFadl Miranda, told Fox News Digital, ""The Washington Post Opinion page regularly publishes a variety of viewpoints.""

Republicans who spoke with Fox News Digital slammed The Post for giving Xu a platform to repeat Communist propaganda.

""Democracy dies in darkness – it also dies in communist China,"" said Rep. Brian Mast, R-Fla., who sits on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. ""Everyone knows it wasn’t a weather balloon. It’s absurd that the Washington Post is giving the CCP the platform it needs to spew propaganda while it sends spy balloons, buys up our farmland, steals our intellectual property, and spies on our kids via TikTok. Those are the real causes of the ‘wounds’ in the American-Chinese relationship.""

""The strategic threats that America faces from China are only growing more severe, and the White House has unfortunately met Beijing aggression with repeated Biden weakness,"" said Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., another Foreign Affairs Committee member. ""Additionally, the Washington Post does itself no favors by allowing its pages to be used as an amplification platform for the worst kind of Chinese propaganda.""

""Xu Xueyuan repeating lies at the behest of a genocidal regime in the Washington Post is just another example of how the Chinese Communist Party has figured out how to use America’s openness against us,"" said Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

""Communist China’s attempt to play nice and cover up their surveillance operation is not the least bit surprising,"" said Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn. ""This is what they do — pretend everything is fine and dandy while they continue to spy on Americans using TikTok, steal our intellectual property, and buy up our farmland. America did not overreact. If anything, we didn’t act soon enough. The Biden administration should make it crystal clear to Beijing: next time they think about flying a spy balloon near the U.S., we won’t wait a week to shoot it down.""

""’A wandering civilian balloon.’ Yeah, we buy that,"" said Rep. Clay Higgins, R-La., a member of the House Committee on Homeland Security. ""Well, Ms. Xu Xueyuan has certainly not wandered from the Communist Party line. The CCP is not to be trusted. Communist oppression is a threat to the entire world and every citizen of every nation should be aware of the CCP global agenda. When we put Trump back in the WH, China will back up very, very fast.""

""The Washington Post publishing communist propaganda is a surprise to no one,"" added Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo.

Xu’s op-ed comes several months after she praised China’s so-called ""re-education"" of Uyghurs, a Muslim minority, in Xinjiang, which the U.S. has described as genocide. Xu said the U.S. government and media are feeding Americans ""lies"" and being influenced by ""anti-China forces"" about what's going on in Xinjiang.

""What we are asking of the United States is, please respect our perspective because we have a very special national condition,"" she told ""Sinica"" podcast. ""And we believe that we have the right to enforce our policies, to adopt our policies, and solve our issues according to how we understand it.""

""I don’t think all Americans understand or are willing to try to understand what is going on in Xinjiang,"" she continued, lamenting that some Americans ""attach different importance to the concept of human rights.""

""And actually, we are very proud for what is being achieved in Xinjiang, because our way of countering terrorism and extremism are more effective than the Western practices,"" she claimed. ""These are very effective ways for those people to stay away from extreme ideology and terrorism.

This isn’t just some trivia to impress your friends at your next get-together, but to illustrate Alaska’s critical importance to our national defense.

At just a few miles from Russian territory, just a few hours from China, and within potential striking distance of North Korean missiles, Alaska is truly a frontier outpost standing on the front lines in between a rough neighborhood and North America.

Of the four objects shot down since Feb. 4, three have transited Alaska, and two were shot down by F-22 Raptors based at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, or JBER, in Anchorage on consecutive days Feb. 10 and 11.

There is much we still don’t know about these incidents, and the Biden administration did little to reassure the public on Feb. 16 by announcing that the three objects shot down after the Chinese spy balloon were likely harmless private craft conducting some kind of research.

Not only that, but intelligence officials are now telling the public that the U.S. tracked the Chinese spy balloon from the moment it took off and still allowed it to transit the entire nation from Hawaii to Alaska to South Carolina.

Alaska – already home to long-range radar, missile defense interceptors, and more fifth-generation fighter jets than anywhere in the world – will naturally be at the forefront of these efforts, and we stand ready to support our national defense as we always have dating to before statehood.

How a hostile act went unanswered for days while other, apparently benign, objects were shot down immediately, is a question that remains unanswered.

One fact is clear, however, based on the two subsequent shootdowns: the Defense assets in Alaska were capable of stopping this Chinese spy balloon before it reached the Lower 48.

Intercepting Russian reconnaissance craft, fighter jets, and bombers is nothing new here in Alaska. On Feb. 13, two Russian bombers and two fighter jets were intercepted in the Alaska Air Defense Identification Zone. (This isn’t U.S. airspace, but rather the boundary that triggers a military response when it’s approached or entered.)

Last August, Alaska-based pilots intercepted Russian reconnaissance planes on three straight days during Air Force Red Flag training exercises.

These intercepts have thankfully occurred without incident, as well-trained pilots on both sides of the border understand the rules and norms of engagement and conduct themselves accordingly.

In contrast, high-altitude unmanned balloons or other flying objects with unknown payloads represent a potentially new challenge that will require a new response.

Alaska – already home to long-range radar, missile defense interceptors, and more fifth-generation fighter jets than anywhere in the world – will naturally be at the forefront of these efforts, and we stand ready to support our national defense as we always have dating to before statehood.

The potential threat from unmanned aircraft isn’t the only emerging situation that the U.S. must be prepared for where Alaska is on the front lines.

More traditional displays of naval power have been increasing in recent years from both Russia and China.

Last September, the Coast Guard cutter Kimball on routine patrol in the Bering Sea encountered three Chinese and four Russian ships moving in a single formation, including a Chinese guided missile cruiser and a Russian destroyer, about 86 miles north of Kiska.

A little more than a year earlier, the Kimball encountered four Chinese ships sailing within 46 miles of the Aleutians.

As China and Russia strengthen their ties amid the Ukraine conflict, they’ve pledged to increase their cooperation in the Arctic. We need to take this seriously and prepare accordingly.

One fact is clear, however, based on the two subsequent shootdowns: the Defense assets in Alaska were capable of stopping this Chinese spy balloon before it reached the Lower 48.

Again, Alaska stands ready. In fact, we are already home to a former naval base on the island of Adak that was constructed in 1942 in preparation for the battle to eject Japanese invaders from U.S. territory after they bombed Dutch Harbor and occupied Attu and Kiska.

Once home to as many as 6,000 Naval personnel, Adak was decommissioned in 1997 during post-Cold War base closures. It would take time and expense to reopen this base, but the possibility should be considered so long as China and Russia increase their cooperation and Naval activity in U.S. waters off the coast of Alaska.

One asset where the U.S. desperately needs to catch up is our inadequate number of icebreakers.

The U.S. is an Arctic nation because of Alaska, yet we are woefully behind with just two aging vessels compared to Russia’s fleet of more than 50. China, which has declared itself a ""near Arctic nation"", has the same number of icebreakers that we do, and is building more as we speak.

""This is obviously among the most consequential but also complex relationships that we have and probably the same can be said by many other countries around the world, and of course, we’re in a vigorous competition with China and that’s something we’re not at all shy about,"" Blinken told NBC host Chuck Todd during an interview aired on ""Meet the Press"" Sunday.

Todd, noting how the U.S. is expanding its military presence in Guam, the Philippines and Australia, helping Japan change its national security posture and continuing to arm Taiwan, challenged Blinken, ""If it's not a Cold War, what is it?""

""We intend to compete very vigorously. We’ve taken important steps over the last couple of years to invest in ourselves so that we can compete effectively, but also to align with allies and partners around the world so that we have a shared approach to some of the challenges that China poses,"" Blinken continued in response. ""And as we’re doing that, we have a strong interest in trying to manage the relationship responsibly and to make sure to the best of our ability that competition doesn’t veer into conflict or into Cold War.""

BLINKEN ISSUES WARNING TO CHINA ABOUT SPY CRAFT IN ‘CONFRONTATIONAL’ MEETING WITH COUNTERPART

""I don’t think that’s in our interests. And also, it’s important to note, that there are some very big issues out there that are affecting all of our citizens and are affecting people around the world where if we can it would be in our interest to find ways to cooperate. On climate, on global health, on the macroeconomic situation around the world,"" he added. ""And we have a responsibility to at least try to do that. So that’s why I saw you can’t reduce this to a bumper sticker or to a label. It’s complicated. It’s consequential. And we need to manage it responsibly.""

Blinken also appeared on ABC’s ""This Week"" and CBS’ ""Face the Nation"" on the heels of what’s been reported as a ""confrontational"" meeting with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference. Blinken reportedly spoke directly to Wang about the ""unacceptable violation of U.S. sovereignty and international law"" by China flying a high-altitude surveillance balloon across the U.S., warning that the ""irresponsibly act must never again occur.""

Blinken confirmed to ABC host Martha Raddatz that the Chinese diplomat offered no apology for the episode.

On the contrary, Wang said at the Munich Security Conference that the U.S. military shooting down the Chinese spycraft off the coast of South Carolina, after the surveillance balloon was detected above Montana and traversed the U.S., was ""absurd"" and ""hysterical,"" claiming ""Cold War mentality is back.""

""More than 40 countries have had these balloons go over their territory,"" Blinken told ABC. ""So there’s a real concern I’m hearing here from other countries, allies and partners alike, about this program. And I think countries are – I was going to say pleased, but pleased is the wrong word. They appreciate the fact that we’ve exposed it.""

""Once over the United States, the balloon attempted to surveil very critical, important military installations. We protected the sensitive information that it was trying to surveil,"" Blinken told Raddatz. ""At the same time, we got information about the balloon itself as was traversing the country going west to east. And then when it was safe to do so, there was no danger to people on the ground, President Biden ordered that it be shot down.""

Blinken said he also warned Wang that there would be consequences for China sending ""lethal support"" to Russia in the war against Ukraine.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/blinken-bats-down-idea-us-cold-war-china-relations-cant-be-reduced-bumper-sticker,N/A
20,Blinken issues warning to China about spy craft in 'confrontational' meeting with counterpart,"Secretary of State Antony Blinken held a meeting with his Chinese counterpart Saturday night in Germany, warning that the flight of a Chinese surveillance balloon across the United States ""must never happen again.""

The New York Times reported that American officials described the nature of the meeting as ""confrontational.""

In a statement from the State Department on the meeting with PRC State Councilor and Director of the CCP Central Foreign Affairs Office Wang Yi, spokesman Ned Price said Blinken ""directly spoke to the unacceptable violation of U.S. sovereignty and international law by the PRC high-altitude surveillance balloon in U.S. territorial airspace, underscoring that this irresponsible act must never again occur.""

Blinken, meeting with Wang on the margins of the Munich Security Conference on Saturday, ""made clear the United States will not stand for any violation of our sovereignty, and that the PRC’s high altitude surveillance balloon program — which has intruded into the air space of over 40 countries across 5 continents —has been exposed to the world,"" Price wrote.

BLINKEN MEETS WITH CHINA'S TOP DIPLOMAT FOR FIRST TIME SINCE DOWNING OF SPYCRAFT

The U.S. Secretary of State also ""warned about the implications and consequences if China provides material support to Russia or assistance with systemic sanctions evasion,"" Price wrote.

Blinken condemned the ICBM test by the DPRK ""as the latest destabilizing act carried out by Pyongyang and emphasized the need for responsible powers to respond to such significant international challenges.""

He also ""reaffirmed there had been no change to the longstanding U.S. One China policy, and he underscored the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.""

Blinken ""reiterated President Biden’s statements that the United States will compete and will unapologetically stand up for our values and interests, but that we do not want conflict with the PRC and are not looking for a new Cold War,"" Price added. ""The Secretary underscored the importance of maintaining diplomatic dialogue and open lines of communication at all times.""

John Kirby, coordinator for Strategic Communications at the National Security Council, said on ""Fox News Sunday"" that ""Blinken had a very forthright, very candid exchange with the foreign minister of China"" and that ""we sent a loud and clear message to China that that’s not acceptable.""

He also said that now the U.S. can ""exploit that debris"" and ""learn more about this system."" Regarding the other objects shot down, Kirby said they're ""probably for benign purposes"" but couldn't be sure at the time, noting their altitude posed a danger to commercial airline flights.

Price’s statement did not describe how Wang responded to Blinken, but according to the Times, a summary from Chinese state-run media said it was up to the United States to ""solve the damage caused by the indiscriminate use of force"" when the U.S. military show down the surveillance balloon off the coast of South Carolina.

The meeting resumed diplomatic contact between Washington and Beijing for the first time since the controversy. Blinked had canceled a planned trip to China as the suspected Chinese spy craft detected over Montana drifted across the continental U.S.

In an interview with NBC’s ""Meet the Press"" aired Saturday, Blinken said he spoke ""very clearly and very directly about the fact that China sent a surveillance balloon over our territory, violating our sovereignty, violating international law."" He added, however, that Wang offered ""no apology"" for the incident.

Speaking on the second day of the annual Munich Security Conference, Wang ridiculed the United States’ response to the spy craft, saying ""To have dispatched an advanced fighter jet to shoot down a balloon with a missile, such behavior is unbelievable, almost hysterical.""

""There are so many balloons all over the world, and various countries have them, so is the United States going to shoot all of them down?,"" he added. ""We ask the U.S. to show its sincerity and correct its mistakes, face up and resolve this incident, which has damaged Sino-U.S. relations.""

Drones can be helpful for all kinds of reasons, and as this one can both fly and swim underwater, it's safe to assume that it can be used for some great missions.

Some missions for the technology could include taking aerial and aquatic surveys, remote sensing, and search-and-rescue operations.

Professor Ben Chen from the Chinese University of Hong Kong and his colleagues will be presenting a paper on their research on the drone at the 2023 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation in London this May.

So until that happens, we'll be watching to see what kind of other work the TJ-FlyingFish may be used for.

22,War in Ukraine: Here's how we defeat Russia and deter China,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

One year ago on Feb. 24, the first major conflict between the world’s autocracies and democracies began with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Fortunately, a unified West pushed back against Vladimir Putin’s murderous assault, marking an historical moment when we stood on principle.

The war has since been a failure for Moscow in multiple ways. Notably is the Russian military’s incompetence, exposed by the skill, courage and tenacity of much smaller Ukrainian forces that not only denied Putin a quick victory, but also demonstrated the ability of a determined people to beat back a larger foe – an important lesson for China and Taiwan.

The war has stalemated since Ukraine’s successful counteroffensive last fall. It cannot be allowed to harden into another ""frozen conflict."" As such, we should pause on this gruesome anniversary to assess how best to facilitate victory for Kyiv and send the right signals to Moscow (and Beijing).

Western unity has proven the most important factor in hampering Russia’s war effort and enabling Ukraine’s. The U.S. has done a good job keeping the allies together and moving forward. This must be sustained. But what is lacking is a clear sense of how Washington wants this conflict to end and then resourcing that outcome.

UKRAINE WAR ANNIVERSARY: TIME FOR RUSSIAN SANCTIONS WITH REAL TEETH

Regarding the former, we should follow the lead of Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who said Russia must completely leave his country, including Crimea. That may be difficult for Moscow to accept, but we should not allow Putin’s saber rattling to deter us. A year of his bluster has proven fears of escalation to be overblown.

On the latter, while U.S. support has been strong, the Biden administration has been frustratingly late in providing Kyiv what it needs. Weapons systems like HIMARS, Patriots and now Abrams tanks, arrive long after Ukraine suffers needlessly. We seem to be doing just enough to prevent a Ukrainian loss, but not nearly enough to enable a Ukrainian win.

Zelenskyy has long asked for ATACMS. Now he is seeking modern fighter jets – critical to supporting a counteroffensive – but once again Washington begins with ""No.""

Why not start training Ukrainians on F-16s now, or assembling a volunteer cadre of former pilots and maintainers, pending a final decision that is likely to be approved anyway? Ukraine can’t afford to get pummeled for months awaiting aircraft, much like they are now desperate for tanks as a Russian offensive slowly begins.

Other actions should be taken to tighten the noose on Putin and signal our resolve, such as stiffening sanctions on Russia and those who aid them. Additionally, all our allies – not just a stalwart few – should contribute their fair share to the war effort. It’s time for everyone to step up.

Meanwhile, Turkish President Recep Erdogan has played domestic politics, demanding unreasonable concessions, over NATO accession for Finland and Sweden – two democracies that would clearly enhance the alliance. Biden needs to turn up the heat on his dubious counterpart.

After all, we need a robust and ready NATO to not only empower Ukraine, but to deter Russian misadventures elsewhere, while also dissuading China from acting against Taiwan. An alliance-wide agreement to spend no less than 2% of GDP on defense – something I long advocated – would underscore our resolve.

Time is not on Ukraine’s side. Every passing day is another opportunity for Western support to weaken or fracture. Putin is counting on it. Moreover, before Russia can adapt to global sanctions and rebuild its forces, we must give Kyiv the means to win quickly and decisively. This makes many uneasy, but Ukraine’s future is on the line, and Beijing is taking notes.

Importantly, the U.S. must continue to lead. This means keeping the West unified and less self-deterred; surging the defense industrial base for the global long haul; and providing continued assistance, all properly accounted for, to Kyiv.

Frequent messaging at home, framed in the broader strategic contest at hand, is important to sustain public support and congressional funding. And finally, we should push similar support to Taiwan now, before Beijing acts.

This all comes at some expense, for sure, but deterring war is less costly than fighting one, and winning costs less than losing. But defending freedom against autocracies like Russia and China that only respect strength, will keep us all safer in the long run.

23,China and the US are locked in a cold war. We must win it. Here's how we will,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

PROGRAMMING ALERT: Watch House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy discuss this topic and more on ‘The Story with Martha MacCallum' at 3 pm ET.

The greatest threat to the United States is the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). America spent decades pursuing policies that welcomed China into the international system. But since then, instead of embracing freedom or becoming a responsible stakeholder, Beijing has flouted international norms while exporting totalitarianism, aggression, and ideological control.

To win the new Cold War, we must respond to Chinese aggression with tough policies to strengthen our economy, rebuild our supply chains, speak out for human rights, stand against military aggression, and end the theft of Americans’ personal information, intellectual property, and jobs.

We must recognize that China’s ""peaceful rise"" was pure fiction and finally confront the CCP with the urgency the threat demands. To do that, House Republicans will establish a Select Committee on China in the new Congress.

CHINA PUTS THE WORLD AT MORE RISK THAN EVER BEFORE

Here's the good news: when the threat is dire, Americans have a proud history of coming together. There is bipartisan consensus that the era of trusting Communist China is over.

Two years ago, House Republicans proposed to create a bipartisan China Task Force. Sadly, Democrats refused to participate, but the Task Force released a comprehensive blueprint built on bipartisan proposals on how to confront the CCP. The establishment of the Select Committee on China will build on the work first laid out by that China Task Force, and it will do it in a bipartisan way.

The first step is to restore our supply chains and end critical economic dependencies on China. In 2021, the U.S. imported a quarter of its antibiotics from China. India, a key producer of generic drugs, depends on China for 80% of the underlying active pharmaceutical ingredients–demonstrating that even ostensibly friendly sources of lifesaving drugs oftentimes ultimately trace back to China.

prev next Image 2 of 5

prev next Image 4 of 5

prev Image 5 of 5

Meanwhile, in 2019, approximately 90% of the world’s rare earth metals, alloys, and permanent magnets were produced in China. The Select Committee will expose our dangerous dependence on China and advance policies to build secure sources for critical supply chains, either in the United States or in partnership with like-minded allies.

To win the new Cold War, we must respond to Chinese aggression with tough policies to strengthen our economy, rebuild our supply chains, speak out for human rights, stand against military aggression, and end the theft of Americans’ personal information, intellectual property, and jobs.

It will also work to prevent trillions of American dollars and millions of American retirees from financing communist genocide and military modernization by developing policies to prohibit state and local pension funds—the same entities evangelizing for environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investments—from investing in China. Our goal will be to promote overwhelming economic superiority. When we have a strong economy, we are safer.

PROTESTS IN CHINA ARE ABOUT MUCH MORE THAN COVID LOCKDOWNS

Confronting China is also about deterring aggression on the world stage, both military and economic. Taiwan and other allies increasingly find themselves in the crosshairs of military aggression by the CCP. Meanwhile, the CCP advances its Belt and Road Initiative to ensnare other countries into its debt trap diplomacy that only benefits the CCP. Further, the CCP engages in unfair trade practices and actively seeks to steal intellectual property from the United States and others.

We cannot afford to misread the CCP’s intentions. The Select Committee will make the urgent case for aiding Taiwan in its self-defense and build relationships with our other Indo-Pacific allies.

As China uses its growing economy to modernize its military, we must also develop new weapons and stockpiles to project power, preserve our global influence, and protect our forces, including in space and cyberspace.

Further, we will look at how the United States and freedom-loving countries can work together to push viable alternatives to the Belt and Road Initiative. The time-tested formula for victory—while deterring war— as President Reagan proved, is peace through strength.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER

In addition, winning the new Cold War with China requires defending our domestic institutions. The Select Committee will demonstrate how the CCP uses ""United Front Work"" and authoritarian tactics to cultivate foreign elites and silence criticism of CCP atrocities, as well as shed light on ongoing CCP interference and influence campaigns in a way the American public can easily understand.

The Select Committee will expose how the CCP uses lobbying at the local, state, and federal level to advance CCP dogma against our interests and provide recommendations for fixing our weak lobbying laws.

Finally, the Select Committee will investigate the CCP’s attempts at infiltrating our academic institutions and the rise and proliferation of Confucius Institutes in the United States as organs of the CCP, as well as how the CCP or affiliated entities purchases land in the United States to the detriment of our national and economic security.

We also will seek to shine a light on the CCP’s security services operating in the United States, especially how the CCP attempts to intimidate and spy on Chinese citizens and Americans here in the United States. In doing all this, the Select Committee will take care to distinguish between the Chinese people and the regime that oppresses them.

26,Pentagon releases U-2 photo of Chinese spy balloon in flight before it was shot down,"The Department of Defense has released of a photo of the Chinese spy balloon that was shot down earlier this month off the coast of South Carolina after it had traversed the country.

The photo, obtained by Fox News Digital, was taken Feb. 3 by one of the U-2 pilots. It shows a U.S. Air Force pilot looking down at the suspect Chinese surveillance balloon as it hovered over the central continental U.S.

The following day, an F-22 fighter jet fired a single A9X missile to bring down the balloon at 58,000 feet over the Atlantic Ocean.

The shootdown triggered three subsequent shootdowns of unidentified objects and forced the U.S. military to reevaluate its guidelines for monitoring and reacting to unknown aerial objects.

But debris from the three other objects that were shot down over Alaska, Canada's Yukon territory and in U.S. airspace over Lake Huron ""are lost,"" Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., told reporters on Tuesday.

""The remnants are in very difficult terrain with low temperatures,"" he said. ""They haven't been able to find them.""

Despite the recent sightings, Biden said there's no evidence that there has been a sudden increase in the number of objects in the sky.

""We're now just seeing more of them, partially because the steps we've taken to increase our radars, narrow our radars, and we have to keep adapting our approach to delay, to dealing with these challenges,"" he said.

Researchers at universities in the United Kingdom examined the Chinese version of the Android OS distributions run by Xiaomi, Realme and OnePlus headsets, experimenting with a number of devices.

The arXiv paper's authors measured the network traffic generated by handsets when in use, using static and dynamic code analysis techniques to look at the data transmitted by the reinstalled system apps.

""We find that these devices come bundled with a number of third-party applications, some of which are granted dangerous runtime permissions by default without user consent, and transmit traffic containing a broad range of geolocation, user-profile and social relationships [personally identifiable information] to both phone vendors and third-party domains, without notifying the user or offering the choice to opt-out,"" the research showed.

The packages transmitted to many third-party domains contain privacy-sensitive information related to devices, including GPS coordinates, network-related identifiers, phone numbers, app usage data and call histories.

SEN. JOHN KENNEDY: We got China in the World Trade Organization on December 11th, 2001. China started cheating December 12th. And for 20-plus years, we were all told by every president, be patient with China. They're developing. They'll eventually democratize and adopt Western values. Well, they didn't and it was only under President Trump, and we must give him credit for this, [he] said enough. I don't want a hot war with China. I don't want a cold war with China, but you people need to become responsible members of a stable world order. And that's all I want from them. But it doesn't help any of us to deny the fact that President Xi would steal the hair off your heads, OK? He is interested in one thing and one thing only: his power. And he has proven, and Putin has proven, that they each have a taste for blood. Putin has the taste for blood of Stalin. Xi has a taste for blood of Mao and that's just reality. These are hard men.

32,"China poses 'biggest long-term threat to economic and national security,' FBI Director Wray warns","FBI Director Christopher Wray on Wednesday said China poses the ""biggest long-term threat"" to the economic and national security of the United States and Western allies, and warned that Beijing is ""trying to shape the world"" by interfering in politics, business and more.

Wray’s warning comes just months after the Biden Justice Department, which oversees the FBI, ended the Trump-era ""China Initiative"" program aimed at preventing spying by the Chinese Communist Party. The Biden administration, instead, replaced it with a broader approach to counter ""nation-state threats.""

Wray, during a speech focused on ""common threats"" the U.S. and the United Kingdom face at the MI5 building in London Wednesday, said the FBI has ""no closer partner than MI5"" and the two agencies work together on ""almost every mission"" they confront, from ""countering terrorism to cybertheft and transnational repression to espionage.""

Wray pointed to the ""complex, enduring and pervasive danger"" that China poses to both nations, and other Western allies.

CHINA'S XI JINPING IS 'A SILENT PARTNER' IN PUTIN'S 'AGGRESSION' IN UKRAINE, CIA DIRECTOR BURNS WARNS

""We consistently see that it’s the Chinese government that poses the biggest long-term threat to our economic and national security, and by ‘our,’ I mean both of our nations, along with our allies in Europe and elsewhere,"" Wray said, adding that ""it is the Chinese government and the Chinese Community Party that pose the threat we’re focused on countering – not the Chinese people, and certainly not Chinese immigrants in our countries – who are themselves frequently victims of the Chinese government’s lawless aggression.""

Wray warned that the Chinese government ""poses an even more serious threat to Western businesses than even many sophisticated business people realize,"" and said the ""danger"" from China is ""complex and growing.""

""The Chinese government is set on stealing your technology – whatever it is that makes your industry tick – and using it to undercut your business, and dominate your market,"" Wray said. ""And they’re set on using every tool at their disposal to do it.""

Wray warned that Beijing uses intelligence officers to target valuable private sector information, multiplying their efforts by working extensively through scores of ""co-optees,"" people who aren’t technically Chinese government officials but assist in intelligence operations.

But it isn’t just large corporations China is keen on targeting. Wray said the CCP ""wants to target companies in big cities to small towns, from Fortune 100s to start-ups,"" specifically those in aviation, artificial intelligence and pharmaceuticals.

Wray said the FBI has ""even caught people affiliated with Chinese companies out in the U.S. heartland, sneaking into fields to dig up proprietary, genetically modified seeds, which would have cost them nearly a decade and billions in research to develop themselves.""

But Wray said those efforts ""pale in comparison to their lavishly resourced hacking program that’s bigger than that of every other major country – combined,"" warning that Beijing views cyber as ""the pathway to cheat and steal on a massive scale.""

Meanwhile, Wray also warned of China interfering in elections, pointing to one example in New York this spring.

""The Chinese government went so far as directly interfering in a congressional election in New York, because they did not want the candidate – a Tiananmen Square protester and critic of the Chinese government – to be elected.""

BIDEN ADMIN HAS 'DEEP CONCERNS' ABOUT CHINA'S 'ALIGNMENT' WITH RUSSIA AMID WAR AGAINST UKRAINE, OFFICIAL SAYS

Wray detailed their efforts, including the CCP hiring a private investigator to dig up derogatory info and derail the candidate's campaign.

""But when they couldn't find anything, they decided to manufacture a controversy using a sex worker, and when that didn't work out, they even suggested using violence, such as arranging for the candidate to be struck by a vehicle and making it look like an accident,"" Wray explained.

""The Chinese government is trying to shape the world by interfering in our politics, and those of our allies,"" Wray said. ""All of that is to say – China poses a far more complex and pervasive threat to businesses than even the most sophisticated company leaders realize.""

Wray encouraged business leaders to coordinate with the FBI and MI5 in order to protect themselves.

But Wray also warned that China is emboldened by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with regard to its ambitions to take Taiwan.

""When it comes to the threat against Taiwan… I’m confident in saying that China is drawing all sorts of lessons from what’s happening with Russia and its invasion of Ukraine,"" Wray said, noting that the FBI has seen China ""looking for ways to insulate their economy against potential sanctions"" to protect themselves from ""harm if they do anything to draw the ire of the international community.""

""In our world, we call that kind of behavior a clue,"" Wray said.

Wray warned that ""if China does invade Taiwan,"" Western allies could see ""supply chains and relationships disrupted.""

But Wray said the U.S. and the U.K., together are ""confronting this threat and winning important battles.""

""All of us in America, in the U.K., and across the free world, are in this together,"" Wray said. ""And together, we’re an awfully formidable team.""

CIA FORMING MISSION TO COUNTER CHINA, 'THE MOST IMPORTANT GEOPOLITICAL THREAT WE FACE'

As for Taiwan, in March, the intelligence community annual threat assessment was released with data through January. It warned that China is increasingly a ""near-peer competitor, challenging the United States in multiple arenas – especially economically, militarily and technologically – and is pushing to change global norms and potentially threatening its neighbors.""

The intelligence community warned that Beijing is using a coordinated approach to compel neighbors to ""acquiesce"" to its preferences, ""including its territorial and maritime claims and assertions of sovereignty over Taiwan.""

""Beijing will press Taiwan to move toward unification and will react to what it views as increased U.S.–Taiwan engagement,"" the IC states. ""We expect that friction will grow as China continues to increase military activity around the island and Taiwan’s leaders resist Beijing’s pressure for progress toward unification.""

In April, CIA Director William Burns issued a similar warning to Wray’s – also noting that China has been ""a silent partner"" in Russian President Vladimir Putin’s aggression in Ukraine.

Burns, at the time, said China is ""in many ways, the most profound tests the CIA has ever faced,"" calling China a ""formidable competitor lacking in neither ambition nor capability.""

Meanwhile, as for the DOJ’s move to abolish the Trump-era ""China Initiative,"" Justice Department officials were concerned that the program stoked anti-Asian bias after receiving input from the Asian American community.

The DOJ replaced the program with the ""Strategy for Countering Nation-State Threats,"" saying the ""current threat landscape"" demanded ""a broader approach,"" and cited not just China, but Iran, Russia and North Korea.

""These nations seek to undermine our core democratic, economic and scientific institutions,"" Assistant Attorney General Matthew Olsen of the DOJ's National Security Division said in March. ""And they employ a growing range of tactics to advance their interests and to harm the United States. Defending American institutions and values against these threats is a national security imperative and a priority for the Department.""

LiAngelo Ball, brother of Los Angeles Lakers’ star point guard Lonzo Ball and son of the outspoken LaVar Ball, was one of three UCLA freshman basketball players arrested on Tuesday after allegedly stealing from a Louis Vuitton store in Hangzhou, China.

The players were in the city of Hangzhou preparing for their season-opener in Shanghai. It is unclear what the players allegedly stole. Louis Vuitton is world famous for its high-end bags and accessories.

Ball was arrested with teammates Cody Riley and Jalen Hill. They are being questioned by police for allegedly shoplifting from the store next to their hotel, according to ESPN. The players did not travel with the team on Wednesday, the report said.

Shoplifting in China can carry a prison sentence between three and 10 years in prison. It and could take prosecutors over a month to decide whether to press charges, reported Yahoo.

If that is the case, the three student athletes are in jeopardy of missing a handful of games regardless of whether they are indicted.

“We are aware of a situation involving UCLA student-athletes in Hangzhou, China. The University is cooperating fully with local authorities on this matter, and we have no further comment at this time,” UCLA said in a statement.

40,China experts predict Beijing’s next move after spy balloon shot down,"FIRST ON FOX: Several China experts gave their predictions on what Beijing’s next move will be after the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) spy balloon was shot down Saturday .

The massive spy balloon made its way for several days across the U.S. before being blown up this weekend off the coast of South Carolina.

Former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for East Asia Heino Klinck told Fox News Digital in a Saturday phone interview that the CCP will ""accuse the United States of being provocative and taking kinetic action to remove this Chinese aircraft from American airspace.""

REPUBLICANS RIP BIDEN AFTER CHINESE SPY BALLOON SHOT DOWN: ‘OUR ENEMIES USED TO FEAR US’

""They'll claim that it was all completely innocent. That it was a weather balloon. They'll reiterate the statements they've made before,"" Klinck said. ""But in essence, as is the norm for them, they'll launch counteraccusations and deny that they were in the wrong.""

Klinck said that, while he does not believe China will take a physically aggressive stance, they may be rhetorically aggressive as they try to shift the blame away from them.

""Rhetorically, it may be aggressive, but they're not going to take physical action. Again, it's their norm to try to shift blame,"" Klinck said.

""It is the norm for them to try to portray themselves as the innocent actor abiding by international law and international standards of conduct, when in fact it's the exact opposite,"" he continued.

The former Beijing-based U.S. official said he thinks ""what will be interesting to see is how the Chinese position themselves vis-a-vis Taiwan,"" and that he could foresee China ""becoming even more aggressive in terms of playing incursions into Taiwanese airspace.""

While Klinck said he is not a proponent of putting specific years on Chinese plans, he believes ""that what's paramount is that the United States, its partners and allies and like-minded nations are prepared to, if necessary, confront the Chinese today.""

""So I don't think we can put off our preparations until 2025 or 2027 or 2049,"" Klinck said. ""We need to be ready today.""

American Enterprise Institute (AEI) China senior fellow Zack Cooper told Fox News Digital he does ""not expect Beijing to retaliate after the balloon was shot down.""

""I think Chinese leaders will want to put this affair behind them, so at most I would expect a short public statement followed by an effort to reschedule the Blinken meeting,"" Cooper said.

""I don’t think this fundamentally changes the two sides’ leverage vis-a-vis one another,"" Cooper continued. ""But it could be hard to reschedule the visit in the near term given Blinken’s busy schedule and the upcoming NPC meeting.""

Saturday saw the Chinese spy balloon that flew over the U.S. for several days shot down by the U.S. military.

Former Trump administration Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Dr. James Anderson told Fox News Digital that ""China will continue to claim that the United States ‘overreacted’ in shooting down the spy balloon. ""

""This is an effort by the Chinese to deflect attention from the fact that they egregiously and provocatively violated U.S. airspace and international law,"" Anderson said. ""Beijing may also engage in further provocations against U.S. interests in the days ahead. Washington needs to be vigilant and prepared to vigorously defend its national security interests both at home and abroad.""

""It is possible, though one would certainly hope unlikely, that in the coming days one or more PLA-directed maritime vessels may seek to interfere with the recovery effort of the balloon debris located within U.S. territorial waters,"" he continued. ""If this were to happen, U.S. warships would be fully justified in providing any such intruders with one-way tickets to the bottom of the ocean.""

Several Republicans in both chambers of Congress torched President Biden after the balloon was shot down, with many taking aim at the president’s sluggish timeline to take down the CCP spyware.

The downing came after public outcry about the balloon, which hovered over several states.

Texas Republican Rep. Pete Sessions said he believes ""it’s very clear that, because commonsense Americans were overwhelmingly disgusted with not only the administration's responses to questions, they were horrified that we have a president who would allow Chinese spyware to be on top of our country for days at a time and seemingly to do nothing.""

""So I applaud the American people, normal American citizens who expressed outrage,"" Sessions told Fox News Digital in an exclusive Saturday phone interview. ""That is why this happened.""",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/china-experts-predict-beijings-next-move-after-spy-balloon-shot-down,N/A
41,"China drought, scorching temperatures causing blackouts and factory closures","A massive drought, coupled with record high temperatures, is wreaking havoc on China’s economy, causing the country to shut down factories and endure rolling blackouts.

China’s Sichuan Province, one of the most populous and fastest growing industrial centers in the country, has been stricken by a severe drought that has meant little rain to power hydroelectric dams that typically generate three-quarters of the area’s electricity that is sent to cities as far as Shanghai, The New York Times reported this week.

The lack of rain, which is being exacerbated by scorching temperatures exceeding 100 degrees Fahrenheit, has left rivers with unusually low water levels. This shortage has prevented the dams from providing enough electricity to support the Sichuan Province. As a result, factories in the area have been forced to close, sometimes for a week at a time.

In addition to shutting down factories, the power shortage has also caused rolling blackouts in some areas downstream from the Sichuan Province in places like the city of Chongqing and adjacent Hubei Province.

""Part of the issue here is that China has a broader water shortage,"" Dean Cheng, senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation's Asian Studies Center, told Fox News Digital. ""Entire river systems in China have gone dry. The Chinese are redirecting rivers from the south to the northern plains of China which includes Beijing because the rivers up there are running dry.""

Rainfall in the Yangtze basin has been around 45% lower than normal since July, and high temperatures are likely to persist for at least another week, official forecasts said.

As many as 66 rivers across 34 counties in Chongqing have dried up, state broadcaster CCTV said on Friday.

""For the Yangtze,"" Cheng said, ""part of the problem is that the river goes all the way out to the sea near Shanghai. When the river levels are falling you start affecting the draft of the vessels that can go up and down. If you start requiring the ships to operate at less than full load, you also start affecting their ability to move stuff out of the country in terms of products and also moving into the upstream to the internal supply chains.""

Cheng explained that the energy crunch and supply chain issues have been further exacerbated by China's continued support for coronavirus lockdowns, which have crippled the economy even further.

China's central bank announced on Monday that it would cut its five-year interest rate by .15 percentage points and lower the mortgage reference by a bigger margin as Beijing boosts efforts to revive the economy.

China's economy, the world's second biggest, narrowly avoided contracting in the second quarter and a raft of data released last week showed that the economy unexpectedly slowed in July, prompting some global investment banks, including Goldman Sachs and Nomura, to revise down their full-year GDP growth forecasts for China.

The Associated Press reported that the announcement was made by the National Health Commission as the latest effort to ease China’s measures to control COVID-19.

Under current conditions, all inbound passengers are required to quarantine at a hotel for five days, then another three days once they get home.

Still, anyone visiting China from afar must have a negative virus test 48 hours before departing and wear a mask while on board their flight, a post from the Chinese health commission stated.

China's National Health Commission said last month that people with asymptomatic COVID-19 cases and those with mild symptoms may now isolate at home instead of being forced into a state-run quarantine facility. Additionally, authorities loosened testing requirements and travel restrictions within the country, according to a 10-point plan released by the health authority.

As of Dec. 23, the number of people getting vaccinated daily had risen to 3.5 million across the nation, the National Health Commission announced. In early 2021, though, there were tens of millions of shots being given each day for the flu.

43,"If China conquers Taiwan, it would be huge blow to US national security, economy","NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

Imagine deterrence fails and China successfully takes Taiwan. How would it affect the U.S. economy and inform whether the U.S. should fight China for Taiwan’s freedom?

Losing Taiwan would be an unrecoverable blow to America’s strength and influence. An absorption of Taiwan’s GDP into China would give it enhanced market power. Taiwan’s centrality to the sea’s busiest lanes of international commerce would give China an even greater launching pad to dominate Asia. Would China abuse its economic superiority and new position atop the strategic crossways of Asia? Its current economic behavior suggests it would.

First, the Chinese are already flagrant violators of trading rules. A Taiwan takeover would give Beijing increased leverage over its regional trading partners and would afford China more opportunity to bend or break rules to its benefit. Already the U.S. has shelved its trade ambitions in Asia by abandoning the Trans-Pacific Partnership. A takeover of Taiwan further cedes the field to the Chinese alternative, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). China could use RCEP to further set the rules of global trade and deepen its economic relationships in Asia at the expense of the U.S.

US TO SEND B-52 BOMBERS TO AUSTRALIA IN MOVE CHINA WARNS COULD 'TRIGGER' ARMS RACE

Second, a Taiwan takeover would afford the Chinese opportunities for hostile economic activity like preventing or taxing ships in ""its waters."" Would China abuse its new position? China is certainly capable of such brazenness. Just consider the Chinese ""land grab"" in the South China Sea. Through a campaign of militarization and coercion over the last decade, China has built massive artificial island bases and actively sought control over virtually all the waters, seabed, and airspace of the South China Sea. Also, in April 2020, a China Coast Guard vessel rammed and sank a Vietnamese fishing boat. Taiwan would give China a new platform to engage in gray zone activities to bully its neighbors for economic benefit.

Third, a Chinese takeover would put Asia-centric supply chains at the mercy of the Chinese. Take for example the disruptions due to COVID-19. Thousands of unfinished cars and trucks sit idle awaiting Taiwan’s chips which are also critical to smartphones, computers and home appliances. Some reports indicate this cost the U.S. economy $240 million. But this could be modest when compared to China’s new leverage over Taiwan’s semiconductor manufacturing.

Taiwan makes 65% of the world’s semiconductors and almost 90% of advanced chips. One study estimates a one-year loss of $490 billion in global electronics companies in the event of a yearlong disruption. Chinese control of Taiwan’s semiconductor capacity is an unacceptably high risk to the U.S. economy when considering that Taiwan accounts for roughly 70% of the world’s microchip supply.

Finally, we can expect a China augmented by Taiwan’s market power to exert economic coercion on its neighbors, many of whom are our allies. Just take the example of their relations with Australia. China made 14 infamous demands, among them, that Australia cease faulting China on human rights and other ""internal matters."" As leverage, China cut off some market access with astronomical tariffs on barley, beef, and wine. Relations between Australia and China went into a near-freeze for two years and are only recently normalizing. China is already the leading trade partner of roughly 130 countries many of whom could conclude that they cannot afford to cross China.

A Chinese takeover of Taiwan is an unacceptably high risk for the U.S. economy. But would the U.S. fight for Taiwan? For deterrence to work, China must believe the American people would lend their support.

President Joe Biden, on numerous occasions, has suggested we would fight for Taiwan, but his staff confuses the issue by insisting that the U.S. policy has not changed. Although the American distrust of China explains support for Taiwan generally, that’s a far cry from public support for fighting China for Taiwan’s freedom.

The potential economic harm from a Chinese Taiwan takeover is very serious and the president and members of Congress should explain the stakes to the American people. Public support is fundamental to deterrence and without it, China could reasonably conclude that the American people would never fight a war over a faraway island thousands of miles away.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/if-china-conquers-taiwan-would-huge-blow-us-national-security-economy,N/A
44,China grapples massive COVID wave with full emergency wards and crowded crematoriums: 'Many people dying',"China’s ongoing battle with a COVID surge has completely devastated the country’s healthcare infrastructure, especially in the Hebei province.

Hospitals in Baoding and Langfang have been forced to turn away ambulances and ill patients seeking treatment, while health administrators have been required to treat patients in over-capacity intensive care units on benches or the floor, officials said.

""I don’t have much hope,"" said Yao Ruyan, whose elderly mother-in-law requires urgent medical care as she contracted the coronavirus. However, Yao has been unable to find a hospital with room to treat her, the Associated Press reported.

Yao and her husband said they have been met with the same response at each hospital: there is no room for another patient. After the family drove to Zhuozhou Hospital, which is an hour’s drive from Yao’s hometown, the response was the same.

""I’m furious,"" a tearful Yao added. ""We’ve been out for a long time and I’m terrified because she’s having difficulty breathing.""

And the problem exists for more than just Yao.

An ICU at Baoding No. 2 Hospital in Zhuozhou was so crowded that a medical worker instructed people wheeling in a patient from an arriving ambulance to seek care elsewhere.

""There’s been so many people dying,"" said Zhao Yongsheng, a funeral worker. ""They work day and night, but they can’t burn them all.""

CHINA'S COVID-19 SURGE: LEADERS PLOT ECONOMIC RECOVERY AS CASES SPIKE DUE TO POLICY ROLLBACK AFTER PROTESTS

The Chinese government has reported only seven COVID-19 deaths since it loosened restrictions on Dec. 7, but absent a solution to provide quick and adequate care, China’s forecast in its battle with COVID looks grim.

China’s officially reported death toll for COVID since the global outbreak began in the final months of 2019, is a mere 5,241. For context, the official death toll in the United States is over 1.1 million.

Modeling suggests large numbers of people will continue getting infected and dying throughout Beijing and the rest of China.

46,China could invade Taiwan before the 2024 US presidential election: sources,"EXCLUSIVE: China could invade Taiwan within the next 18 months, current and former officials familiar with U.S. and allied intelligence told Fox News, suggesting a particularly ""dangerous"" window between the meeting of the National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party this November and the next U.S. presidential election in 2024.

Two former senior officials told Fox News that the intelligence suggests China sees the potential opportunity for an amphibious assault and military invasion of Taiwan in that time frame.

""We have always had and always been aware that China has an ever-present, ever-evolving plan for an amphibious assault and military invasion of Taiwan. If they are not successful in reunifying politically, then they will do so with force,"" one former senior intelligence official familiar with U.S. intelligence, and who has discussed intelligence belonging to a U.S. ally in the Indo-Pacific, told Fox News.

""What is different now is, we have intelligence that this has gone from an indefinite, nebulous scenario, to a belief that there is a window of opportunity in the next 18 months,"" the official continued. ""I don’t think that’s a coincidence that window of opportunity is within a Biden administration.""

WHITE HOUSE: US 'DOES NOT WANT A CRISIS' BUT WILL 'MANAGE WHAT BEIJING CHOOSES TO DO' AMID PELOSI TAIWAN VISIT

A former senior Trump administration official told Fox News House Speaker Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan is being used as a ""pretext"" for increased Chinese aggression around Taiwan, but said it is ""not the real cause of it,"" and warned that the ""Davidson Window"" is ""closing.""

Former commander of American forces in the Indo-Pacific Adm. Philip Davison testified last year that China could invade Taiwan within the next six years—by 2027.

""The window is now between the Party Congress and the next U.S. presidential election,"" the official said noting that window could close by January 2025—at the end of the presidential transition period. ""I think we are in a very dangerous two-year window right now.""

The 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party is expected to take place in November, where Chinese President Xi Jinping is expected to be re-elected.

A spokesperson for the White House National Security Council told Fox News that the United States ""will not seek and does not want a crisis.""

""We are prepared to manage what Beijing chooses to do. We will not engage in saber-rattling, and we're not looking to escalate,"" the NSC spokesperson told Fox News. ""At the same time, we're going to be steady and resolute. We will not be deterred from operating in the seas and skies of the Western Pacific as we have done for decades.""

The spokesperson added that the United States ""will continue to support Taiwan, consistent with our commitments under the Taiwan Relations Act, and defend a free and open Indo-Pacific.""

""We're communicating closely with our allies and partners. And we are maintaining open lines of communication Beijing,"" the spokesperson said. ""We will keep doing what we are doing -- supporting cross-Strait peace and stability.""

However, the former senior Trump administration official told Fox News that ""the likelihood of invasion has increased dramatically with China perceiving the United States is in a weakened position,"" pointing to the Biden administration’s ""surrender"" of Afghanistan to the Taliban in August 2021 and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which resulted ""in only half-measure sanctions being put on the Russian Federation.""

PENTAGON OFFICIAL SAYS 'ONLY A MATTER OF TIME' BEFORE CHINA CAUSES 'MAJOR' INCIDENT IN INDO-PACIFIC REGION

The official also said Xi has been emboldened by U.S. ""domestic problems,"" including crime in cities across the nation, ""the lack of control"" at the Southern border, and the ""failures"" of the Biden administration’s energy policy.

The official stressed that the invasion could happen before the inauguration of the next president in 2025, saying China fears the election of ""another leader that could return to a more robust, ‘peace through strength’ foreign policy and stronger domestic policies.""

With regard to criticisms of the current administration's foreign policy and its withdrawal from Afghanistan, a Biden administration official told Fox News that China ""would love nothing more than for the U.S. government to still be bogged down in a 20-year war, still committing billions of dollars, U.S. troops, and have our military focused on another country's civil war.

""By being able to withdraw our forces from Afghanistan, we have been able to reposition them and refocus our efforts to other areas of the world,"" the official said. The official added that the Biden administration ""freed up resources"" and said leaving Afghanistan put the United States ""in a much better position on the geopolitical stage when it comes to our strategic competition with China or with any other important issues around the world.""

However, during an interview with Fox News Wednesday, Former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for East Asia Heino Klinck said the United States ""has failed to deter adversaries within the last 18 months.""

""If anything, the United States has been deterred from forcefully supporting its partners and allies worldwide,"" Klinck said, adding that he has viewed 2024 as a ""particularly dangerous year.""

""The reason is because it is not only the election in the United States, but it is also the presidential election in Taiwan,"" Klinck said, stressing that he believes the People’s Liberation Army ""will move against Taiwan when the Chinese Communist Party tells it to, regardless of timing.""

""I view 2024 as being dangerous because I believe the CCP, particularly President Xi Jinping, will see it as a potential window of opportunity because of the U.S. election, and the fact that he probably perceives that the United States is going to shy away from an international crisis during a presidential election,"" he told Fox News.

Klinck, who also formerly served as a U.S. military attaché at the U.S. embassy in Beijing, currently serves as a senior advisor to the National Bureau of Asian Research.

""I also believe he perceives that the presumptive next Taiwanese president is going to move Taiwan closer to independence,"" he said.

CHINA POSES 'BIGGEST LONG-TERM THREAT TO ECONOMIC AND NATIONAL SECURITY,' FBI DIRECTOR WRAY WARNS

Current Biden administration officials told Fox News that the situation is fluid and that they are monitoring closely as China gears up for ""potential escalation."" Officials said they are looking to see how the situation will play out over the coming months and how far China will go.

Officials say they are focusing on what the heightened threat could mean for Taiwan, for U.S.-Chinese relations, and for certain critical industries that could be impacted.

White House National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications John Kirby said Tuesday that even before Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan this week, Beijing ""positioned itself to take further steps, and we expect that they will continue to react over a longer-term horizon.""

At this point, the Chinese have declared several closure areas around Taiwan for military exercises, and Klinck told Fox News that some of those closure areas ""encroach upon Taiwanese territorial waters.""

Klinck told Fox News that this is the first time the military exercises are taking place east of Taiwan.

MILLEY DIRECTS A REVIEW OF US, CHINESE MILITARY CONTACTS, AMID WARNING BEIJING POSES NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT

""The Chinese are trying to say to Taiwan, you don’t have any territorial waters because you belong to us, and they are going to make the point now by conducting exercises there, and they have never done that before,"" Klinck said. ""They have previously declared closure areas and conducted exercises there. They have never done it though on the east side of Taiwan.""

Biden administration officials have been warning for months of increased Chinese aggression, with one top Pentagon official last month sounding the alarm that it is ""only a matter of time"" before a ""major incident or accident"" occurs in the Indo-Pacific.

Assistant Secretary for Defense for Indo-Pacific Security Affairs Ely Ratner said last month that the Pentagon has witnessed a ""sharp increase"" in aggressive behavior by the PLA in the Indo-Pacific, admitting that it has ""increased dramatically, with dozens of dangerous events in the first half of this year alone.""

The warnings from the Pentagon come just days after Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley directed his staff to collect information on interactions between the U.S. and Chinese militaries in the last five years.

""If you were to rank them, I would put Taiwan first, South China Sea second, the Senkaku Islands third and then elsewhere in the world,"" James Anderson, the acting Under Secretary of Defense for Policy during the Trump Administration, said, adding that the Sea of Japan could also serve as the flashpoint for conflict with China.

UN HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL WEIGHS ACCUSING CHINA OF ‘CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY’

Proximity to China would provide Beijing a significant advantage, similar to how Russia saw a swing in momentum during its Ukraine invasion once it shortened its supply lines to focus only on the territories just beyond its western border in the Donbas region.

PUTIN, XI TO MEET FACE TO FACE NEXT WEEK IN FIRST MEETING SINCE WAR IN UKRAINE

""The problem is that in the Indo-Pacific Theater, the closer you get to China, the more [China] can concentrate its military assets,"" Anderson explained. ""What is especially concerning to the United States and its allies are ballistic missiles and the fact that China is probably ahead of us with hypersonic weaponry,"" which could allow China to hit jet carriers and other surface ships hard and fast.

Even with that advantage though, China faces a significant conflict that Dr. John Lee, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute and former Senior National Security Advisor to Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, said would prove ""a very bloody affair for both sides.""

""Over the past two decades, the U.S. and allies have been very passive, allowing the People’s Liberation Army to achieve air and sea dominance in this theater,"" Lee said. ""However, [they] are now becoming serious about developing long-range strike capabilities, hypersonic strike capabilities, asymmetrical capabilities … and the range of non-military measures which would include crippling economic and financial sanctions.""

""In short, the U.S. and allies have many good and powerful options to ensure the military and strategic balance is in their favor,"" he added.

SENATE COMMITTEE TO MEET THIS WEEK OVER BIPARTISAN TAIWAN DEFENSE BILL

Anderson also touted the U.S. military’s ability to counter missiles. However, that capability loses impact in the face of ""saturation attacks,"" which effectively aim to blanket a target with missiles and stretch defensive efforts.

The U.S. has, therefore, also focused on trying to strengthen Taiwan through the ""porcupine strategy,"" which would see nations supply the island nation with a large amount of anti-tank and anti-air weaponry to help close the gap in military superiority that China holds.

China holds a manpower advantage over the U.S., with China’s 2.8 million soldier army outranking the U.S. alone, according to Brookings Institution, but a naval and air combat operation would severely limit that advantage.

""At this stage, China has air and sea dominance over the Taiwan Strait but cannot land troops successfully on Taiwan,"" Lee said. ""If it achieves the capacity to do so, then China will see the military option as a more attractive one.""

Matt McInnis, of the Institute for the Study of War, noted that China’s goal will largely dictate its coordination and deployment: Any attempt to secure islands in the contested seas and straits would likely choke point the Chinese forces, leaving limited use for troop deployments.

""Depending on your objectives and what they aim to achieve through naval and air forces, you would potentially have some use for Marines to hold certain smaller pieces of territory and some smaller islands,"" McInnis said, adding that Beijing would only proceed with an invasion once it felt reasonably confident American forces could not deploy quickly enough to the region.

Anderson noted that China has closed the gap in other military domains, but has not yet overtaken the U.S., acknowledging that China has ""the largest number of ships in the world today,"" but that the U.S. still has the advantage in terms of quality, and the same holds true for a ""superior"" U.S. Air Force.

The U.S. also can rely on regional partners. China, on the other hand, has few allies to turn to, largely looking toward countries like Russia to help it ""deflect"" economic pressure that the U.S. and its allies, according to McInnis.

""There will certainly be economic lines of effort … and I'm quite sure China is looking long-term at how Russia, as well as key energy suppliers like Iran, can help them manage economic fallout from a conflict with the United States,"" he said. ""But I don't think we're at the point in the relationship between countries, certainly including North Korea, where they would necessarily provide operational support or lethal aid directly to China.""

Lee believes that China’s position weakened since it tipped its hand and revealed ""broader intentions"" to ""dominate East Asia,"" a move that also has emboldened the U.S. and its allies to ensure they counter China’s ambitions.

""China seeks to prevail by convincing the US and allies that it is not ‘worth it’ to defend Taiwan, that the cost would be too great,"" he said.

48,China says it will work with Russia to create new international order,"A top Chinese official said that his country will continue its partnership with Russia in the hopes of creating a new international order that will rival western influence.

""The Chinese side is willing to work with the Russian side to continuously implement high-level strategic cooperation between the two countries, safeguard common interests and promote the development of the international order in a more just and reasonable direction,"" Director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the Communist Party of China Central Committe Yang Jiechi said Monday, according to Bloomberg.

The comments come amid Russia's ongoing war with neighboring Ukraine, which has resulted in international outrage and an effort by many western governments to sanction Russia and cut off its influence around the globe.

But the international influence campaign has seemingly brought Russia and China closer together, with Chinese President Xi Jinping set to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin later this week in Xi's first foreign trip since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

RUSSIANS SET UP METHOD TO CONVERT WIRE CURRENCY INTO CHINESE YUAN, SPARKING FEARS OF ALLIANCE

While China has not provided Russia with direct support or relief from sanctions, it has extended its trade partnership with a Russian economy struggling to find international partners. About 81% of Russian car imports during the second quarter came from China, Bloomberg reported, while China's Xiaomi phone brand became the most popular in Russia during the same time period.

China has also been a dependable consumer of Russian fuel, buying up liquefied natural gas (LNG) at a steep discount from Russia. The arrangement has benefited both countries, giving Russia a buyer for its energy resources while China has used the windfall to sell energy sources at a markup to a European economy that has found itself short of resources amid sanctions against Russia.

""Russia and China are building a massive $55 billion pipeline called the ‘Power of Siberia,’ delivering gas from Siberia to Shanghai,"" Rebekah Koffler, a former DIA intelligence officer and the author of ""Putin’s Playbook: Russia’s Secret Plan to Defeat America,"" told Fox News Digital. ""This is a major development of strategic importance as Putin is pivoting to Asia in a big way. The Kremlin has concluded that Russia-U.S. relations are irreparable and that the U.S. and Western sanctions are here to stay indefinitely.""

Russia and China have also worked together to send money transfers to China in yuan without using the SWIFT messaging system, which helps Russia bypass international sanctions and works toward the Chinese goal of devaluing the influence of the U.S. dollar.

49,"China mocks Biden for knocking down balloons with fighter jets: ‘Hysterical,’ ‘laughably juvenile’","News outlets owned by the Chinese Communist Party say President Biden has only managed to make the U.S. military look weaker by pitting fighter jets against a surveillance balloon and an unknown ""object,"" and cast China as the responsible party in the relationship while blaming the U.S. for holding a ""hysterical"" position on China.

""The Joe Biden administration's handling of the Chinese balloon case last week was meant to showcase the United States' strategic strength amid fierce attacks by Republicans and the low approval ratings of U.S. official,"" said an op-ed that appeared in China Daily, the country’s largest news outlet. ""But instead it has shown to the world how immature and irresponsible — indeed hysterical — the U.S. has been in dealing with the case.""

That op-ed, which also appeared in the People’s Daily — another state-owned media source — said Biden’s unpopularity in the U.S. and pressure from Republicans to get tough on China is what prompted Biden to ""overreact"" to the balloon incident.

DEMS JOIN GOP IN VOTE TO CONDEMN CHINA'S SURVEILLANCE FLIGHT, DEMAND MORE INFO FROM BIDEN

""The U.S. should have dealt with the balloon case in a calm and responsible way without letting it being hijacked by the bitter domestic partisan politics because a conflict between the two countries would spell disaster for the entire world,"" the op-ed said.

That op-ed appeared on the same day that the U.S. shot down a so-far unidentified object, which prompted Chinese hardline publication Global Times to accuse Biden of staging a ""juvenile farce"" in the skies in order to look tough on China.

""Less than a week after a U.S. fighter jet fired a missile and brought down a Chinese balloon, an utterly harmless civilian airship designed for meteorological use, the US shot down an unidentified object around Alaska on Friday at the order of President Joe Biden,"" an op-ed in that paper said. ""Stuck in typical partisanship and ‘political correctness,’ orders from the White House are getting laughably juvenile.""

CHINA ACCUSES THE US OF LYING TO THE WORLD ABOUT SPY SURVEILLANCE AIRCRAFT

The Global Times column said it seems clear that Biden shot down the second object quickly after being criticized for taking its time with the first object. It also accused the administration of trying to make the U.S. military look formidable by taking on what China insists are civilian airships.

""The U.S. did make a strong case that the F-22 is invincible, when its enemy are balloons,"" it said. ""Unfortunately, this is the way the US propagandizes – bragging about shooting down balloons.""

""Is US strong or weak? It looks pretty damn tough in the face of balloons, civilian airships, and other innocuous objects. But in the face of real battlefield, U.S.' choice is to exhaust others,"" it added, in an apparent reference to America's support for Ukraine in its defense against Russia.

Despite China’s effort to focus on partisan fighting within the U.S., Republicans and Democrats in the House voted unanimously this week to condemn China for sending at least one and possibly other balloons and other vessels into U.S. airspace.

CHINA CLAIMS CONGRESS 'DRAMATIZING' SPY FLIGHTS WITH BIPARTISAN RESOLUTION

Both parties have said it is China that is provoking the U.S., not the other way around, and have said together that China's word is not to be trusted.

This week, Democrats also had harsh words for China for trying to downplay its routine intrusion into U.S. airspace.

""China says it reserves the right to retaliate against America for the temerity of shooting down their spy balloon over our territory,"" said Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Calif.

50,"China ramps up surveillance, security threat with new satellite support from Antarctica","China earlier this month said it would develop new ground stations in Antarctica to support its satellite activity and data collection as concerns mount over Beijing’s surveillance programs and the rising security threats directed at the U.S.

A subsidiary of the state-owned China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation (CASIC), China Space News, said the defense contractor won a bid of 43.95 million yuan ($6.52 million) to construct an ocean observation satellite ground system.

The looming boost to China’s satellite capabilities prompted immediate concern about Beijing’s surveillance programs and how expanding their data collecting abilities could be enhanced by this Antarctic development.

But the new facilities to be developed on the existing Zhongshan research base in eastern Antarctica has one expert concerned for other reasons.

CHINA’S CAPABILITIES POSE POTENTIAL THREAT TO AMERICAN SPACE ASSETS, US MILITARY GENERAL SAYS

Rick Fisher, senior fellow with the International Assessment and Strategy Center, told Fox News Digital there has been concerning activity on the Zhongshan base for years.

The Chinese base, opened in 1989, was built for research relating to marine, glaciological, geological and atmospheric sciences. But, by 2021, under the guise of civilian research, China reportedly began employing advanced military capabilities, according to the Chinese military expert.

""In 2021, state media revealed that China had put a LIDAR — a laser radar — into the Zhongshan station to conduct ‘atmospheric research,'"" Fisher told Fox News Digital. ""Any kind of laser raises the possibility that the LIDAR could be upgraded to be a far more powerful laser.""

Fisher explained that the use of a more powerful laser from the Zhongshan base will enable China to damage or destroy targeted satellites.

The technology used to damage a satellite could also break away pieces of the device and increase the amount of debris in low Earth orbit that could further impair existing satellites.

The Zhongshan research base was built in line with the international 1959 Antarctic Treaty that says the world’s most southern continent will be used strictly for peaceful scientific research and bars any military maneuvering, an agreement that China, along with 51 other nations, have signed on to.

The U.S. and its military have been supporting research missions in the Antarctic for nearly seven decades, but Fisher says there is one major difference.

""The United States, Germany, Norway, perhaps other countries also had space probe facilities in Antarctica. However, none of them are developing Fractional Orbital Bombardment Systems (FOBS), as is China,"" he said.

FOBS date back to a Cold War-era missile program that looked to circumvent early U.S. warning detection systems by launching a nuclear warhead from the south over South America instead of from the west over Russia.

US CRANE SHIP RETRIEVES HUGE SECTION OF CHINESE SPY CRAFT FROM ATLANTIC

According to Fisher, the program was made obsolete with the development of deep space early warning detectors, but the expert warned China has revived this technology and tested its FOBS capabilities twice in 2021.

""If you're going to be attacking the United States in that manner — traversing Antarctica — it is extremely useful to have the ability to update a FOBS bus,"" he said, referring to the technology that would launch either a nuclear warhead or hypersonic missile.

This would ensure ""that the bus that would launch these weapons has the most accurate targeting updates and can achieve the highest accuracy in striking targets in the United States,"" Fisher added.

Few details were released on the new ground stations set to be developed at China’s Antarctic base, but Beijing’s military influence over its space program has prompted widespread concern regarding its space ambitions.

""Zhongshan base is becoming … a surveillance location from which to be able to better target American satellites. It’s a base that will … be able to guide new Chinese space weapons to American targets,"" Fisher said.

""These operations eschew official bilateral police and judicial cooperation and violate the international rule of law, and may violate the territorial integrity in third countries involved in setting up a parallel policing mechanism using illegal methods,"" reads a report by Safeguard Defenders, a human rights watchdog, released earlier this month.

The report, titled ""110 Overseas: Chinese Transnational Policing Gone Wild,"" details China's extensive efforts to combat ""fraud"" by its citizens living overseas, in part by opening several police stations on five continents that have assisted Chinese authorities in ""carrying out policing operations on foreign soil.""

VP KAMALA HARRIS EXPRESSES SUPPORT FOR TAIWAN, TORCHES CHINA WHILE ADDRESSING NAVY SAILORS IN JAPAN

Europe is home to most of the police stations, with locations spread across the continent in places such as London, Amsterdam, Prague, Budapest, Athens, Paris, Madrid and Frankfurt. North America is also home to four of the stations, with three locations in Toronto and one in New York City. In all, there are 54 such stations in 30 different countries.

The report details how China has attempted to ""combat the growing issue of fraud and telecommunication fraud by Chinese nationals living abroad,"" running operations that have resulted in 230,000 Chinese nationals being ""persuaded to return"" to China ""voluntarily"" over the last year to face criminal prosecution.

The Chinese government has claimed that the stations provide vital services to its citizens living abroad, though the report notes that many of the services are those that would be traditionally carried out by an overseas embassy. Instead, the report argues that the stations have been used to enhance China's overseas law enforcement capabilities in possible violation of international law.

The report also outlines the potential human rights abuses associated with the stations, including using harassment and intimidation methods, such as threatening the family members of the overseas citizens. The stations have also served as centers to spread Chinese government propaganda and monitor the behavior and opinions of Chinese nationals.

""As these operations continue to develop, and new mechanisms are set up, it is evident that countries governed by the standards set by universal human rights and the rule of law urgently need to investigate these practices to identify the (local) actors at work, mitigate the risks and effectively protect the growing number of those targeted,"" the report concludes.",https://www.foxnews.com/world/china-opened-overseas-police-stations-us-canada-monitor-chinese-citizens,N/A

In an article in Xinhua, the state-run media agency that's largely considered the mouthpiece of the party, Beijing bragged about its handling of COVID-19, a virus that originated in the city of Wuhan and has spread quickly around the world, killing nearly 5,000 people and infecting thousands more. The article also claimed that China could impose pharmaceutical export controls which would plunge America into ""the mighty sea of coronavirus.""

The disturbing threats made during a global pandemic as well as the scary consequences if that threat becomes real highlight just how tight China's grip is on the global supply chain. Already, the Food and Drug Administration has announced the first drug shortage related to the coronavirus. Though it did not disclose which drug was in short supply, the FDA did say it could not access enough raw components needed because they are made in China.

That doesn't come as a surprise to Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla, who told Fox News on Thursday that America is ""dangerously reliant"" on China for the production of critical goods, including parts for technologies needed to fight COVID-19.

Though the United States is a global leader in research, much of the manufacturing of life-saving drugs has moved overseas. The last American manufacturing plant to make a key component in penicillin shuttered in 2004. Since then, Chinese pharmaceuticals companies have moved in and taken over, supplying between 80 percent and 90 percent of U.S. antibiotics, 70 percent of acetaminophen and about 40 percent of heparin, according to Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations.

TOP CORONAVIRUS SCAMS TO BE AWARE OF

If China makes good on its threat to cut off the United States, Rubio believes the results could be crippling.

The number of confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide on Thursday went up to 124,518, up from 118,162 cases the day before. In China, there are 80,980 confirmed cases. Italy saw a 22.7 percent jump to 12,462 from 10,149. Iran is hovering close to a 12 percent increase while cases in Qatar jumped 991 percent to 262 cases from 24. In the United States, there are more than 1,300 confirmed cases spread across 44 states and the District of Columbia.

53,China ramps up cremations as COVID-19 cases rise again,"China has already prepared for an inevitable spike in deaths related to COVID-19 after cases surged following the rollback of Beijing’s ""zero-COVID"" policy.

Widespread protests prompted the government to ease the severe restrictions, which many in the country blamed for contributing to the 10 deaths that occurred in a high-rise apartment building fire.

The abrupt change caught China’s health care system unprepared and scrambling to find supplies from beds to drugs to prop up clinics as cases explode.

Major cities in China, including Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu and Wenzhou, have added tens of thousands of fever clinics – temporary attachments to screen for infectious diseases – to hospitals and even sports arenas to help screen residents. Officials stopped reporting asymptomatic figures.

HEALTH EXPERTS ANXIOUSLY WATCH CHINA'S COVID SURGE, SOME FEAR THE COUNTRY IS INADEQUATELY VACCINATED

But experts have already predicted that China could see more than a million COVID-related deaths next year. A spike in March of this year peaked at a rolling average of 26,570, while the current wave already peaked at a rolling average of 40,791 cases with a high of 62,439 new cases on Dec. 2, according to Our World in Data.

A Reuters witness saw a line of about 40 hearses waiting to enter a parking lot outside a crematorium to carry away 20 coffins. Staff wore hazmat suits and smoke rose from multiple furnaces, but it remains unconfirmed – though likely – that the deaths resulted from COVID-19.

WHO Emergencies Director Mike Ryan argued that the virus was already spreading at significant levels before the rollback of ""zero-COVID"" because ""the control measures in themselves were not stopping the disease.""

Part of the difficulty lies in the lack of significant vaccinations in China. Prior to December, China administered only 100,000 to 200,000 doses a day. That number surged to more than 1.43 million on Dec. 13 alone.

CHINA RUSHES TO BOLSTER HEALTH CARE AMID COVID SPIKE OVERWHELMING HOSPITALS

China refused for years to adopt vaccines from the West, relying instead on the Sinopharm vaccine that doesn’t use the mRNA model, which introduces a template for cells to produce antigens without exposing someone to the actual virus. The newer vaccines also allow for quicker scaling and faster production compared to older vaccine models.

And after much delay and deliberation, China approved the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for use, with the first batch sent out Wednesday. No details on the size or timing of the delivery were available.

The vaccine is only available for Germans living in China, but Beijing will consider using the vaccine for Chinese nationals as well. Around 20,000 Germans live in the country. Chinese citizens in Germany will be able to receive China’s SinoVac in exchange.

54,China estimates 250 million people caught COVID-19 since end of 'zero-COVID' policy: report,"Chinese officials estimated that some 250 million people in the country have caught COVID-19 in the past three weeks.

Sun Yang, a deputy director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, presented the figures during a closed-door meeting of high-level officials, according to the Financial Times. The figure, which accounts for 18% of the population, includes 37 million people who were infected on Tuesday alone.

Sun reported that the rate of infection continues to rise and that more than half the population of Beijing and Sichuan have already been infected, two people familiar with the matter said.

Beijing abruptly dropped its ""zero-COVID"" policy, which mandated lockdowns and widespread testing when even just a few cases had been detected. Many had deemed the policies too restrictive and potentially contributing to the deaths of at least 10 people in a high-rise apartment building fire.

CHINA GRAPPLES WITH MASSIVE COVID WAVE WITH FULL EMERGENCY WARDS AND CROWDED CREMATORIUMS: ‘MANY PEOPLE DYING’

The deaths prompted nationwide protests and a demand for the government to end the policy, which Beijing agreed to do – but the sudden change and lack of preparation, including inadequate vaccination levels, led to a surge in the infection rate.

Washington and the World Health Organization have pushed Beijing for greater transparency regarding case numbers, disease severity and other health numbers. Official reports of Wednesday’s meeting provided few details about what top officials discussed.

China also moved to narrow the definition of what qualifies as a COVID-related death, which will reduce the public death tally. Officials reported only eight such deaths since Dec. 1.

Hospitals in Baoding and Langfang have been forced to turn away ambulances and ill patients seeking treatment, while health administrators have been required to treat patients in over-capacity intensive care units on benches or the floor, officials said.

55,Green group influencing Biden admin has deep ties to Chinese government,"The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), a major U.S. green group that has influenced Biden administration policymaking, has deep ties to the Chinese government.

The NRDC, a non-profit organization based in New York City with total assets exceeding $450 million, has worked on climate issues extensively in China since the mid-1990s and several of its top officials have worked for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) or government-sponsored institutions.

The NRDC maintains a close working relationship with President Biden's administration. The NRDC's former president, Gina McCarthy, served as Biden's climate czar up from January 2021 until earlier this month. Current president, Manish Bapna, has attended at least two White House meetings, visitor logs reviewed by Fox News Digital show.

The NRDC regularly communicates with Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry's office on policy issues, according to internal State Department emails obtained by the watchdog group Protect the Public's Trust and shared with Fox News Digital.

On its website, the NRDC highlights its collaboration with a ""wide range of Chinese and international partners"" to boost green policies and ""fortify"" environmental regulations in the country.

JOHN KERRY'S OFFICE CONSULTED LEFT-WING ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS WHILE CRAFTING POLICY, EMAILS SHOW

The NRDC, though, rarely condemns the communist government in China despite the nation's massive world-leading carbon footprint and its commitment to fossil fuel energy. China accounts for about 27% of total global emissions — nearly tripling the total in the U.S., the world's second-largest emitter, according to Rhodium Group — and continues to approve and construct a large amount of coal power plants.

""China has made a serious commitment to turning its cities into healthier places to live and currently leads the world in renewable energy installation and electric vehicle penetration,"" the NRDC website states.

While the group has a sizable international program that extends into Canada, India and Latin America, its sole office outside the U.S. is located in Beijing, China's capital city. The NRDC's Chinese language website states the office is registered under the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau and supervised by the National Forestry and Grassland Administration of China.

The NRDC's most recent tax filings showed that the Chinese office is staffed with 35 employees and has a $4.2 million annual budget. By comparison, the group's international work in North America, South America, South Asia and the Middle East has 11 staffers and a $1.1 million annual budget.

""The NRDC is an independent public-interest group working to protect the environment and public health,"" Amanda Maxwell, the managing director of NRDC’s international program, told Fox News Digital in a statement. ""The central environmental challenges of our time - threats to our oceans and wildlife, toxic chemicals in our food and air, climate change and more - are global problems that demand a global fix.""

""As the world's most populous country, China plays an important role in the search for sustainable solutions,"" she continued. ""That’s what our work is all about. In China, and elsewhere, we’re working to create a cleaner, more sustainable world - for everyone.""

Maxwell said the NRDC has never received any funding directly or indirectly from organizations affiliated with the CCP. The Internal Revenue Service generally does not require nonprofit organizations to publicly disclose donor information.

She added that non-profit organizations like the NRDC are required in China to register with a government sponsor to coordinate in-country activities, explaining why the group's activities are supervised by the National Forestry and Grassland Administration, China's equivalent of the U.S. Department of the Interior.

""We advise our sponsor, the Chinese National Forestry and Grassland Administration, of our work plan for in-country activities involving any Chinese entity, government or private,"" Maxwell told Fox News Digital. ""And we provide the agency with an annual report assessing the outcome of our work, which centers on providing independent analysis and policy recommendations to the government of China.""

""In China, as elsewhere, the NRDC operates in accordance with the law.""

JOHN KERRY'S SECRETIVE CLIMATE OFFICE DISCUSSED KEEPING PLANS OFF 'PAPER,' EMAILS SHOW

Stil, numerous key members of NRDC's Beijing office have previously worked for China's communist government or left the group for a government position.

For example, Jieqing Zhang, the director of NRDC's China program, was the former deputy director-general of China's International Cooperation Department under the Ministry of Ecology and Environment. Kai Duan, an NRDC senior project manager, also worked for a subagency within the Ministry of Ecology and Environment.

JingJing Qian, a current senior strategic adviser for the group's China program, formerly worked at China’s Ministry of Science and Technology. Another senior adviser, Yinying Chen, previously worked in ""universities, government agencies, state-owned enterprises and private companies,"" her NRDC profile says.

Hui Huang, a project manager for NRDC's climate and energy project in China, in the past worked for the China Datang Corporation, a state-owned electricity generation firm.

And, Zhiming Pan, the director of NRDC's city project, was previously an official at the Chinese Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development.

""We strive, in all of our offices, to build teams centered around the most knowledgeable and effective staff available,"" Maxwell said. ""In approving our advocacy positions, in China and the United States, we rely on our U.S.-based executive leadership, and no one else.""

""And there’s no question that all major emitters of greenhouse gases - including the United States, the European Union, China, India, Russia and others - must work to cut the carbon pollution that’s driving the climate crisis,"" she continued.

The NRDC also has regularly published blog posts commending China for its climate actions.

""China’s leaders are sending a clear signal that China’s shift from fossil fuels to clean energy is accelerating and that 'new energy' should be the basis for China’s future energy system, rather than fossil fuels,"" NRDC senior adviser Alvin Lin wrote in 2021.

Another 2021 blog post, from other NRDC experts, claimed China's agreement to a United Nations treaty was ""a major global climate win that should also lend a boost of confidence to broader climate talks heating up this year.""

Andrew Wetzler, NRDC's chief program officer, wrote in 2018 that the ""most exciting work in conservation"" was taking place in China.

""China is doing a lot to address its problems at home and to help fight climate change — starting with the wind turbines I saw from my train window as I traveled from Shanghai to Beijing,"" former NRDC President Rhea Suh wrote in 2016.

JOHN KERRY'S CLIMATE OFFICE RIFE WITH TIES TO FAR-LEFT GREEN GROUPS

The group issued a press release this past April boasting that it had received a thank-you note from the Beijing 2022 Olympic Organizing Committee, which was led by Beijing CCP Secretary Cai Qi, regarding its climate consultation prior to the event.

""We have received a thank-you letter from the Organizing Committee recently,"" the NRDC wrote in the statement. ""We will continue to work hard with key stakeholders to develop and implement concrete measures to ensure that China meets its climate ambitions.""

NRDC's press releases, statements and blog posts about Chinese climate policy often represent a stark contrast with the group's rhetoric and actions in the U.S. where it regularly has criticized a perceived lack of government action and filed environmental lawsuits blocking fossil fuel development.

The organization, which was founded in the 1970s as ""America's ﬁrst litigation-focused nonproﬁt dedicated to making dirty industries clean up their pollution,"" has filed dozens of legal challenges pushing far-left green measures.

Through its legal efforts, the NRDC has opposed domestic oil and gas drilling programs, coal plants, the Keystone XL pipeline and critical mineral mining projects.

The group bragged in December 2019 after it had filed its 100th lawsuit against the Trump administration.

""No administration is above the law — and NRDC will continue to prove that,"" the group said at the time.

The group has continued its anti-fossil fuel litigation efforts since President Biden took office 20 months ago and has demonstrated a large influence on the administration's climate agenda.

""For the enviros, it's really all about power,"" H. Sterling Burnett, the director of the Heartland Institute's Center on Climate and Environmental Policy, told Fox News Digital in an interview. ""It's not about greenhouse gas emissions, is it? Well, if it was, they'd be talking about China all the time, non-stop. They're not.""

""Why is NRDC not attacking China?"" he continued. ""First off, they know that China can just kick them out. Secondly, it's hard to bite the hand that feeds you. If you're being paid not to criticize somebody, then you don't need to criticize them.""

The NRDC's ties to China and the organization's apparent double standard over U.S. climate policies has also drawn the ire of Republican lawmakers.

""The ties environmental groups, like NRDC, have to China is something we are continuing to keep close tabs on,"" a spokesperson for House Natural Resources Committee Ranking Member Bruce Westerman, R-Ark., told Fox News Digital in a statement. ""We’ve done a lot of oversight this Congress and it will continue to be a top priority for Ranking Member Westerman if we take back the House.""

REPUBLICANS SLAM BIDEN'S NEW CLEAN ENERGY CZAR JOHN PODESTA AS CCP 'SHILL' OVER TIES TO TOP CHINESE OFFICIAL

In 2018, Westerman and former Rep. Rob Bishop, R-Utah, who was the chairman of the Natural Resources Committee at the time, wrote to NRDC leadership, requesting more information on its ties to China. The pair suggested the group's apparent affiliation with China could require it to register as a foreign agent.

""The NRDC’s relationship with China has many of the criteria identified by U.S. intelligence agencies and law enforcement as putting an entity at risk of being influenced or coerced by foreign interests,"" Bishop and Westerman wrote in the June 5, 2018, letter.

The letter — which could preview future actions Westerman may take if Republicans win back a majority in the November midterm election — suggested the NRDC may be in violation of the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). FARA defines a foreign agent as ""a person any of whose activities are directly or indirectly supervised, directed, controlled, financed, or subsidized in whole or in major part by a foreign principal.""

""The NRDC’s involvement in China spans two decades and represents a significant investment of time and resources,"" the lawmakers' letter stated. ""The NRDC’s ability to work in China is dependent on the goodwill of the Chinese Government.""

""When engaging on environmental issues concerning China, the NRDC appears to practice self-censorship, issue selection bias, and generally refrains from criticizing Chinese officials,"" they continued.

56,What is China's social credit system?,"Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.

China’s social credit system is a government program being implemented nationwide to regulate its citizens’ behavior based on a point system.

Under this system, citizens are ranked in different areas of civil life using data collected from court documents, government or corporate records, and in some cases, citizen observers.

Citizens with higher scores have had an easier time getting bank loans, free medical checkups and discounts on heating.

Points have been deducted for traffic violations, selling faulty products or defaulting on loan payments. In some cases, people with bad social credit scores have been barred from buying airline or train tickets.

Other infractions have included smoking in non-smoking zones, buying – or playing – too many video games and posting false news stories online, Business Insider reported.

People failing to comply have been placed on so-called “blacklists,” which companies may reference when considering potential employees. In other cases, students may be denied entry into universities because of their parents’ bad social credit scores.

China’s State Council first introduced the plan in June 2014. The council announced the system would “allow the trustworthy to roam everywhere under heaven while making it hard for the discredited to take a single step.”

58,Biden admin defends handing lucrative grant to energy firm with deep China ties,"The Biden administration defended giving a $200 million grant to a battery component manufacturing company with ties to the Chinese government.

In October, the Department of Energy (DOE) awarded the grant to Microvast, a Texas-based maker of technology for electric vehicle batteries, under the $1 trillion infrastructure package President Biden signed into law in November 2021. Microvast was one of just 20 American companies to receive a portion of the nearly $3 billion appropriated for a program designed to boost domestic battery manufacturing capabilities.

However, 69% of Microvast's revenue was generated in China and just 3% came from the U.S., according to a third quarter financial disclosure it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last month. In the same filing, the company acknowledged that the Chinese government ""exerts substantial influence"" over its business activities and ""may intervene at any time and with no notice.""

""Microvast is an American battery company,"" a DOE spokesperson told Fox News Digital in a statement. ""And thanks to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, it no longer needs to look to China to establish its manufacturing facilities. The President’s historic agenda is helping to reshore manufacturing back to the U.S.""

SPECIAL COUNSEL RULES BIDEN'S ENERGY SECRETARY VIOLATED HATCH ACT

""The DOE award to Microvast, coupled with the company’s significant matching funds, will allow Microvast to build a separator production plant here at home,"" the spokesperson added.

But the company's ties to China appear to be deeper than operating a factory in the country.

In 2006, Microvast incorporated in Stafford, Texas, and simultaneously incorporated Microvast Power Systems, a subsidiary firm, in Huzhou, China. Four years later, in 2010, Microvast began producing components for lithium batteries in Huzhou where its subsidiary is based.

Microvast Power Systems also signed an agreement in December 2018 with local government entity Huzhou Saiyuan to issue convertible bonds. As part of the arrangement, Microvast pledged its 12.39% equity holding of Microvast Power Systems to Huzhou Saiyuan to facilitate the issuance of convertible bonds.

GOP HAMMERS BIDEN FOR ALLOWING EMERGENCY OIL RESERVES TO GO TO CHINA: 'COMPROMISING OUR ENERGY SECURITY'

And in its recent SEC filing, the company repeatedly acknowledges the influence the Chinese (PRC) government has over its operations.

""The PRC government may exert, at any time and with no notice, substantial interventions and influences over the manner in which we conduct our business activities, which we may not be able to anticipate,"" the company stated.

""If the PRC government decides to substantially intervene, influence or establish new policies, regulations, rules or laws affecting our business, said substantial intervention or influence may result in a material change to our operations … and could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or to continue to offer securities to investors, and/or cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless,"" it added.

In addition, Yang Wu, Microvast's CEO, chairman and founder, attended Southwest Petroleum University in Chengdu, China.

The infrastructure law, under which the DOE awarded the grant to Microvast, was specifically designed to boost domestic manufacturing capabilities that untethered American supply chains from China. The legislation implores the DOE not to issue grants to companies that ""use battery material supplied by or originating from a foreign entity of concern"" or companies ""subject to the jurisdiction or direction"" of China.

Still, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm touted Microvast and the other grant recipients as examples of companies that would boost ""American-made"" batteries after the agency announced the grants in October. The company said it would use the money to build a factory in Clarksville, Tennessee.

BIDEN ADMIN WON'T SAY IF NON-BINARY OFFICIAL CHARGED WITH STEALING WOMAN'S LUGGAGE STILL GETTING PAID

""This is truly a remarkable time for manufacturing in America, as President Biden’s Agenda and historic investments supercharge the private sector to ensure our clean energy future is American-made,"" Granholm said in a statement at the time.

""Producing advanced batteries and components here at home will accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels to meet the strong demand for electric vehicles, creating more good-paying jobs across the country.""

The announcement didn't mention Microvast's ties to China, instead identifying it as a ""majority U.S.-owned company, traded on NASDAQ and headquartered in Stafford, Texas."" The company went public on the stock exchange via a special-purpose acquisition company in July 2021, allowing it to avoid normal regulatory scrutiny of the traditional initial public offering process.

The SEC placed Microvast on a watchlist in April over financial auditing issues related to its foreign ties, an action that could result in the company being delisted.

The Biden administration chose to award the grant to Microvast despite the SEC's action and despite the company's poor financial performance in recent years. In 2021, the company incurred a net loss of $206.5 million and accumulated a deficit of $632.1 million. Its stock price has fallen more than 80% since it first went public.

""Microvast is and has always been headquartered in Texas and we are actively creating more than 1,000 new American jobs with the expansion of our manufacturing operations in Tennessee, Florida, and Colorado,"" Microvast Chief Operating Officer Shane Smith told Fox News Digital in a statement.

""Microvast is leading the charge to secure domestic battery production, which will strengthen our country’s manufacturing base and reduce reliance on Chinese manufacturers,"" Smith said.

In addition, the company is not ""pro-China"" and is committed to expanding its operations to North America, a Microvast executive told Fox News Digital in a phone interview Friday.

Former President Trump's administration awarded Microvast with a $19 million grant for 12 research projects and Gov. Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., has praised the company for helping ""position Florida as key player in electric vehicle technology development.""

BIDEN'S ENERGY SECRETARY TOOK MEETING WITH BILL GATES IMMEDIATELY AFTER SENATE CONFIRMATION

The Washington Free Beacon first reported Microvast's ties to China.

""Giving hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars to a company whose operations are based in China that refuses to comply with American securities rules is crazy,"" Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. — the vice chair of the Select Committee on Intelligence — told the Washington Free Beacon on Monday. ""What's more, any new technology developed in this partnership is almost certainly going to benefit China given Microvast's operations there.""

""It is just another example of the Biden administration not understanding the threat posed by the Chinese Communist Party.""

The top Republicans on both the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and House Science, Space and Technology Committee also expressed concern following the report, writing letters to Granholm demanding more information about the DOE's vetting of Microvast.

""I remind you that the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law was ostensibly intended to develop robust domestic manufacturing bases and supply chains free from the predations of the PRC,"" Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., the ranking member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, wrote to Granholm.

""DOE distributing $200 million in taxpayer funds to a company joined at the hip with China is demonstrably antithetical to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law’s intent,"" he continued. ""It is clear DOE’s actions directly undermine the United States’ position in its race against China for technological supremacy.""

The dramatic show of force was meant to send a message to the new administration, according to the officials. It marks the second time Beijing flew bombers in the region since Trump was elected.

Even more concerning for the Pentagon, China has been seen by American intelligence satellites preparing to ship more advanced surface-to-air missiles to its contested islands in the South China Sea.

Trump's call with Taiwan's President Tsai ling-wen broke decades- long protocol after American leaders stopped communicating directly with the Taiwan president in 1979, when diplomatic ties were severed and the United States shifted to a new ""one-China"" policy. China protested Trump's call with President Tsai.

MANILA SAYS WILL NOT HELP US ON PATROLS IN SOUTH CHINA SEA

The Chinese H-6 bomber flew along the disputed ""Nine-Dash line"" Thursday, which surrounds the South China Sea and dozens of disputed Chinese islands, many claimed by other countries in the region.

The Pentagon was alerted to the Chinese flight Friday. It was the first long-range flight of a Chinese bomber along the U-shaped line of demarcation since March 2015, according to the officials.

Over the summer, Chinese bombers flew over the South China Sea and the contested islands, but they did not fly nearly as far as this one, the officials said.

At various points in recent long-range flights, Chinese fighter jets provided escorts to the single Chinese bomber.

In recent days, U.S. intelligence satellites have spotted components for the Chinese version of the SA-21 surface-to-air missile system at the port of Jieyang, in southeast China, where officials say China has made similar military shipments in the past to its islands in the South China Sea.

TRUMP'S TAIWAN CALL, TWEETS POINT TO FLASHPOINTS WITH CHINA

In February, Fox News first reported that China had deployed an advanced surface-to-air missile system, the HQ-9, to Woody Island, a contested island in the Paracel Island chain in the South China Sea, also claimed by Taiwan and Vietnam.

The HQ-9 is based on the Russian S-300 missile system and has a range of roughly 125 miles.

The Chinese SA-21 system, based on the more advanced Russian S-400, is a more capable missile system than the HQ-9.

Depending on the types of missiles used, it could extend the range up to 250 miles and target not only aircraft, but ballistic missiles as well.

The head of the U.S. military's Pacific Command, Admiral Harry Harris has repeatedly warned in the past year about China's continued military build-up or ""militarization"" of the South China Sea.

In October, a US Navy destroyer sailed close to Woody Island in what the Pentagon calls a ""freedom of navigation"" operation. The Chinese called the act ""provocative."" It was the fourth such operation by the U.S. Navy in the past year.

China has constructed over 3,000 acres of land atop reefs in the South China Sea in the past few years. It now has three runways and has sent bombers and fighter jets to a number of them.

BIDEN ADMIN HAS 'DEEP CONCERNS' ABOUT CHINA'S 'ALIGNMENT' WITH RUSSIA AMID WAR AGAINST UKRAINE, OFFICIAL SAYS

The call between Biden and Xi comes as Pentagon and intelligence officials warn of the threat China poses to U.S. national security.

Assistant Secretary for Defense for Indo-Pacific Security Affairs Ely Ratner said Tuesday that it is ""only a matter of time"" before a ""major incident or accident"" occurs in the Indo-Pacific amid China’s ""aggressive and irresponsible"" behavior, saying that Beijing has ""escalated tensions"" with its neighbors in the region ""at a pace unseen before.""

The warnings from the Pentagon come just days after Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley directed his staff to collect information on interactions between the U.S. and Chinese militaries in the last five years.

Milley’s directive comes after the U.S. Navy sailed a destroyer close to China-controlled islands in the South China Sea in an operation intended to uphold ""the rights, freedoms and lawful uses of the sea.""

62,Republicans demand answers from Biden officials on report China opened police arm in NYC,"FIRST ON FOX: Several Republican House lawmakers sent a letter to Biden Cabinet Secretaries Antony Blinken and Merrick Garland demanding answers on a reported Chinese police presence in New York City.

Republican Study Committee chairman Jim Banks of Indiana alongside Reps. Michael Waltz of Florida and Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin led the letter to Garland and Blinken demanding answers on why China’s Fuzhou police were reportedly able to open a U.S.-based police arm.

""The Department of Justice and State Department must explain why the Biden administration has allowed CCP police to set up an office on U.S. soil,"" Banks told Fox News Digital in a statement.

CHINA HAS OPENED OVERSEAS POLICE STATIONS IN US AND CANADA TO MONITOR CHINESE CITIZENS: REPORT

""When Republicans take back the House, we will hold the Biden administration accountable for their continued efforts to aid and abet the Chinese Communist Party,"" he added.

Waltz told Fox News Digital it is ""mind-boggling that we are allowing China’s Fuzhou police to operate on American soil.""

""The Chinese Communist Party uses these stations to go after political dissidents abroad, while also endangering the national security of the United States,"" Waltz said in a statement. ""We must protect the American people and Chinese freedom activists from the CCP’s gross abuse of the American justice system,"" he added.

Gallagher warned in a statement that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) ""has used Fuzhou overseas police service stations to push propaganda and spy on Chinese citizens abroad.""

""The presence of one of these stations in New York City not only raises serious human rights concerns, but also raises concerns about whether the United States is allowing a hostile foreign adversary to conduct its own law enforcement activities within our borders,"" the Wisconsin Republican continued.

""The State Department must divulge the extent of their knowledge of this station, it’s actions against American-Chinese citizens and communities, and the threat it may pose to our national security,"" he added.

In the letter exclusively obtained by Fox News Digital, the lawmakers wrote of their ""grave concern over reports of the law enforcement presence"" from China in New York City, noting the ""Public Security (Police) Bureau of Fuzhou, China, announced in January 2022 that it has opened the ‘first batch’ of 30 overseas police service stations in 25 cities in 21 countries,"" with the U.S. branch hosted at the American ChangLe Association, a Chinese overseas hometown association founded in 1998 that ""shoulders the mission of uniting the villagers, fighting for their legitimate rights and interests, promoting the prosperity and stability of the overseas Chinese settlements, and acting as a bridge for the villagers to get rich through hard work,"" according to its website.

""According to a recent report by Safeguard Defenders , a human rights NGO based in Spain, overseas Chinese hometown associations have become overwhelmingly co-opted by the Chinese Communist Party’s United Front organizations which seek increasing control over the Chinese diaspora (despite providing some genuine services to local Chinese communities),"" the lawmakers wrote.

""The report indicates that at least some of those Chinese hometown associations hosting the overseas police service stations are linked to the CCP’s United Front,"" they continued. ""It is deeply troubling that the Chinese government could use these service stations as its long arm policing abroad.""

The Republicans pointed to the United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission’s 2018 report detailing how the ""CCP’s United Front Work Department has worked to suppress the free speech rights of U.S. persons protesting against"" them.

They also warned about Beijing’s coercion and bullying activities to push the CCP’s narrative that sometimes verges into illegal actions.

""According to Peter Mattis, a research fellow at Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, CCP intimidation and efforts to promote Beijing’s narrative ‘sometimes crosses the line into criminal actions, such as conspiracy against rights,’"" the Republicans wrote.

""The U.S. Department of State has similarly found that the CCP’s United Front Work Department funds and supports overseas organizations to spread propaganda and coerces and bullies those who would oppose Beijing’s policies. In 2018, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo imposed visa restrictions on Chinese officials and individuals active in United Front Work Department’s nefarious activities.""

Banks and his fellow Republicans warned that ""Fuzhou overseas police service stations (including their online form) are reportedly involved in fulfilling Chinese law enforcement functions at least in some countries"" and ""coerce purported Chinese fugitives abroad to return to China to face legal proceedings, which is euphemistically dubbed as ‘persuading to return’ in Chinese parlance.""

""There should be no room for the Chinese government to exercise extraterritorial law enforcement unilaterally on U.S. soil,"" the lawmakers wrote. ""In 2018 the U.S. government provided the Chinese government with specific requirements for contacting state and local law enforcement in the United States.""

""In 2020 the Chinese government’s campaign illegally targeting U.S. residents to force their return to China had become so severe that the FBI issued an internal memorandum on this issue. The Chinese overseas police service station established in New York City earlier this year appears to be a further step of China’s illicit long arm policing on U.S. soil that violates our sovereignty.""

The Republicans concluded their letter with several questions to Austin and Blinken, including whether ""the Department of State, Department of Justice, or any other agency of the federal government invite or approve China’s Fuzhou police to establish a presence in New York City.""

Joining Banks, Waltz and Gallagher on the letter are 18 of their fellow House Republicans, including Reps. Elise Stefanik of New York, Greg Murphy of North Carolina, and Clay Higgins of Louisiana.

China’s police presence in New York City is a symptom of the overall larger issue of the CCP’s growing influence abroad.

He is building a huge house in McLean, and plans on working and living in the US.""

It does not appear that Hunter was able to make the China trip during the specific week Person pitched in the email, but multiple emails obtained and reviewed by Fox News Digital showed that Person and Zhang met with Hunter and Hunter’s longtime business partner Eric Schwerin on multiple occasions in Washington, D.C.

One of Zhang's CCP ties was revealed in a December 2013 Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) filing with the Justice Department, which listed Zhang as the ""foreign principal."" The filing noted his relationship with Chinese government official Liu Guoqiang, who was the vice chairman of the Liaoning Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), which is a ""key part"" of China’s ""United Front"" work, The Diplomat reported last year.

Fox News Digital reported in August that Hunter and Schwerin were actively working behind the scenes in 2016 to solicit donations for Person’s failed congressional campaign while also working on business deals with Zhang in China.

Person was seeking the Democratic nomination to unseat Rep. Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C., at the same time that Hunter was introducing him and Zhang to business colleagues via email, including DuPont executive George Duko, Fox News Digital previously reported.

Hunter was also simultaneously sending email pitches to raise money for Person's campaign. Person received $2,700 each from Schwerin and Hunter, including $1,000 from then-second lady Jill Biden. Zhang and his mother, Jinglan Shao, both maxed out to Person’s campaign with two $2,700 donations each.

HUNTER BIDEN'S FOREIGN BUSINESS DEALINGS: 4 COUNTRIES WITH FINANCIAL LINKS TO PRESIDENT'S SON

In a May 2016 email to Henry Zhao, a CCP official and the president and CEO of Beijing-based Harvest Capital Management, Hunter called Zhang his ""good friend and business colleague.""

The New York Post reported in January that Zhao’s fund participated in a Chinese investment fund called Bohai Harvest RST, where Hunter served as a founding board member until October 2019.

In September 2016, Vice President Biden traveled to South Carolina for a fundraiser for Person. A 2014 Politico profile piece on Person quoted second lady Jill Biden as saying, ""Fran has been like a son to Joe and me. For eight years, we traveled the country, shared holidays together … Fran may be leaving the office, but he will always be a part of our family.""

Fox News Digital reported in April that Person visited the Obama-Biden White House at least seven times between 2015 and 2016 after he left the White House to work for Harves. Person and Zhang also both attended a White House holiday reception in December 2015. Person previously told Fox News Digital that the White House visits were ""personal in nature"" and that he was ""visiting with old colleagues and friends"" that he served with for six years during the Obama administration.

On Sept. 12, 2016, Person’s campaign hosted Vice President Biden for a lunch fundraiser in Fort Mill, South Carolina. During the event, Biden said Person had the ""heart of a lion"" and a ""moral compass that has a true north.""

Less than two weeks later, Hunter sent an email to his Delaware contacts letting them know that his father would be hosting another fundraiser for Person at Wilmington Country Club. One of the people who responded and donated $5,400 to Person's campaign, the max amount, was Robert Buccini, who met with Zhang, Hunter and Schwerin earlier that summer to discuss Harves.

The Harves website was taken down recently and currently has a ""Site Currently Unavailable"" message. This comes months after Person deleted his Linkedin account and multiple Fox News Digital reports on Harves and Hunter Biden.

Biden attended at least two more South Carolina campaign events for Person on Nov. 1, 2016, in Sumpter and Rock Hill, which were reported as ""Get Out the Vote"" rallies.

As recently as March 2017, Hunter’s now-defunct private equity firm Rosemont Seneca Advisors held a 5% stake in Harves Amusement Parks and ownership in Harves Sports and Entertainment, both of which fall under the D.C.-based Harves Group. Person previously claimed that ""Hunter Biden, Rosemont Seneca Advisors or any affiliate or associate have never held any equity in any Harves affiliated company,"" despite multiple emails from Schwerin to Hunter contradicting this claim.

Neither Person nor Zhang have been implicated in any professional or criminal misconduct.

HUNTER BIDEN HELPED FORMER BIDEN AIDE WITH HOUSE CAMPAIGN WHILE WORKING WITH HIS CCP-TIED BUSINESS PARTNER

Republican Reps. Ralph Norman of South Carolina and Clay Higgins of Louisiana, also members of Oversight and Reform, told Fox News Digital they will demand answers from ""anyone"" with knowledge of Hunter's Chinese business deals in the new Congress.

""It is our duty on the oversight committee to fully investigate the president’s son’s ties to the Chinese Communist Party,"" Norman said. ""At this point, it is a matter of national security. I believe that it is in the best interest of the American people to call anyone tied to Hunter Biden and Bo Zhang to the stand and demand answers about the coordination between CCP officials and the Biden family.""

""The investigation into the Biden family’s financial ties to the Chinese Communist Party, and any potential corruption, will be one of many investigations conducted next year,"" Higgins said. ""The Oversight Committee will indeed force the reveal of the now hidden 148 suspicious activity reports from American banks on the Biden criminal enterprise. Accountability is coming for the Biden administration. Republicans on the Oversight Committee will call on anyone essential to those investigations.""

Higgins was referring to reports earlier this year that U.S. banks have forwarded nearly 150 suspicious activity reports (SARs) to the Treasury Department that involve a member of the Biden family.

The Treasury adopted a new rule this year that requires the majority party’s consent on a congressional request for SARs, sparking allegations from Republicans that the agency is covering for the Bidens.

President Biden maintains that he has no knowledge of his son's business dealings. Hunter, who is under federal investigation, has denied any wrongdoing.

Neither the White House, Hunter's lawyer, Person nor Zhang responded to Fox News Digital's requests for comment.

65,Space Armageddon: Why the Pentagon fears Russia and China’s star wars weaponry,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

Early last month senior Pentagon officials huddled for two days of top secret discussions about Russia and China’s space weapons. Experts from the U.S. Space Command, the Missile Defense Agency, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the CIA, among others, delivered classified briefings on the grave threat posed by these incredibly destructive high-tech devices. A highly-classified tabletop wargame followed.

The danger of space warfare is increasing, as the two-theater war scenario that the U.S. has long feared is no longer hypothetical. Moscow and Beijing are strengthening their anti-U.S. partnership at a time when Russia is engaged in a brutal war on Ukraine and China is turning ever more aggressive with Taiwan. Having all but lost the conventional phase of the war, Putin is reportedly mulling nuclear warfare, which may trigger NATO intervention even as China menaces Taiwan.

Russian and Chinese strategists view U.S. reliance on space as both our strategic advantage and Achilles heel. Many Americans don’t realize just how dependent we are on space for many aspects of our civilian life, as well as for warfighting. We rely on our satellites for global navigation, water management, power grid monitoring, weather forecasting, broadband access, and telecommunications for applications ranging from banking to education to telemedicine, among other things.

SPACE FORCE GENERAL: CHINA, RUSSIA 'CATCHING UP QUICKLY TO US'

When you use Google Maps to drive to the nearest 7-Eleven, it is powered by the Global Position System (GPS), a constellation of 31 satellites flown by the U.S. Space Force at an altitude of 12,550 miles. Our troops also rely on GPS for tasks like synchronizing operations, pinpointing targets, locating personnel, and doing a myriad of other things in a war zone. In fact, the U.S. government, allied, and commercial satellites have been tracking the movements and activities of Russian forces throughout the conflict in Ukraine, assisting Ukrainians in defending their country.

Having watched American warfighters’ tactics in conflict zones across the globe, Russia and China have concluded that our reliance on technology is a vulnerability to be exploited. Both have developed doctrines and capabilities to deafen and blind our forces. By crippling our satellites – thus disabling communications, reconnaissance, missile warning, navigation, command and control, and other missions – these adversaries seek to negate America's superior conventional firepower.

The Russians believe that taking away what they perceive as the technological ""crutch,"" could paralyze U.S. forces psychologically and disrupt the ""kill chain,"" preventing our weapons from reaching their targets. Chinese strategists call these disruptive technologies an ""Assassin's Mace,"" a concept that conveys an inferior military countering superior one by leveling a playing field with much less expensive options. Remember when insurgents in Afghanistan destroyed expensive U.S. military hardware with homemade IEDs? At approximately $1.7 billion a pop, American space birds present attractive sitting ducks. Even the former STRATCOM commander Gen. John Hyten called U.S. space birds ""big, fat, juicy targets.""

Russia and China are developing and fielding a broad range of anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons. These include jammers, lasers, and orbital interceptors that cozy up to an adversary’s satellites to inspect or attack them. The advantage of less destructive options such as jamming and electronic warfare is that they can be used at the inception of a conflict to destabilize the opponent’s society and create chaos. Imagine not being able to get cash out of an ATM, fill up your car with gas or being stuck in traffic jam on the way to an emergency room.

The most destructive ASAT is a ground-based direct-ascent mobile missile, such as Russia’s PL-19 Nudol, which is capable of permanently destroying spacecraft in low-earth orbit. Russia tested Nudol in November 2021, against a live target, a Russian satellite COSMOS 1408, destroying it and creating 1,500 pieces of trackable orbital debris. Last year, China performed a dual test of a hypersonic weapon and a fractional orbital bombardment, the capability that the head of U.S. Strategic Command described as ""never before seen in the world.""

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

By operationalizing fractional orbital bombardment systems and space-to-ground weapons, Russia and China would markedly offset U.S. conventional superiority, making them more confident about engaging in war with us. Both countries view space as another warfighting domain, along with ground, air, sea and cyberspace.

The Pentagon has known about the possibility of attacks on U.S. space systems since January 2001, when a commission led by the then Defense Secretary-designate Donald Rumsfeld issued a report warning about a space Pearl Harbor. Regretfully, like the IT industry, which was caught off-guard by U.S. adversaries’ advanced cyber capabilities and willingness to hack U.S. networks, the aerospace industry and the Pentagon seem woefully unprepared for the possibility of space warfare with Russia and China.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/space-armageddon-why-pentagon-fears-russia-china-star-wars-weaponry,N/A
66,Tucker Carlson: China is wondering how America could be this stupid and destructive,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

When permanent Washington pushes for war with Russia, who benefits? We don't ask that question enough. The United States certainly doesn't benefit. That's obvious to anyone who thinks about it for a second.

It's so glaringly obvious, in fact, that the people pushing this war immediately denounce you as a traitor if you point that out. They're betraying our country's interests, but somehow you're the one who's disloyal. Ukraine's borders are sacred. Our borders are racist. Shut up, Putin stooge.

But wait a second. Why is it disloyal to side with Russia but loyal to side with Ukraine? They're both foreign countries that don't care anything about the United States. Kind of strange. It's all an absurd performance, but it's all they've got in the end.

The fact is, Ukraine is strategically irrelevant to the United States. No rational person could defend a war with Russia over Ukraine. Nobody thinks a war like that would make America safer or stronger or more prosperous. Have you taken a look at our economy recently? Dangerous levels of inflation, a workforce in disarray. Wildly chaotic swings in financial markets, in case you ever noticed.

TUCKER CARLSON: OUR ATTENTION TO UKRAINE DRIVES RUSSIA INTO ALLIANCE WITH THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT

Well, joining a conflict in Eastern Europe fix any of that? Come on. Of course not. It'll make it worse. If the neocons aren't restrained, and soon, Americans are going to be a lot poorer.

So why are they doing this? That's a complex question. Hubris, stupidity, the damage, psychological makeup of our leaders. Massive lobbying campaigns by Ukrainian politicians and American defense contractors. All of those factors play a role in this. No tragedy has a single cause.

But what's not at all complicated is who benefits from our conflict with Russia. China benefits, period. The Chinese government is the only certain winner here. We can give you many examples to illustrate this, but consider the latest economic sanctions the White House has proposed against Russia.

The Biden administration may use something called the foreign direct product rule to cut off Russia's supply of semiconductors made with American technology. This would, in the hopeful assessment of The Washington Post ""Potentially deprive Russian citizens of some smartphones, tablets and video game consoles.""

So depriving Russian citizens is good, we're told, because Russian citizens are bad. OK, but what are the long-term effects on us? Russians are still going to have smartphones. They'll just get their components somewhere else, meaning from China. The Chinese have already pledged to help, and they have every incentive to make good on that promise.

In other words, the Biden administration will succeed in continuing to drive our two main global rivals closer to a permanent alliance with one another. How does that help America? Well, it doesn't. Over time, it's dangerous, and not just militarily.

CAN BLINKEN'S DIPLOMACY WITH RUSSIA STILL WORK?

The only reason the U.S. government can enforce international sanctions is that the U.S. dollar is the world's reserve currency. Russia and China don't like this, obviously. So let's say they convinced other global powers that the US government was abusing its monopoly on monetary control. If they do it to us, they might do it to you, they would say. And then other countries decided to drop the U.S. dollar in favor of a new currency. Where would that leave us?

Well, suddenly the United States would no longer be able to run an economy based on debt. We would be impoverished immediately overnight. Has no one in Washington thought of this? Apparently not. Imposing tough new sanctions every few months feeds their moral vanity. It makes them feel like good people. What fools they are.

Both parties, by the way, participate in this. Preening about sanctions on television is a lot easier than improving the lives of people in your own country. So that's what they do.

Here's Republican Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa telling you that protecting Ukraine's sacred borders is much more important than, say, saving Americans in Des Moines from overdosing on drugs.

JONI ERNST: So we do need to go ahead and impose sanctions on Russia. Now we need to show them that we mean business and we will be there for Ukraine should they invade. Certainly, we need to make sure that any defensive aid is in the hands of the Ukrainians, as well as much lethal aid as we can provide at this time.

Those are our leaders, totally ignorant, just reading the script. It’d be nice to hear someone in the press corps, because it's their job, ask the obvious follow up, which would be: Why exactly, Sen. Ernst, do you believe it's so vital to send more lethal aid to Ukraine and to ""go ahead and impose"" more sanctions on Russia? Why? How would she answer that question?

We'll never know how she'd answer, because no one in the media would ever ask her. Reporters are the most bovine of the herd animals. If the other kids say it's a good idea, they assume that it is. Journalists feel that way about everything, but especially about armed conflict.

BIDEN SWIPES FOX NEWS REPORTER FOR PRESSING HIM ON GROWING RUSSIA-UKRAINE CONFLICT: ‘WHAT A STUPID QUESTION’

The longest war in American history just ended this fall when we left Afghanistan. The new consensus in Washington is: We need another war, now. And that view is especially prevalent in TV news. This Teleprompter jockey tried to push our Russia hating secretary of state into hating Russia even more.

ANTONY BLINKIN: We are proceeding on both pass at the same time. We'll be ready. Either way, the choice is Vladimir Putin's book.

MARGARET BRENNAN: But what are you negotiating? If Russia's demands are nonstarters, I mean President Biden has already said Ukraine is not going to join NATO anytime soon, you've made this offer of reciprocal military exercises, what's left to talk about?

What's left to talk about? Too much diplomacy, Mr. Secretary, not enough killing. That's her position, apparently.

Max Boot of The Washington Post fervently agrees with this. At this point, every project in Max Boot's life has collapsed into disaster, from his personal affairs to the war in Iraq, which he promoted endlessly. Having come to middle age, Max Boot is unequivocally a failure. But he's looking for one last war to redeem at all. He's thinking conflict with nuclear-armed Russia could be that war.

MAX BOOT: We should be arming the Ukrainians like crazy. We should be preparing for guerrilla warfare. If the Russians go in and I think the most important thing we can do right now is to lay out a menu of sanctions so that Putin knows exactly what's going to happen to him if he goes over the line. Because right now, with these vague threats, he can be left with a feeling, well, maybe the U.S. and the Europeans, maybe we're not. We're not really going to do anything.

Again, you have to ask yourself, why is it more patriotic to take one country's side than the other country's side? We have no obligation to defend any country, either one of these countries. Neither one is American. Neither one has the same interests as we do. Why is it wrong to support one and not the other?

What's wrong is to support either one of them. Their interests are not the same as ours. They're very different. Max Boot doesn't care. Arm the Ukrainians, prepare for guerrilla warfare. Only a man completely insulated from the consequences of his bloodlust could talk like that. There will always be another think tank job for Max Boot and people like Max Boot.

RUSSIA ‘WILL IGNORE’ US TROOPS SENT TO EASTERN EUROPE: FRED FLEITZ

But what's Politico's excuse? The fashionably liberal political blog has been pushing for war in Ukraine for months now. Why? What's in it for them? Well, let's see.

A few days ago, Politico published this terrifying headline ""Psaki: Russia could at any point launch an attack in Ukraine."" The piece goes on to promise that ""experts and policymakers are now preparing for a range of escalatory measures.""

Well, that sounds scary. We better send billions more in military hardware to Ukraine right away. Beneath the headline, you learn why Politico is interested. Because the story is ""presented by Lockheed Martin."" Aha! In other words, defense contractors think it is high time to spend much more on defense contracting in Ukraine. Politico is happy to make their case in exchange for money.

Over at The Washington Post, you may have seen an oped with this headline: ""Biden must show that the United States stands ready to support Ukraine militarily if necessary."" Now, that piece was written by a man called Michael Vickers, who's Michael Vickers, among other things. Michael Vickers sits on the board of the weapons contractor BAE Systems.

That would seem relevant because war with Russia would be potentially, in any case, highly profitable for VA systems. But somehow, the Washington Post didn't bother to tell readers about this. It remained undisclosed.

So how does this look from across the world? Well, the Chinese must be watching this happen with their jaws open, completely delighted. They can't believe their good fortune. They watch as the entire political leadership class of the United States runs at full speed in the wrong direction. Away from Asia, which is so clearly the future and toward the murky past on the fringes of Eastern Europe. Ukraine. Russia.

The Chinese must be wondering how could these people be so stupid and so self-destructive?

67,Warning from US embassy in China signals lockdowns are likely to intensify amid protests,"The U.S. embassy in China released a statement Monday morning calling on U.S. citizens in the country to ""keep a 14-day supply of medications, bottled water, and food for yourself and any members of your household.""

""The People’s Republic of China (PRC) authorities have expanded COVID-19 prevention restrictions and control measures as outbreaks occur. These measures may include residential quarantines, mass testing, closures, transportation disruptions, lockdowns, and possible family separation. Ambassador Burns and other Mission officials have regularly raised our concerns on many of these issues directly with senior PRC officials and will continue to do so,"" the statement reads.

David Tafuri, a former State Department official and foreign policy adviser to the Obama campaign, says the State Department is trying to get ahead of the situation and prevent citizens from being caught up in a tense situation inside China.

PROTESTS RATTLE CHINA AS PEOPLE SAY ENOUGH TO COUNTRY'S DRACONIAN COVID LOCKDOWN POLICIES

""I think this is a message to U.S. citizens in China that the State Department believes the combination of further anti-COVID measures and a potential crackdown on protesters by China could result in further lockdowns and travel bans that could put U.S. citizens at risk for arrest if they leave their homes,"" Tafuri said.

Tumultuous protests broke out in several Chinese cities over the country's ""zero-COVID"" policy and a deadly fire in a high-rise building that cost 10 people their lives.

The building, located in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang province, had been in partial lockdown for nearly two months.

CHINESE POLICE GET VIOLENT AS COVID-19 LOCKDOWN PROTESTS SWEEP ACROSS THE COUNTRY

Miles Yu, a senior fellow and director of the China Center at Hudson Institute, told Fox News Digital that the burning death of 10 people was a trigger for social uprisings, making them different from previous ones in the country.

""The previous [protests] are mostly people from the lower part of the social stratification — that is, the migrant workers. They are the social dispossessed. This time primarily is led by what you might call middle-class people who own properties,"" said Yu. He added that the recent protests ""have a much broader base on the society.""

Tafuri says that ""it’s very rare for there to be protests in mainland China over human rights, so this is worth watching to see if it catches on and results in sustained civil disobedience and demands for China to improve human rights.""

Videos posted online showed police attacking and carrying away some protesters, but there seems to be no immediate response from President Xi Jinping or the Chinese Communist Party.

Tafuri predicts that the demonstration might result in some minor concessions by the CCP, but ""ultimately, China is a police state with more than sufficient means and resources to put down these protests. My guess is that they will crack down on them before they let them spread further.""

Yu warns that ""it could be dangerous because it could give the protesters a false sense of triumph and so on … also it [could] lead the Chinese government to gather its strength and marshal means or assets.""",https://www.foxnews.com/world/warning-us-embassy-china-signals-lockdowns-are-likely-intensify-amid-protests,N/A

In an attempt to protect intelligence sources, U.S. officials have been reluctant to detail what type of aid is being sought.

""We do have deep concerns about China’s alignment with Russia at this time, and the national security adviser was direct about those concerns and the potential implications and consequences of certain actions,"" the official said, without commenting directly to the reports that Russia had requested aid from China after invading Ukraine.

The official, though, maintained that the Biden administration is ""communicating directly and privately to China about our concerns about the kinds of support that other countries might be providing to Russia.""

Sullivan, ahead of the meeting, warned that there ""will absolutely be consequences for large-scale sanctions evasion efforts or support to Russia to backfill them.""

71,Protests in China are about much more than COVID lockdowns,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

The simultaneity and spontaneity of the protests erupting throughout China indicate that there is deep discontent among the Chinese people over much more than just the regime’s draconian and longstanding COVID mandates. Communist officials are of course trying to portray the protests as isolated, merely the result of the most recent round of lockdowns. Yet a whisper that manages to scale totalitarian walls is not just perceptible, it’s booming. And here and today, the message of the Chinese people is resoundingly clear: Something has to change.

In the documentary film The Hong Konger, which in part details the CCP’s shuttering of Hong Kong’s largest-circulation newspaper, Apple Daily, I stressed the importance of remembering that all freedoms are ultimately one—human freedom. Freedom of the press, freedom to assemble, freedom of religion, freedom of commerce, among other universal rights, are all intrinsically interconnected, as we are witnessing now in Mainland China.

We are seeing that regular Chinese people understand this reality and are demanding, an end to not merely the COVID mandates that have weakened China’s prosperity and cost innumerable lives, but Xi Jinping’s tenure and even the end of Communist party rule. This sentiment is summed up by their chant, ""We want freedom!"" and their readiness to display blank pieces of paper, representing the innumerable dissenting news stories and social media posts that have been censored on the CCP-controlled internet.

According to videos circulating online, hundreds of protesters from students to grandmothers are shouting, ""Give me liberty or give me death!"" The very words of American patriots are not uttered by people merely concerned with virus prevention lockdown measures but by rebels seeking to break free of the oppression that imprisons them as surely as any welded gates.

CHINA SAYS IT WILL CRACK DOWN ON ‘HOSTILE FORCES’ AS ANTI-LOCKDOWN PROTESTS CONTINUE

Almost providentially, Jimmy Lai, the publisher of Apple Daily, goes on trial soon in Hong Kong under the national security law that was passed in 2020, largely in response to the massive Umbrella Movement protests in 2019. Lai was front and center at those demonstrations, urging courage and peaceful protest. The legislation is incredibly vague and can be applied retroactively extra-nationally which means that anyone, anywhere in the world they are who is critical of China can be in violation of the law and extradited to the mainland.

Lai is charged with ""colluding with foreign forces"" meaning he has spoken openly with foreign nationals and politicians about the situation in Hong Kong.

The trial will open in Hong Kong, but it remains to be seen if Lai will be transported to the mainland, where access to legal advice and press will be limited. It is virtually a forgone conclusion that a person tried in such a court will be convicted.

Lai’s trial exemplifies the fraudulence and Kafkaesque absurdity of the CCP, which is, in important ways, on fuller display than at any time since tanks rolled into Tiananmen Square in 1989. We cannot allow the Communist regime to confine the Chinese people’s struggle to COVID mandates. Lai’s trail affords the international pro-democracy movement a critical chance to prevent that from happening by amplifying the Chinese people’s cries for freedom into one robust demand for an end to the dictatorship of the CCP.

The spark at Foxconn adds fuel to what is already a burning and pervasive feeling of unease among the Chinese people. We cannot let the Chinese authorities to dilute the reality of the present protests by simply changing COVID policies. Those of us who understand the interconnectedness of human right should be ready to amplify the struggle of the Chinese people in this critical moment.

Combined with the almost inevitably unjust outcome of Lai’s show trial, this might prove the tipping point in much the same way that a Tunisian fruit vender’s self-immolation kicked off the Arab Spring or shipment of highly taxed tea being thrown into Boston Harbor also sparked battles for freedom.

72,McCarthy creates House China Select Committee to confront CCP threats,"House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy on Thursday announced the creation of the China Select Committee, and tapped Rep. Mike Gallagher to chair the panel, which will focus on, and push back against, threats posed by the Chinese Communist Party to U.S. national security.

""The Chinese Communist Party is the greatest geopolitical threat of our lifetime,"" McCarthy said Thursday. ""We need a whole-of-government approach that will build on the efforts of the Republican-led China Task Force and ensure America is prepared to tackle the economic and security challenges posed by the CCP.""

CHINA AND THE US ARE LOCKED IN A COLD WAR. WE MUST WIN IT. HERE'S HOW WE WILL

For those reasons, McCarthy said that under a Republican majority, he will ""establish a Select Committee on China.""

McCarthy tapped Gallagher, R-Wis., to serve as chairman.

""As a Member who served in uniform as a Marine Counterintelligence officer and has dedicated his time in Congress to understanding, educating, and defending America from the threat the CCP poses, Mike Gallagher is exceptionally qualified and is the right person to lead and advance this important agenda at this vital moment,"" McCarthy said.

McCarthy and other top congressional Republicans throughout the midterm campaign cycle stressed the need to hold China accountable.

Gallagher, in a statement to Fox News, thanked McCarthy for the appointment and for his leadership on the issue of China.

""The greatest threat to the United States is the Chinese Communist Party,"" Gallagher told Fox News. ""The CCP continues to commit genocide, obscure the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, steal hundreds of billions of dollars worth of American intellectual property, and threaten Taiwan.""

Gallagher said the new committee will ""push back in bipartisan fashion before it’s too late.""

""Even in divided government, we have an opportunity to build a united front against CCP aggression,"" he said.

Republicans, while in the minority, proposed the creation of a bipartisan China Task Force, but Democrats declined to participate. That panel developed plans to confront threats posed to U.S. national security by the CCP.

When Republicans take the majority in January, the new committee will build on the work already done by the GOP China Task Force.

In a joint op-ed on Fox News Digital, McCarthy and Gallagher wrote that the first step in addressing the threat from China is restoring U.S. supply chains and ending ""critical economic dependencies on China.""

The two also vowed to ""expose our dangerous dependence on China and advance policies to build secure sources for critical supply chains, either in the United States or in partnership with like-minded allies.""

WHITE HOUSE SAYS US, CHINA DIPLOMATIC CHANNELS MAY ‘EXPAND’ FOLLOWING BIDEN, XI MEETING

McCarthy and Gallagher also said the United States must develop ""new weapons and stockpiles to project power, preserve our global influence, and protect our forces, including in space and cyberspace.""

""Further, we will look at how the United States and freedom-loving countries can work together to push viable alternatives to the Belt and Road Initiative,"" they wrote. ""The time-tested formula for victory—while deterring war— as President Reagan proved, is peace through strength.""

Meanwhile, the panel will also expose China’s lobbying efforts at the local, state and federal level to advance the CCP agenda against U.S. interests.

Fox News first reported over the summer that U.S. intelligence community officials have issued stark warnings to state and local leaders who they say are at ""risk"" of being ""manipulated"" to support ""hidden"" agendas by the Chinese Communist Party as China seeks to target officials outside of Washington to lobby for Beijing-friendly policies at the federal level.

The committee is also expected to investigate the CCP’s attempts at infiltrating U.S. academic institutions—specifically with regard to Confucius Institutes in the United States. Those programs have been accused of propagating the Chinese Communist Party’s viewpoints in U.S. classrooms.

China began establishing Confucius Institutes on college campuses in 2004, including its first in the U.S. at the University of Maryland. The number of Confucius Institutes in the U.S. has since expanded to more than 100, which is the most of any country, according to a government report.

There are also Confucius classrooms in K-12 grade schools.

The panel also plans to expose the CCP’s security services and how those officials attempt to ""intimidate and spy on Chinese citizens and Americans here in the United States.""

""In doing all this, the Select Committee will take care to distinguish between the Chinese people and the regime that oppresses them,"" McCarthy and Gallagher wrote.

It's not just Republicans who have been sounding the alarm on the China threat. Top Biden administration officials, like FBI Director Christopher Wray and CIA Director William Burns, have warned that China poses the greatest long-term threat to U.S. national and economic security.

Burns has also warned that China is ""the most profound test the CIA has ever faced,"" calling Beijing a ""formidable competitor lacking in neither ambition nor capability.""

Last year, the CIA created the China Mission Center in order to counter Beijing and ""best position"" the agency to address current and future national security challenges posed by China.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mccarthy-creates-new-house-china-select-committee-taps-gallagher-as-chairman-to-confront-ccp-threats,N/A
73,China's 'zero-COVID' policy could be Xi's undoing,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

If China's dictator Xi Jinping had thought he could begin his third term with firm control of the nation, he is facing a rude awakening. Protests against his cruelty-enforced ""zero Covid"" policy erupted in several Chinese cities last week and have now spread nationwide, with some protestors openly demanding Xi resign.

The canary in the coal mine was a fire in a high-rise apartment in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang and home to millions of Uyghur Muslims and minorities, killing at least ten people and injuring nine. Many people blamed the barriers erected by the local authorities to confine residents inside the apartment, which hindered residents' escape and fire-fighters' rescue efforts, leading to unnecessary deaths. Heartbreaking videos of fire victims desperately crying for help went viral on China's social media before censors took them down.

The Chinese public was outraged by what they saw and couldn't help wondering if a similar tragedy would happen to them and their loved ones. After all, it is common practice for local authorities to seal the front entrance of an entire apartment building or use metal barriers to confine residents inside their homes.

Most Chinese initially supported Beijing's ""Zero Covid"" policy, believing that lockdowns, daily mass PCR testing, and mandatory quarantines were necessary to keep Covid infections under control. Xi Jinping declared China had won the ""people's war"" against Covid in March 2020 and claimed the victory as irrefutable evidence of the superiority of China's political system.

PROTESTS RATTLE CHINA AS PEOPLE SAY ENOUGH TO COUNTRY'S DRACONIAN COVID LOCKDOWN POLICIES

Yet, the government's policy failed as China continues to experience Covid outbreaks due to more infectious Covid-19 variants. Since last fall, the Chinese government has imposed lockdowns on 46 cities and 343 million residents. But as recently as last week, China reported another record number of Covid infections. Yet, the more Xi's ""zero Covid"" policy appears to be failing, the more his underlings have tried to enforce it with a degree of cruelty and zealousness, reminiscent of the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976). For instance, in Xi'an, an eight-month pregnant woman lost her baby after local hospitals refused to treat her because her Covid test was too long.

The lockdowns in Shanghai have drawn much domestic and international attention because Shanghai is China's most prosperous city. Yet, during the lockdowns, residents reported widespread hunger. Individuals with chronic illnesses or medical emergencies missed treatment, and some died. Adults were taken from their homes and forced to spend weeks in poorly run mass quarantine camps, and young children were taken away from their parents. Even the most obedient Chinese citizens began to ask questions such as ""When will this misery end?""

Besides causing human suffering, Xi’s ""Zero Covid"" policy has hurt China’s economy. Analysts cut China’s GDP forecast for 2022 to 2.8%, much lower than Beijing’s official target of 5.5 percent. The unemployment rate for young Chinese aged 16 to 24 reached almost 18 percent. Yet, Xi worsened China’s economic woes by cracking down on private businesses, which had been the engine of China’s three-decade economic growth. His heavy-handed approach has caused a real estate crisis in China, which impaired consumer confidence since most Chinese households’ wealth is tied to the property market.

Chinese citizens also became alarmed when authorities in Zhengzhou, a city in central China, reportedly used a health code system designed for Covid-19 surveillance to prevent depositors of local banks from staging a protest outside the bank that froze their deposits. Many Chinese regarded this incident as a confirmation that the Chinese government has turned the Covid health code into another surveillance tool.

Any hope of Xi easing his ""Zero Covid"" restrictions evaporated after the Communist Party's 20th Congress in October. Xi double-downed his commitment to the ""Zero Covid"" policy by elevating Li Qiang, the Communist Party secretary of Shanghai who was responsible for Shanghai's catastrophic lockdowns, to the second most powerful position in the nation. Li's promotion signals that Xi's ""Zero Covid"" policy is here to stay. The party congress also marked the beginning of Xi's breaking the two-five-year term limit of his position as the head of the state and set to rule China for the rest of his life like an emperor.

Xi must have thought his rule would be secure after spending the last decades consolidating power, eliminating political challengers, and cracking down on dissents. But he misread the public mood. There is an unwritten social contract between the CCP and the Chinese people, in which the Chinese people accepted less political freedom in exchange for rising standards of living, employment, and economic growth. But Xi's ruinous ""Zero Covid"" policy and its devastating tolls on people's lives and the economy are now seen by many as a breach of the social contract.

The fire incident in Urumqi has sparked nationwide protests, including in China's capital Beijing, and financial harbor, Shanghai. Many protesters were seen holding blank paper as a way to object to the government's censorship. Some shouted slogans such as ""Xi Jinping, step down!"" and ""We want freedom and democracy, no more lockdowns."" China hasn't seen such large-scale protests and bold slogans against the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) since the 1989 pro-democracy movement in Tiananmen Square because the CCP has a long history of violently suppressing dissent. But now it seems that the Chinese people are so desperate for change that they are not afraid anymore.

Xi likely will respond to this widespread unrest with brutal force and remain in power. Still, this crisis demonstrates that his rule is not as secure as he had believed. History is sometimes full of irony. Xi values personal loyalty and social stability more than anything. But his insistence on forging ahead with a failed policy to deal with a virus that originated from China and likely escaped from a government-funded lab may eventually cost him loyalty and social stability, becoming the beginning of his own undoing.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/china-zero-covid-policy-xi-undoing,N/A
74,Biden DOJ ending national security initiative aimed at countering China amid complaints about bias,"The Department of Justice announced Wednesday that it is ending its ""China Initiative"" program that was aimed at preventing spying by the Chinese Communist Party, and launching a new, ""broader approach.""

The China Initiative was started in 2018 under the Trump administration to protect U.S. national security against Chinese spying on U.S. intellectual property and in academia. The DOJ website said it was aimed at ""identifying and prosecuting those engaged in trade secret theft, hacking, and economic espionage,"" as well as ""protecting our critical infrastructure against external threats through foreign direct investment and supply chain compromises.""

That program is coming to an end. In its place, the DOJ is instituting a new ""Strategy for Countering Nation-State Threats.""

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT PRESSURED TO END CHINA INITIATIVE AIMED AT TARGETING ESPIONAGE

""Our goal with this strategy is to take a comprehensive approach that draws on the full extent of our tools and authorities to address the alarming rise in illegal activity from hostile nations,"" Assistant Attorney General Matthew Olsen of the DOJ's National Security Division said. ""This includes growing threats within the United States and to Americans and U.S. businesses abroad.""

Olsen said ""the current threat landscape demands a broader approach,"" and cited not just China, but Iran, Russia, and North Korea.

""These nations seek to undermine our core democratic, economic, and scientific institutions,"" he continued. ""And they employ a growing range of tactics to advance their interests and to harm the United States. Defending American institutions and values against these threats is a national security imperative and a priority for the Department.""

Olsen insisted that the new approach does not mean that the agency is losing sight of the threat China poses.

""Make no mistake, we will be relentless in defending our country from China,"" Olsen said.

DOJ had been conducting a review of the China Initiative and changes were expected. The DOJ was concerned that the old program stoked anti-Asian bias after receiving input from the Asian American community.

Attorney General Merrick Garland and the Biden administration had been under pressure from activists and faculty at some universities over the effort. They said it was harming U.S. competitiveness in research and disproportionately targeting people based on race.

CHINESE STATE MEDIA SAYS GWU IS ‘ASYLUM FOR RACISM’ FOR ALLOWING ANTI-CHINESE GOVERNMENT POSTERS

Protesters stood outside the DOJ last month saying the initiative unfairly targeted Chinese professors, and nearly 200 Yale professors recently signed a letter to Garland asking him to end the initiative.

A former Justice Department official lamented that the U.S. ""stopped fighting for the China initiative on Jan 20, 2021,"" the day President Biden took office.

The former official told Fox News China was successful in framing the issue as one of racial bias, and that the U.S. stopped trying to counter this.

""We gave up. You know the champagne corks will be popping at CCP offices. They won the disinformation campaign,"" the former official said.

Olsen acknowledged that part of why they were ending the China Initiative was

""The mere perception of that type of bias undermines our work,"" Olsen said, despite not finding evidence of such bias in his review of the program.

An FBI spokesperson said China remains a priority, however:

""The threat from the Chinese government stands apart. No government poses a broader, more severe threat to our ideas, innovation, and economic security than the government of China does. Together with the Department of Justice and our other partners in the U.S. government, the private sector, and around the world, we will remain relentless countering the Chinese government in the long fight already underway, using every lawful weapon at our disposal – one of which will remain our adherence to the rule of law.""

Left-leaning think tank Brennan Center for Justice argued earlier this year that the initiative should be ended, in part because it hurts the U.S. by scaring away Chinese and Chinese-American scientists.

""To be clear, China poses a legit­im­ate threat of espi­on­age that the Justice Depart­ment and FBI must take seri­ously,"" Brennan Center authors Michael German and Alex Liang said. ""But too often, the Justice Depart­ment has brought cases under the China Initi­at­ive that have not targeted espi­on­age or intel­lec­tual prop­erty theft by Chinese spies but minor admin­is­trat­ive viol­a­tions by scient­ists of Chinese ances­try who are not suspec­ted of affil­i­ation with the Chinese govern­ment.""

75,"China claims ‘unidentified object’ in its airspace, prepared to shoot it down","Chinese authorities have reportedly spotted an unidentified flying object over the waters near a major naval base and were preparing to shoot it down, according to officials.

Maritime authorities in China’s eastern Shandong Province said they had spotted an ""unidentified flying object"" in waters near the coastal city of Rizhao, the state-run Global Times reported Sunday.

Other outlets reported that the object was spotted near Qingdao, which is home to the Jianggezhuang Naval Base, a major naval base for the People’s Liberation Army.

A marine development authority official told The Paper, another Chinese news outlet, that ""relevant authorities"" were preparing to shoot down the object.

RON JOHNSON CALLS BIDEN ‘COMPROMISED’ ON CHINA POLICY AMID SCRUTINY OVER SPY CRAFT: ‘DETACHED FROM REALITY’

The reported sighting comes days after American fighter jets shot down unidentified objects over Canada and off the Alaskan coast. A week before, the U.S. military shot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon, about the size of three school buses, off the coast of South Carolina after it had traversed the continental United States.

The Biden administration said the airship was used for surveillance. China claims it was on a meteorological research mission.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told ABC's ""This Week"" on Sunday that the U.S. believes the unidentified objects shot down were balloons, though smaller than the one downed over the Atlantic Ocean on Feb. 4.

Schumer said teams were recovering debris from the objects and would work to determine where they came from. The ones downed on Friday and Saturday were smaller and flying at lower altitudes of about 40,000 feet, within the airspace occupied by commercial flights, compared with about 60,000 feet for the first one.

And the military and the intelligence are focused like a laser on first gathering and accumulating the information, then coming up with a comprehensive analysis.

These incidents have led to increased tension between Beijing and Washington. Over the weekend, the Navy and Marine Corps were holding joint exercises in the South China Sea – virtually all of which China claims as its own and strongly objects to military activity by other nations in the contested waters.

The U.S. takes no official position on sovereignty in the South China Sea but maintains that freedom of navigation and overflight must be preserved. Several times a year, it sends ships sailing past fortified Chinese outposts in the Spratly Islands, prompting furious protests from Beijing.

76,US admiral says China fully militarized isles in South China Sea,"China has fully militarized at least three of several islands it built in the disputed South China Sea, arming them with anti-ship and anti-aircraft missile systems, laser and jamming equipment and fighter jets in an increasingly aggressive move that threatens all nations operating nearby, a top U.S. military commander said Sunday.

U.S. Indo-Pacific commander Adm. John C. Aquilino said the hostile actions were in stark contrast to Chinese President Xi Jinping’s past assurances that Beijing would not transform the artificial islands in contested waters into military bases. The efforts were part of China’s flexing its military muscle, he said.

BIDEN'S WEAKNESS IN UKRAINE-RUSSIA CONFLICT HAS ONLY FURTHER EMBOLDENED CHINA IN A NEW KIND OF WAR

""I think over the past 20 years we’ve witnessed the largest military buildup since World War II by the PRC,"" Aquilino told The Associated Press in an interview, using the initials of China’s formal name. ""They have advanced all their capabilities, and that buildup of weaponization is destabilizing to the region.""

There were no immediate comments from Chinese officials. Beijing maintains its military profile is purely defensive, arranged to protect what it says are its sovereign rights. But after years of increased military spending, China now boasts the world’s second-largest defense budget after the U.S. and is rapidly modernizing its force with weapons systems including the J-20 stealth fighter, hypersonic missiles and two aircraft carriers, with a third under construction.

Aquilino spoke with the AP onboard a U.S. Navy reconnaissance aircraft that flew near Chinese-held outposts in the South China Sea’s Spratly archipelago, one of the most hotly contested regions in the world. During the patrol, the P-8A Poseidon plane was repeatedly warned by Chinese callers that it illegally entered what they said was China’s territory and ordered the plane to move away.

""China has sovereignty over the Spratly islands, as well as surrounding maritime areas. Stay away immediately to avoid misjudgment,"" one of the stern radio messages said in a veiled threat.

BRIAN KILMEADE: PSAKI PLAYS 'CLEANUP' AFTER BIDEN'S 'HIGH-STAKES' CALL WITH CHINA

But the U.S. Navy plane dismissed the multiple warnings and pressed on defiantly with its reconnaissance in brief but tense moments witnessed by two AP journalists invited onboard.

""I am a sovereign immune United States naval aircraft conducting lawful military activities beyond the national airspace of any coastal state,"" a U.S. pilot radioed back to the Chinese.

""Exercising these rights is guaranteed by international law, and I am operating with due regard to the rights and duties of all states.""

Navy commanding officer Joel Martinez, who led the P-8A Poseidon’s crew, said there has been an incident when a Chinese jet flew close to a U.S. aircraft in a dangerous maneuver in the disputed region. The U.S. flight crew calmly reminded the Chinese to comply with aviation safety regulations, he said.

As the P-8A Poseidon flew as low as 15,000 feet (4,500 meters) near the Chinese-occupied reefs, some appeared to be like small cities on screen monitors, with multi-story buildings, warehouses, hangars, seaports, runways and white round structures Aquilino said were radars. Near Fiery Cross, more than 40 unspecified vessels could be seen apparently anchored.

Aquilino said the construction of missile arsenals, aircraft hangars, radar systems and other military facilities on Mischief Reef, Subi Reef and Fiery Cross appeared to have been completed, but it remains to be seen if China will pursue the construction of military infrastructure in other areas.

STATE DEPT REFUSES TO DETAIL 'RED LINE' IF CHINA PROVIDES SUPPORT TO RUSSIA AMID WAR IN UKRAINE

""The function of those islands is to expand the offensive capability of the PRC beyond their continental shores,"" he said. ""They can fly fighters, bombers plus all those offensive capabilities of missile systems.""

He said any military and civilian plane flying over the disputed waterway could easily get within range of the Chinese islands’ missile system.

""So that’s the threat that exists, that’s why it’s so concerning for the militarization of these islands,"" he said. ""They threaten all nations who operate in the vicinity and all the international sea and airspace.""

China sought to shore up its vast territorial claims over virtually the entire South China Sea by building island bases on coral atolls nearly a decade ago. The U.S. responded by sending its warships through the region in what it calls freedom of operation missions. The United States has no claims itself but has deployed Navy ships and aircraft for decades to patrol and promote free navigation in international waterway and airspace.

China routinely objects to any action by the U.S. military in the region. The other parties — the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei — claim all or part of the sea, through which approximately $5 trillion in goods are shipped every year.

BIDEN WARNS XI OF 'CONSEQUENCES' IF CHINA SUPPORTS RUSSIA, WHITE HOUSE SAYS

Despite China’s aggression, the long-simmering territorial conflicts should only be resolved peacefully, Aquilino said, citing the Philippine government’s successful move to bring its disputes with China to international arbitration in 2013 as a good template.

A U.N.-backed arbitration tribunal that handled the case invalidated China’s sweeping historical claims in the South China Sea under the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea. Beijing dismissed the ruling as sham and continues to defy it.

Washington’s main objective in the disputed region is ""to prevent war"" through deterrence and promote peace and stability, including by engaging American allies and partners in projects with that objective, Aquilino said.

77,"China's interest in US agriculture poses security threat, federal report warns","China’s determination to become self-sufficent and resolve its food security challenges could put the U.S., as the world's leading producer in agriculture, in Beijing’s crosshairs, a federal report warned this week.

The report released by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (USCC) warned that China’s efforts to bolster its agricultural sector not only pose an economic challenge but a threat to U.S. security.

China’s failure to secure enough domestic production to feed its mammoth population means it has looked to nations like the U.S. to acquire farmland, livestock, equipment and intellectual property – in some cases through theft.

""The United States is a global leader in all of these fields, making it a prime trading partner and often a target of China’s efforts to strengthen its agriculture sector and food security, sometimes through illicit means,"" the report stated.

US NOT INTERESTED IN 'COLD WAR' WITH CHINA, PLANS TO INCREASE DIRECT COMMUNICATION: BLINKEN

China is looking to dominate the genetically modified seed industry, which has the potential for massive economic windfalls.

Advancing Beijing’s seed stockpiles would not only reduce its dependence on nations like the U.S., it could make it a major competitor in the global market.

The USCC report found that the U.S. exported $1.62 billion worth of seeds, mostly vegetables, corn, soybeans and grasses, in 2020.

In 2021, $173.9 million of exported seeds were sold to China alone, which equated to roughly 15% of total exports.

Chinese President Xi Jinping has directed the agricultural industry to expand its seed collection as he looks to cut China’s reliance on foreign resources.

Rather than directing its resources for development and research in domestic seed innovations, spying has become a chief tool for its agriculture industry.

""Acquiring U.S. trade secrets through agricultural espionage has become a convenient way for China to improve its agricultural output and become more competitive in global markets,"" the report found. ""Agricultural IP theft could enable Chinese agribusinesses to undercut U.S. competitors on international seed markets.""

But outside the economic woes Beijing could inflict on the U.S. lies an even more ominous threat on U.S. food production.

REPUBLICAN LAWMAKER PUSHES LEGISLATION TO STOP CHINA BUILDING 'AGRICULTURAL MONOPOLY' IN US

Genetically engineered seeds help to circumvent the unpredictable reality the agriculture industry faces every season by mitigating the risk of drought, pests and diseases.

Though the technology behind genetically modifying a crop can save a farming season, it can also be used to target engineered crops.

""One vulnerability of genetically modified seeds is their limited genetic variation. Consequently, a virus or fungus engineered to kill a genetically modified plant could wipe out an entire crop with no genetic variation to mitigate the losses,"" the report found.

House Agriculture Committee Ranking Member Rep. Glenn Thompson told Fox News ""food security is national security"" and said the USCC report showed the U.S. needs to take tougher stances to safeguard U.S. intellectual property and the agricultural industry.

""Our producers go to great lengths to guarantee the U.S. provides the safest food supply, and that cannot be jeopardized,"" he said. ""It is high time to reinforce our battered supply chains and ensure U.S. producers have access to free and fair markets to ease the impact of the looming global food crisis.""

Following the 2001 terrorist attacks, China expressed concern that bioterrorism could be an increasing threat and biosecurity became a chief priority for the nation.

Traditionally, China has been hesitant to import animals and plants that have been genetically modified.

But the report noted that Beijing has ""increasingly acknowledged the strategic advantages [of] genetically modified organisms"" and could be using Western imports to develop its technology and achieve global agricultural dominance.

""The Chinese Communist Party clearly wants to supplant our country’s influence and leadership in every area, including agriculture,"" Ranking Member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Sen. John Boozman told Fox News. ""We must not fall asleep at the switch and give China an opening to exploit.

""The Biden administration and Congress must make every effort to protect our food supply, the intellectual property and technology that make our agriculture industry the envy of the world and our supply chains from vulnerabilities Beijing wishes to leverage to its benefit and U.S. detriment,"" Boozman added.

The USCC said it recommends the intelligence community start working with the United States Department of Agriculture to develop and protect the U.S. agricultural industry and better safeguard it against foreign adversaries like China.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/china-interest-us-agriculture-poses-security-threat-federal-report-warns,N/A
78,Tech with ties to China: What to avoid,"Color me surprised that TikTok hasn’t been banned in the U.S. yet. Can’t stop using it? Take this simple step to keep your data from going back to China.

It's not just apps. More than a third of the world's electronics are produced in China. There's a difference between products made in China and those made by companies with ties to the Communist Chinese government.

Now, before we dive in, know that there are plenty of allegations the companies below have government ties, but it’s up for debate how much the Chinese government is genuinely involved in operations. I'm sharing this to help you make more informed decisions on what you purchase and use daily.

Apps reporting back to China

TikTok is a dominant force. More than 138 million Americans use the video-sharing app owned by a company called ByteDance.

FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr said ByteDance must comply with Chinese government laws. FBI Director Chris Wray said TikTok could be used for ""influence operations"" and that user data is in the hands of the Chinese government.

TIKTOK ALGORITHM MYSTERY: WHAT WE KNOW, AND DON'T KNOW, ABOUT THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT'S CONTROL OF THE APP

That's not just conjecture. Late last year, TikTok was forced to admit that it used this same data to spy on individual Americans, including journalists. Without question, TikTok is a Trojan Horse.

At least 27 states and the federal government have banned the use of the app on government devices. My advice: If you or someone in your family insists on using TikTok, install it on a separate device, like an old smartphone. Don’t connect that device to your home network. Use a cellular connection to get online.

Several states have also banned a few other Chinese-owned apps and platforms. This list includes Weibo, WeChat, and Alibaba.

Security tip: Are you making this huge Wi-Fi mistake?

Smartphones with a line to Communist China

Think about how much data your smartphone collects. For most of us, it's the digital hub of our lives. It knows who you talk to, when you send messages, where you're l

ocated, everywhere you go, and much more.

That's why the United States and a handful of other countries are wary of telecommunications company Huawei. You may consider it a smartphone manufacturer, but the company also designs and sells telecommunications equipment.

The FCC banned sales and imports of Huawei devices in November, citing national security concerns.

Xiaomi, OnePlus, and Oppo have faced similar accusations. A recent report found Chinese-made Android phones include ""an alarming number"" of preinstalled apps that grant dangerous privileges.

The U.S. Department of Commerce’s Entity List is designed to restrict the sale of sensitive goods and technologies to entities that pose a national security concern; 25 Chinese companies and organizations were added in the most recent update.

JOE ROGAN SLAMS TIKTOK: ‘IT ENDS WITH CHINA HAVING ALL OF YOUR DATA’

As Forbes notes, one company that didn't make the list is Lenovo. The computer giant was founded in Beijing, and Forbes reports around 900 U.S. municipalities and states use Lenovo products. Think of the staggering amount of information those systems must contain.

The military isn't taking chances. In 2008, Marines stationed in Iraq stopped using Lenovo tech after discovering data was being transmitted back to China. The U.S. Air Force replaced $378 million worth of servers purchased by Lenovo.

Have a Lenovo machine at home or work? I suggest you replace it.

79,China launches live-fire military drills around Taiwan in fury after Pelosi visit,"China is running a slew of military drills near Taiwan, apparently in anger after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited the disputed island territory.

China's military is running live-fire combat training in the Taiwan Strait, a narrow disputed body of water between mainland China and Taiwan.

The military is reportedly practicing blockades at sea and missile launches, as well as combat on land. The Chinese military is utilizing advanced technology in the drills, including J-20 stealth fighter jets and DF-17 hypersonic missiles.

CHINA FURIOUS AFTER PELOSI LANDS IN TAIWAN, PROMISES ‘ALL NECESSARY MEASURES’ TO DEFEND ITSELF

""In the event of a future military conflict, it is likely that the operational plans currently being rehearsed will be directly translated into combat operations,"" Chinese military official Song Zhongping told the nation's state tabloid, the Global Times.

NANCY PELOSI DEPARTS TAIWAN AFTER VISIT CRITICIZED BY CHINA

""It means that our battle plan has been made clear to the U.S. and the Taiwan authorities, and we are confident enough to inform them of the consequences of further provocation in this way,"" Song said.

The Global Times went on to claim that the exercises would ""enter area within 12 nautical miles of the island and that the so-called median line will cease to exist."" Warships would be ""surrounding"" and ""completely blockading the island demonstrating the Chinese mainland's absolute control over the Taiwan question,"" according to the Global Times.

The People's Republic of China has long claimed sovereignty over Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait, the relatively narrow strip of ocean between the island of Taiwan and the Chinese mainland. The Chinese military has frequently sent planes into the area, testing Taiwan's air defense zone.

The U.S. does not have official relations with Taiwan – also known as the Republic of China – and maintains a "" One China"" policy that recognizes the People's Republic of China as the legitimate successor nation.

China issued stern warnings against Pelosi's visit in previous weeks, including threats from government officials and TV personalities. President Biden revealed weeks ago that the U.S. military ""thinks it's not a good idea right now.""

""People's Liberation Army launches joint military operations around Taiwan island,"" said Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lijian Zhao. ""China resolutely defends its sovereignty and territorial integrity.""

Secretary of State Antony Blinken presided over the launch of the new Office of China Coordination — informally known as ""China House"" — which is set to advance the Biden administration’s ""vision for an open, inclusive international system.""

The State Department said the goal of the initiative is to ""help deliver on elements of the administration’s approach to the PRC (People's Republic of China).""

WHITE HOUSE SAYS US, CHINA DIPLOMATIC CHANNELS MAY 'EXPAND' FOLLOWING BIDEN, XI MEETING

The State Department described ""China House"" as a key component in Blinken’s ""modernization agenda,"" which is focused on ensuring the agency is prepared to meet challenges of the next decade.

""The Secretary and Department leadership are committed to ensuring we have the talent, tools, and resources to successfully execute U.S. policy and strategy towards the PRC as the most complex and consequential geopolitical challenge we face,"" the State Department said Friday.

The office will bring together China experts from throughout the State Department and security officials.

The creation of the office comes after President Biden met with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G-20 summit last month.

""We are encouraged that diplomatic channels of communication not only will stay open, but potentially expand,"" White House National Security Council strategic communications coordinator John Kirby said last week, noting that there are plans for Blinken to travel to Beijing.

Blinken said last month he will travel to China early next year to discuss bilateral issues and maintain open lines of communication following Biden and Xi's meeting, the first time the two leaders met in person since Biden became president.

VP HARRIS, CHINA'S XI MEET TO 'KEEP LINES OF COMMUNICATION OPEN'

A readout from the White House after the meeting said the two ""exchanged views on key regional and global challenges,"" such as Russia’s aggression and threats of nuclear warfare. However, neither Beijing nor Washington made mention of whether any developments were made regarding their differences of opinion when it comes to the war in Ukraine.

China had suspended communications with the U.S. on key international issues over the summer in retaliation for the congressional delegation visit to Taiwan led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. At the time, the Chinese Communist Party announced it canceled all discussions of climate change, drug networks and military action with the U.S.

The meeting in Indonesia between the two leaders, while reopening communications, did not amount to a ""reset"" in U.S.-China relations, Kirby said last month.

81,Chipping away at China’s semiconductor threats to US military,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

Now that House and Senate are resuming work following the elections, one of the top national security priorities for congressional action should be ending purchases of microchips for the U.S. military from companies that work with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). An amendment to the upcoming National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) from Sens. John Cornyn, R-TX, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer appears poised to do just that.

Buying semiconductors for the U.S. defense industry from the People’s Republic of China (PRC) is unacceptable. Semiconductors (commonly referred to as microchips or simply as ""chips"") have become the core currency of contemporary national power. As renown Tufts University Professor Chris Miller has written, we are living in a ""Chip War"" for global primacy.

The countries that control the most advanced semiconductors enjoy superior economic and military power. Modern weapons cannot function effectively without semiconductors. The most important component of modern weapons systems is their computing power.

CHINA INCREASES ABILITY TO STRIKE U.S. WITH SUB-CARRIED MISSILES

One of the main reasons for the U.S. victory in the Cold War against the Soviet Union was that the Soviet military-industrial complex could never match U.S. computing power. Unfortunately, flawed U.S. policies resulted in most semiconductor manufacturing migrating to lower-cost producers in Asia.

Today, Chinese leaders see their path to victory over the West as achieving primacy in microchip production. The current CCP strategy is to decrease China’s dependence on other countries in critical economic areas while making the rest of the world more dependent on China. Accordingly, the Chinese government has been spending billions of dollars to reduce its domestic dependence on foreign chips while increasing the world’s reliance on PRC chip supplies.

In addition to enormous subsidies and cyber-empowered espionage, PRC semiconductor firms benefit from their governments’ practice of ruthless exploiting the country’s vast market power – foreign companies pine for access to the large Chinese consumer market – to coerce these firms into transferring technologies to PRC companies and expand the use of Chinese inputs into their own production.

In any major conflict between China and the United States, PRC attackers would exploit the vulnerabilities they have discovered or planted in CCP-sourced chips in U.S. defense industrial supply chains. The newly released annual report of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission warns that Chinese investment in its offensive cyber capabilities, along with its capacious capacity for intellectual property theft, are creating a serious threat to U.S. critical infrastructure.

Besides economic and security advantages, the Chinese Communist Party also seeks semiconductor primacy to empower its artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. These capabilities presently aim to maximize CCP control over the Chinese people, but China also sees AI as critical for understanding and manipulating international behavior.

Though relying on foreign supply chains for nonessential goods may be acceptable, semiconductors are too precious to depend on foreign supplies. Not only could critical providers exploit this vulnerability for economic or security reasons, but unanticipated natural events such as a major epidemic like COVID-19 can also rupture the receipt of imports.

Apple’s over-reliance on imported Chinese components for the manufacturing of iPhones has made the company’s production highly vulnerable to the CCP’s zero-COVID-19 lockdowns. Other U.S. companies, such as those producing automobiles or providing health-related personal protection equipment, also have suffered from devastating Chinese supply disruptions.

The policy of retaining U.S. military technological superiority over China enjoys bipartisan support in the United States, within both the Congress and the executive branch. In fact, last month, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan affirmed that U.S. policy is to maintain as much as lead as possible over China in the production and employment of semiconductors. Losing such an advantage to China will decrease the U.S. capacity to deter PRC aggression and thereby increase the risks of a China-U.S. war.

The CHIPS and Science Act enacted earlier this year provides important assistance for U.S.-based semiconductor manufactures. Recently enhanced export controls have also succeeded in limiting Chinese companies’ access to the most advanced foreign chips. The next step is to curtail the flow of dollars to Chinese chip producers, which is what Cornyn and Schumer are seeking to ensure in the upcoming NDAA.

The federal government cannot afford to rely on chip suppliers with strong ties to the Chinese Communist Party given the risks that Beijing will exploit this vulnerability for cyber infiltration or attack. And with surging inflation, rising deficits, and escalating Chinese threats, struggling American taxpayers shouldn’t have to support the research, development, and manufacture of Chinese chips.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/chipping-away-china-semiconductor-threats-us-military,N/A
82,China threatens 'countermeasures' against US entities after spy craft shootdown,"The People's Republic of China threatened Wednesday to take action against U.S. agencies responsible for destroying and recovering one of its surveillance balloons.

83,Blinken says China moving on 'much faster timeline' to take Taiwan,"China wants to seize Taiwan on a ""much faster timeline"" under Chinese President Xi Jinping, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Monday.

Blinken's remarks came while speaking at Stanford University during a forum with former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.

""There has been a change in the approach from Beijing toward Taiwan in recent years,"" he said. ""Instead of sticking with the status quo that was established in a positive way, a fundamental decision that the status quo was no longer acceptable and that Beijing was determined to pursue reunification on a much faster timeline.""

On Sunday, Xi called for China to create a world-class military as he declared supremacy over Hong Kong and set his sights on Taiwan, a self-governing island off the Chinese coast that split from the mainland in 1949.

XI JINPING CALLS FOR CHINA TO CREATE 'WORLD-CLASS MILITARY' AS HE TARGETS TAIWAN

China claims the self-ruled island is part of its territory, but Taiwan sees itself as distinct from the mainland.

The comments came during his opening address to the Chinese Community Party Congress in Beijing. Xi spoke before 2,300 CPP delegates who will later vote to grant him an unprecedented third term as China's president and general secretary of the CCP. The leader laid out ambitions for China, declaring a determination to beef up the country's military and take over Taiwan.

""In the face of serious provocations from separatist activities by Taiwan independence forces and interference in Taiwan affairs by external forces, we have resolutely waged a major struggle against separatism and interference, demonstrating our strong determination and ability to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity and oppose Taiwan independence,"" Xi said, according to a translation from Reuters.

Last month, President Biden said the American forces would defend Taiwan if necessary, despite a U.S. policy of being ambiguous on the issue.

""Yes, if in fact there was an unprecedented attack,"" Biden responded to a question about using military force.

Blinken said the Biden administration is committed to the ""one China policy,"" which recognizes the government in Beijing while allowing for informal ties with Taiwan.

Tensions between China and Taiwan have heightened in recent months, especially following a visit to the island by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in August.

The visit saw China, which had threatened to shoot down Pelosi's plane at one point, undertake live-fire military exercises near the border of Taiwan in a show of force.

Pelosi has defended the trip, saying it was worth it to show China the U.S. could not be intimidated.

Gen. Mike Minihan, head of Air Mobility Command, in a memo to all air wing commanders and other Air Force operational commanders said, ""I hope I am wrong. My gut tells me [we] will fight in 2025.""

Minihan said he believes war with China is imminent in the next two years due to the upcoming 2024 elections in the U.S. and Taiwan, which he claimed will ""distract"" Washington and Taipei and enable China to make a move on the island.

DEFENSE SECRETARY AUSTIN 'SERIOUSLY DOUBTS' CHINA INVASION OF TAIWAN IS 'IMMINENT'

The general said a ""a fortified, ready, integrated, and agile Joint Force Maneuver Team ready to fight and win inside the first island chain"" needs to be established to prepare for the looming fight.

Minihan directed his Air Force commanders to report back by Feb. 28 on steps they will take to prepare for the war against China.

He also said all personnel should ensure their records and emergency contact information are up-to-date and to ""consider their personal affairs and whether a visit should be scheduled with their servicing base legal office to ensure they are legally ready and prepared.""

The general reportedly urged his fighting forces to ""run deliberately, not recklessly,"" but said they need to accept some risk in training.

88,These 5 China intelligence failures are even more dangerous than the Chinese spy balloon,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

It might not have been a Sputnik moment, but Americans were unsettled to wake up to the news that a Chinese surveillance balloon was sailing overhead, violating U.S. airspace. Their concern deepened when they learned this wasn’t the first time. Beijing has used similar aerostats to surveil U.S. military installations in Guam and Hawaii and, possibly, strategic early warning sites in Canada.

More shocking, still, was the response by the U.S. government. The Biden administration couldn't seem to explain what was going on or how to respond appropriately. If this were just an isolated let-down, we might be tempted to shrug it off and go back to our morning coffee. But there is a troubling pattern emerging here.

China is the number-one strategic threat facing the U.S. Defending the homeland is Washington’s number one responsibility. If you don't believe me, read President Biden's National Defense Strategy; it says so right there.

This raises an uncomfortable question: What is happening with strategic intelligence under Biden, particularly when it comes to reading China?

IF CHINESE SPY BALLOON ESCAPES US AIRSPACE, GET READY FOR AN EVEN BIGGER DISASTER

Biden's bad balloon day was not a one-off. Let's review some of his other Sino-intel blunders.

5. Whither COVID?

It’s been more than two years since ""COVID-19"" entered our everyday vocabulary, and still we have no clear answer to the question: What was China's role in unleashing the virus on the world? After years of denial, some U.S. officials now admit the virus may well have leaked from a Chinese lab.

Well, thanks, but many folks figured that out back in 2020. By now, you’d think the government could tell us all about the origin and spread of the disease.

Maybe they can’t, maybe they won’t. Either way, it’s a disgrace.

4. Nuke numbers?

How many nuclear weapons does China have? The U.S. government won't tell you. That may be because they don't know.

CHINA TO MORE THAN TRIPLE NUCLEAR WARHEAD STOCKPILE BY 2035, PENTAGON WARNS

The intelligence community will tell you that China is rapidly expanding its strategic force, so much so that Beijing will match—or even overmatch—Russia’s nuclear arsenal. Ours, too. That’s no intel coup. Analysts using open source (unclassified) documents and reports have been telling us that for years.

3. Will China invade Taiwan?

The intelligence community has no consensus assessment on this rather critical matter. We have seen lots of dates thrown around, but when you look into these analyses, there’s no accounting for how they came up with the date. There’s got to be a better method than throwing darts at a calendar.

CHINESE VESSELS AND AIRCRAFT APPEAR IN TAIWANESE WATERS AND AIRSPACE

2. Invading Ukraine?

In retrospect, it's absolutely clear that Beijing gave a green light to the Russian invasion. Did we know that before the Russian invasion? If we did, why didn't we call Beijing out? And now that we do know, why isn't Washington making a big deal out of it?

1. Fallout from Hunter's laptop?

Now we all know that Hunter's laptop was, well, Hunter's laptop. And we know Hunter had lots of dealings with China. So where is the intelligence community’s assessment of the national security risks that may have been exposed?

RATCLIFFE: HUNTER BIDEN LAPTOP WAS A PARTISAN DOMESTIC 'DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN'

If they found some and are withholding that information… Well, that's not comforting either.

When you connect all these dots, it’s not a pretty picture. Either the U.S. intelligence community is not collecting and assessing critical information about the single greatest threat to our security, or they are refusing to share their conclusions?

Is that because it's too important to share, or there is nothing to share, or it’s politically inconvenient to share?

China's National Health Commission said Wednesday that people with asymptomatic COVID-19 cases and those with mild symptoms may now isolate at home instead of being forced into a state-run quarantine facility. Additionally, authorities are loosening testing requirements and travel restrictions within the country, according to a 10-point plan released by the health authority.

""Asymptomatic persons and mild cases can be isolated at home while strengthening health monitoring, and they can transfer to designated hospitals for treatment in a timely manner if their condition worsens,"" the NHC said.

Further, in a dramatic shift, lockdowns will now be limited to individual apartment floors and buildings instead of entire districts or neighborhoods. Nucleic acid test checking on a smartphone app is no longer required to travel to most venues, excepting nurseries, elderly homes and schools. Restrictions on the purchase of over-the-counter cold and flu medications have been also lifted. Businesses will be permitted to re-open in ""non-high risk areas.""

However, China did not reverse its policies until protests erupted following the deaths of at least 10 people who were trapped in an apartment building that caught fire while in lockdown. The people who burned alive could not escape the building because fire exits were reportedly blocked by pandemic barriers.

Public outrage over the deaths was expressed in widespread mass demonstrations against China's draconian ""zero-COVID"" policy. In Shanghai, some protesters shouted the politically explosive demand for Chinese President Xi Jinping, China’s most influential figure in decades, to resign.

Videos posted to social media showed police dragging protesters into custody and dispersing demonstrations with pepper spray and other anti-riot tactics. A BBC journalist covering the protests was arrested and allegedly beaten by police, and law enforcement in hazmat suits were deployed to violently crack down on protesters in Guangzhou.

PROTESTERS IN WUHAN, CHINA SEEN PUSHING THROUGH BARRIER AS US SENATORS WARN AGAINST VIOLENT CRACKDOWN

China has not officially said the changes in COVID-19 policies were in response to the protests. The easing is in line with promises to reduce the human cost of ""zero-COVID,"" including changes announced before the protests that included shorter quarantines for travelers from abroad.

Still, the changes come as Chinese authorities have reported an increase in COVID-19 infections that began in October. On Wednesday, the government reported 25,231 new cases, including 20,912 without symptoms.

Xi’s government has held up ""zero-COVID"" as proof of the superiority of China’s system compared with the United States and Western countries. China’s official death toll is 5,235 since the start of the pandemic versus a U.S. count of 1.1 million.

90,"China accessed data of US TikTok users repeatedly, report says","The Chinese parent company of TikTok had access to American users' data for months even while U.S. employees did not have access themselves, according to leaked audio.

The audio, obtained by BuzzFeed News, covers more than 80 internal meetings at TikTok between the months of September 2021 and January 2022. It showed that U.S. employees were not permitted to access user data and instead relied on Chinese employees to do so, according to BuzzFeed.

TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, is required under Chinese law to share its data with the Chinese Communist Party whenever requested.

""As we've publicly stated, we've brought in world class internal and external security experts to help us strengthen our data security efforts. This is standard industry practice given the complexity of data security challenges,"" TikTok said in a statement to Business Insider on Friday.

91,Gone too soon: Fentanyl flowing from China,"Daniel Puerta-Johnson was an introverted and kind teenager.

His friends would often go to him for relationship advice, Daniel’s father, Jaime Puerta, told Fox News. Daniel was 16 years old during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic when he reached out to a drug dealer on Snapchat.

It was March 2020, and Daniel was battling depression. He was seeking an oxycodone pill to self-medicate.

Jaime thought it was suspicious when Daniel asked to walk the dog one day.

FENTANYL SURGE CREATES WARNINGS FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT: 'THE BORDER IS COMING TO YOU'

In hindsight, Puerta said, Daniel was getting what the teen thought was oxycodone.

But, at dinner a few hours later, all seemed normal to Jaime. The two had a lovely evening together, Jaime recalled. Daniel hugged his father and gave him a kiss on the cheek before saying goodnight just as he had always done.

The next morning, Jaime found Daniel dead is his bedroom. His only son had died of a fentanyl overdose. Jamie was one of 70,000 Americans killed between December 2020 and December 2021, many of them children under 18 like Daniel who tried a pill laced with fentanyl for the first time.

""He was just an innocent kid. He made one dumb decision, and he died. Daniel didn't deserve to die. We're not supposed to bury our children,"" Puerta told Fox, heartbroken over his son's sudden death.

Puerta, a former U.S. Marine, is president of an organization that advocates for victims like Daniel. He spreads awareness so other parents are spared the experience of losing a child as he did. His organization is called Victims Of Illicit Drugs, known as VOID.

Some experts contend the fentanyl problem has become a national security issue involving state-sponsored attacks.

Puerta agrees that it is.

""Is this a way of China attacking our democracy? I would think so. There's so much fentanyl right now in this country that it's enough to kill every single man, woman and child in the United States,"" Puerta said.

China remains the primary source of fentanyl, a drug that kills more than 100 people in the U.S. every day. The Drug Enforcement Administration says China remains the primary global source of fentanyl for the world.

Two techniques are used to deliver the drug to the U.S. It is either shipped to the U.S. directly via international mail or shipped via Mexico. In some cases, Chinese sellers label these deadly drug shipments with Spanish-language advertisements to help clear customs. U.S. lawmakers say the crime syndicates in China operate with the knowledge of the Communist Party.

Once in Mexico, traffickers take the fentanyl to clandestine labs and try to dilute it, often times with imprecise measurements and equipment. It’s then smuggled across the border into the U.S., where they are already partnered with distribution networks. At the end of the supply chain are money laundering networks, set up to get these deadly drugs into the hands of America's unsuspecting youth.

AS FENTANYL DEATH CLIMB, DRUG CARTELS TARGET OUR PRECIOUS TEENS

""The Chinese Communist Party is involved in just about everything economically, business-wise, coming out of China, and you have Chinese scientists that have partnered up with the cartels,"" Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn, told Fox.

Blackburn has teamed up with Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., to sponsor the bipartisan Kids Online Safety Act of 2022. Advocates say the U.S. government needs to view this in terms of national security.

""Fentanyl isn't being sold in any other country in the world other than the United States and Canada,"" Gretchen Peters, executive director of the Alliance to Counter Crime Online, told Fox. ""It's flooding into these countries and, at first, I thought it was an exaggeration that this was in some way state sponsored. Now, I'm not so sure.""

In August 2021, the State Department offered a $5 million reward for information leading to the arrest and/or conviction of People’s Republic of China national Zhang Jian, the leader of the alleged Zhang Drug Trafficking Organization in China.

Between 2013 and 2016, with Zhang acting as principal leader and organizer, the criminal organization imported and distributed fentanyl into the U.S., leading to overdose deaths of four Americans in North Dakota, Oregon, North Carolina and New Jersey, according to the Justice Department. It also led to serious health issues for five other Americans.

China officially banned the production of fentanyl in 2019 under pressure from the Trump administration, pushing the Chinese drug manufacturers into Mexico, which is now a key part of the supply chain.

The Chinese Embassy pushed back in a statement from its spokesperson.

""These assertions are highly irresponsible and utterly false,"" the spokesperson said. ""Up to now, China has not found any scheduled precursor chemicals trafficked to Mexico or received any notification from the Mexican side about seizing scheduled chemicals originating from China.

""Such made-up allegations show zero sense of responsibility towards American fentanyl abuse victims and their families and seriously mislead the Chinese and American people.""

Jaime Puerta suggests parents pay more attention to what their kids do on social media and to talk to them about it often.

""All we need to do is make one bad decision and you're dead. And that's unfathomable. It's unconscionable. And I believe that our government has to do something about this immediately,"" Puerta said.

He wants Daniel to be remembered as a beautiful old soul.

""All he wanted to do was good in this world,"" Puerta said. ""That's all he wanted to do. He just wanted to graduate on stage with his friends. He wanted to go and pursue a college education in systems engineering. He wanted to spend a lot of time with his girlfriend. He wanted to build himself a nice life. And that's all gone.

92,Cultural genocide? What China is doing in Tibet today,"While much of the international community has focused on abuses against the Uighur Muslims in the Chinese province of Xingang, the human rights horrors against Buddhists in Tibet – a decades-long conflict -- have dropped from the limelight.

""Tibet is one of the worst human rights crises in the world today. More than 150 Tibetans have self-immolated since 2009, lighting their own bodies on fire to protest China's oppression,"" Bhuchung K. Tsering, vice president of the International Campaign for Tibet, told Fox News.

""Tibetan schools are forced to teach students in Chinese as the primary language rather than Tibetan. And just recently, Chinese authorities ordered Tibetans to remove their beautiful prayer flags from villages and hilltops. Living under the repressive rule of the Chinese Communist Party, Tibetans have virtually no freedom of religion, freedom of speech, or any of the other basic freedoms that no government has the right to take away,"" Tsering explained.

U.S. watchdog Freedom House lists Tibet as the second-least-free country in the world, behind only Syria.

Concerns over the future of Tibet flared further this week after the Chinese government announced it was shuttering the U.S. Chengdu Consulate, which served the Tibet and other Tibet-populated surrounding regions. The retaliatory move came just days after Washington ordered the Chinese consulate in Houston closed over espionage concerns.

However, foreign policy analysts underscore that closing the Chengdu location was a way to further remove the U.S. from monitoring alleged abuses in Tibet.

Nestled in the southwest crevice of China, Tibet also borders Bhutan, Burma, Nepal and India. Its legal status is also subject to debate – Tibetans claim their country is independent, while the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) of the People's Republic of China (PRC) claims it belongs to them.

ACTIVISTS PUSH FOR INVESTIGATION OVER CLAIMS CHINA IS FORCIBLY HARVESTING ORGANS OF UIGHUR POPULATION

Human rights activists widely claim a multitude of international law violations in the historic, mountainous terrain.

According to Amnesty International's most recent China report, ""the human rights situation continued to be marked by a systematic crackdown on dissent,"" and that Tibetan areas were especially subject to ""repression conducted under the guise of 'anti-separatism' or 'counter-terrorism.'""

In its 2019 Human Rights Situation report, the India-based Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy (TCHRD) claimed that Beijing was using an extensive amount of surveillance technology to ""suppress Tibetans and instill fear,"" and ""violate the right to freedom of expression and privacy of journalists, bloggers, and human rights defenders.""

Others call the CCP's iron-fist ""cultural genocide,"" as the Dalai Lama framed it in 2008.

And even though China's constitution prohibits the state, public organizations and individuals from forcing religion on citizens, the U.S. claims there is anything but religious freedom – especially when it comes to Tibet. The vast majority of ethnic Tibetans practice Buddhism; however, some across the Tibetan Plateau engage in the pre-Buddhist religion of Bon. Small segments also practice Islam, Catholicism or Protestantism.

A State Department report last month stressed that government ""regulations control all aspects of Tibetan Buddhism, including religious venues, groups, personnel and schools,"" and that some in the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) and other Tibetan areas have been subject to ""forced disappearances, arrests, torture, physical abuse, including sexual abuse, and prolonged detentions without trial of individuals due to their religious practices.""

""Former detainees reported being beaten until they lost consciousness and being shocked with electric batons. There were reports that monks and nuns were forced to wear military clothing and undergo political indoctrination in detention centers,"" the report stated. ""The government continued to restrict the size of Buddhist monasteries and other institutions and to implement a campaign begun in 2016 to evict monks and nuns from monasteries and prohibit them from practicing elsewhere.""

Chinese authorities have evicted between 6,000 and 17,000 Tibetan and Han Chinese monks and nuns from Larung Gar and Yachen Gar Tibetan Buddhist Institutes, the report said. Children also were restricted from many traditional religious festivals and from receiving religious education.

The veil of repression and the potential for punishment has, exiled Tibetans say, created such anxiety that many refuse to even utter the name of the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan Buddhist spiritual and political leader.

""From an economic perspective, the CCP wants to extract resources, including water and minerals, to sustain other parts of China,"" surmised Cleo Paskal, non-resident senior fellow for the Indo-Pacific at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD). ""From a strategic perspective, it is moving in major infrastructure, military hardware, and troops to advance its territorial claims on its neighbors, including India.""

CHINA HITS US WITH BLAME FOR 'POISONED' RELATIONS WITH UK OVER FAILED HUAWEI DEAL

Early in the 20th century, Tibet – under the 13th and previous Dalai Lama – had its own currency, national flag, military, passports and diplomats. It remained neutral throughout the Second World War, but in 1950, the newly established communist regime in China under Mao Zedong invaded the land parcel, rich in natural resources and critical in its geography bordering India. The CCP claims Tibet has historically been – and remains – China, while Tibetans cling to their seeds of independence.

Marion Smith, executive director of the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation (VOC), said, ""The CCP has become much more clever at silencing voices in the West who dare to raise awareness about Tibet, especially in Hollywood—just ask Richard Gere.""

The American Hollywood star joined the board of directors at the International Campaign for Tibet in 1992 and passionately called for a boycott of the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games. He claimed in a 2017 interview with the Hollywood Reporter that he was dropped from a number of blockbuster movies because China doesn't like him, and that studio films struggle get financing with his name attached.

Brad Pitt was also once banned from China for having starred in the 1997 hit ""Seven Years in Tibet"" – although he visited the PRC in more recent years.

However, Chinese officials routinely note that over the past four decades, billions have been poured into Tibet to successfully lift it out of poverty, improve human rights and education, and invest in repairs to preserve Tibetan culture.

Despite its disappearance from international diplomacy, Tibet is re-emerging in the widening rift between Washington and Beijing. Weeks before the consulate shutdown, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned that international access to the ""tightly controlled"" TAR was a matter of regional and environmental security, and banned from the U.S. several Chinese authorities who have barred that admittance.

In response, China's foreign ministry announced similar sanctions and urged the U.S. to ""stop interfering in China's internal affairs.""

That demand remains to be seen.

""What Congress needs to do now is pass the Tibetan Policy and Support Act. This bill will dramatically upgrade U.S. support for Tibetans, including by sanctioning any Chinese officials who try to interfere in the succession of the Dalai Lama,"" Tsering added. ""This represents not only a grave violation of the rights of Tibetan Buddhists but also a threat to religious freedom around the globe.""",https://www.foxnews.com/world/cultural-genocide-what-china-tibet-today,N/A
93,"China to suffer over 1 million COVID deaths in 2023, new model predicts","China could experience over one million deaths caused by the spread of COVID next year, according to a new projection.

The U.S.-based Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) announced Friday that Beijing’s decision to abruptly lift restrictions combating its spread could facilitate a rapid spike and spread of the virus, prompting widespread deaths.

A looming infection spike could affect about a third of China's population and cause approximately 322,000 deaths by April 1, IHME Director Christopher Murray said, according to Reuters.

China previously held some of the world’s toughest COVID restrictions and claimed to have maintained a near-zero death rate since the start of the global pandemic in 2019. China lifted the restrictions earlier this month following riots and public protests.

COVID ORIGINS 'MAY HAVE BEEN TIED' TO CHINA'S BIOWEAPONS PROGRAM: GOP REPORT

A surge of more than one million deaths would far surpass China’s total pandemic fatalities, as it officially reports having only 5,235 fatalities over the last three years.

""China has since the original Wuhan outbreak barely reported any deaths. That is why we looked to Hong Kong to get an idea of the infection fatality rate,"" Murray said Friday as the IHME projections were published.

For comparison, the United States officially reports having over 1.1 million COVID deaths, which included a stretch from Dec. 2021 to Jan. 2021 where it averaged thousands of deaths per day.

In Europe, the UK reports having just under 200,000 deaths; Italy reports having just over 180,000 deaths; France and Germany report having approximately 160,000 deaths each; and Spain and Portugal report having 116,000 and 25,000, respectively, according to Worldometers.

""Nobody thought they would stick to zero-COVID as long as they did,"" added Murray, who said COVID cases eventually rose due to the Omicron variant being more infectious.

CDC LAUNCHES NEW SERVICE TO FORECAST INFECTIOUS DISEASES

The IHME model uses vaccination rates provided by the Chinese government and population metrics to determine how the infection rate increases.

Another prediction model shows a similar number of fatalities, in a more accelerated timeframe.

The lifting of COVID restrictions and simultaneously reopening regions in December 2022 through January 2023 would result in 684 deaths per million people — or 964,000 deaths — during that timeframe, according to a paper released from the University of Hong Kong on Wednesday, Reuters reported.

Georges Berges, who is representing Hunter Biden as he ventures into the art world, has talked about his business dealings in China in the past, but his reported ties could pose an ethics issue as he sells Biden's art to anonymous buyers.

A representative for Berges previously told Fox News that the sales of Biden’s art will be kept ""confidential.""

He also said that that he believes ""China's economy is transforming the global economy and everything is changing because of a rising China,"" and that he was fascinated by ""cultural impact"" China is ""having on the world.""

""Cultural power is real power. That is the reason America continues to be the capital of the world, because of its influence on culture for generations and on an unrivaled global level,"" Berges also said. ""And I think more and more the Chinese are beginning to understand that cultural innovation will power their future cultural influence across continents.""

OBAMA ETHICS CHIEF BLASTS BIDEN WH ‘BLIND SPOT’ OVER HUNTER BIDEN MEETING WITH POTENTIAL ART BUYERS

In a 2014 interview with Quest magazine, Berges noted that he travels to China ""three or four times a year"" and that, at the time, he had a ""solid group of about 25 collectors, most of them overseas.""

Berges' reported ties to China and the anonymity of the buyers could pose a potential ethics problem, especially with the younger Biden’s prodigal relationship with President Biden.

Anonymous buyers could have ties to the Chinese Communist Party and could attempt to buy influence in the Biden administration through the art purchases.

Berges has also been quoted in the Chinese state-run newspaper China Daily for his involvement in a philanthropy event with three Chinese artists, whose pieces Berges said ""are not just pretty objects to create, but also challenge the locals' perceptions of what China is and the institutions they live with.""

Additionally, in 1998, Berges was charged with assault with a deadly weapon and ""terrorist threats,"" which were later dismissed after 90 days in jail and 36 months probation.

""People are fed up with the restrictions,"" said Yaqiu Wang, a senior China researcher for Human Rights Watch. ""There's so much pent-up anger and frustration because there have been massive human rights violations as a result of the restrictions, not because of COVID itself.""

Demonstrations erupted across several cities in China in the final days of November as residents took to the streets to protest the nation's ""zero-COVID"" policies. In some cities like Wuhan, protests turned violent as police and residents clashed.

""We often say protest in China is useless because the government is too powerful,"" said Wang. ""But this is an example that if you actually go out and demand for what you want, you get it, or at least you get some of it.""

Chinese officials loosened COVID-19 restrictions after Chinese citizens across several cities protested against the country's strict ""zero-COVID"" policy that has led to city-wide lockdowns, mandatory COVID-19 testing and mass quarantine. Beijing changed course on the strict policies to help quell protests because the ""zero-COVID"" approach is taking a toll on residents, according to a Tiananmen Square protester.

""This has to be understood in the context of three years of draconian COVID restrictions,"" Wang said. To enter a hospital, a grocery store or a company office, Chinese residents ""have to show a negative result.""

""Some people had medical emergencies, but they couldn't get to the hospital because they could not leave their apartment, and some of those people died,"" Wang continued.

Despite Chinese authorities easing restrictions, the surveillance of and crackdown on protesters has been harsh, according to Wang.

""I heard of sources telling me that they went into the protest scenes, and they thought they were anonymous,"" she said. ""But later they were visited by the police.""

""They went to the protest scene yesterday, and they got visited by the police today,"" Wang continued. ""The police were operating in a pretty efficient manner.""

96,"White House says US, China diplomatic channels may ‘expand’ following Biden, Xi meeting","The White House said Monday that diplomatic channels between the United States and China will not only stay open, but may ""potentially expand"" after President Biden’s meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G-20 last month.

White House National Security Council strategic communications coordinator John Kirby said that following the G-20, administration officials ""are encouraged"" by the dialogue between Washington and Beijing and plan to maintain ""open"" channels.

""We are encouraged that diplomatic channels of communication not only will stay open, but potentially expand,"" Kirby said, noting that there are plans for Secretary of State Antony Blinken to travel to Beijing.

KIRBY SAYS BIDEN, XI MEETING WAS 'NOT A RESET' IN RELATIONSHIP BUT A BALANCING ACT

Kirby noted that officials are working through ""the modalities of how those channels are going to stay open.""

Biden and Vice President Harris last month met with Xi at the G-20 summit in Indonesia in an effort to keep the ""lines of communication open"" following years of tensions between the United States and China – and warnings from top U.S. government officials that China poses the greatest national security threat to the country.

The meeting was the first time Biden and Xi met in person since Biden became president.

VP HARRIS, CHINA'S XI MEET TO 'KEEP LINES OF COMMUNICATION OPEN'

A readout from the White House after the meeting said the two ""exchanged views on key regional and global challenges,"" like Russia’s aggression and threats of nuclear warfare. However, neither Beijing nor Washington said whether any developments were made regarding their differences of opinion when it comes to the war in Ukraine.

Blinken said last month he will travel to China early next year to discuss bilateral issues and maintain open lines of communication following Biden and Xi's meeting.

China had suspended communications with the United States on key international issues over the summer in retaliation for the congressional delegation visit to Taiwan led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. At the time, the Chinese Communist Party announced it canceled all discussions of climate change, drug networks and military action with the United States.

The meeting in Indonesia between the two leaders, while re-opening communications, did not amount to a ""reset"" in U.S.-China relations, Kirby said last month.

His comments came in an interview that aired Sunday evening, when a 60 Minutes correspondent asked the president if US forces would defend Taiwan.

""Yes, if in fact there was an unprecedented attack,"" Biden responded.

The president went on to emphasize his administration's support for the ""One China"" policy, which recognizes the government in Beijing while allowing for informal ties with Taiwan.

""Taiwan makes their own judgments about their independence. We are not moving – we're not encouraging their being independent. We're not – that – that's their decision,"" Biden said Sunday.

Tensions between China and the US have escalated in recent weeks following a visit by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., to Taiwan in early August.

While the United States does not have a mutual defense treaty with Taiwan, it does supply the island with weapons. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed a bill on Wednesday that would give Taiwan $4.5 billion for defense over the next four years and designate Taiwan as a non-NATO ally.

99,Can the US catch China’s hypersonic missiles?,"It's been almost one year since China surprised the Pentagon and the world by carrying out a hypersonic glide vehicle test that traveled around the world and landed just two dozen miles from its target.

""The significance was it scared the hell out of everybody,"" Sen. Angus King told Fox News. ""If the thing is dwelling over Kansas City, you're talking you're reducing 15 to 20 minutes to two to three minutes. That's a qualitative change.""

Some officials in the Pentagon described it as a ""Sputnik"" moment because the Chinese leapfrogged the U.S. with a technology that could evade billions of dollars of missile defense, setting off an arms race.

Hypersonic weapons fly at speeds of at least Mach 5, are highly maneuverable, are able to change course during flight and can fly 100 feet above the ocean undetected.

In an exclusive interview with Fox News, Sen. King, I-Maine, who chairs the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Strategic Forces, said the U.S. still lags behind its adversaries.

The senator from Maine blames U.S. fear of failure, which is different from adversaries like China.

""We're probably, I think, five years behind in terms of where the Chinese are,"" King said. ""They don't mind failing in tests. We have this idea that we've got to get it exactly right and every test has to be a success. They have a series of failures, each one of which they learned something.""

King has asked the Pentagon in nearly every public hearing why it isn't investing more in hypersonic technology.

""Frankly, the Chinese and the Russians just plain got ahead of us,"" King said. ""If our strategy in the Pacific is based upon aircraft carriers, and an aircraft carrier is vulnerable to a 6,000-mile-an-hour missile, we're in trouble.""

The U.S. announced a failed weapons test in June. A full hypersonic system for a Common Hypersonic Glide Body atop a two-stage missile booster had failed to detach and reach Mach 5 speeds at a testing site at the Pacific Missile Range Facility in Hawaii, the Pentagon announced.

But, on Tuesday, just days after the failed test announcement, the Pentagon made it a point to announce two recent successful hypersonic tests. One of them, conducted by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in May, demonstrated the first flight test of the ground-based hypersonic boost-glide system to be launched from a standard military truck at White Sands Missile Facility in New Mexico.

More recently, the Air Force successfully tested a hypersonic missile off the coast of Southern California that could be released from under the wing of a B-52 strategic jet bomber.

Russian scientists mocked the failed U.S. hypersonic glide vehicle test last week, saying the U.S. design model for hypersonic weapons is ""too complex."" Congress is seeking $292 million dollars in the new defense bill to fund more research and development for hypersonics.

Sen. King compares hypersonic weapons to the introduction of the longbow, which helped the British beat the French when they were outmanned at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415, and the stirrup, which allowed Ghenghis Khan's soldiers to steady their shot from atop a horse.

""Technological developments often determine the outcome of conflict,"" King said. ""And hypersonic, to me, are the game-changing strategic difference in any future conflict that this country is engaged in. And we're behind.""

At a confirmation hearing earlier this year, John Plumb, first assistant secretary of defense for space policy, agreed.

""It certainly appears that we are behind,"" Plumb said in response to Sen. King in January.

Outgoing Joint Chiefs Vice Chairman General John Hyten was the first to raise the alarm about the U.S. losing the hypersonic race in November.

The U.S. military, realizing the threat these weapons pose, has had to resort to using hot air balloons to provide an early warning system to protect the nation from hypersonic weapons that can now evade U.S. missile defense systems. Congress is requesting $27.1 million for this balloon defense in next year's defense budget

Pentagon officials have publicly pushed back on the narrative that the U.S. has ""fallen behind,"" pointing out that U.S. ballistic missiles and most of its vast nuclear arsenal are already hypersonic, meaning, by definition, they fly five times faster than the speed of sound. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was asked at a press conference in November whether the Chinese hypersonic test was a ""Sputnik"" moment.

""Well, those are terms that I wouldn't use,"" Austin said

When asked why the Chinese have been able to field a medium-range hypersonic weapon and the U.S. had not, Austin bristled.

""I don't know if they fielded those weapons, but they're testing those weapons,"" Austin said.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/us-catch-chinas-hypersonic-missiles,N/A
