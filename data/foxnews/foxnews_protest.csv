Celine Dion fans protest outside Rolling Stone offices after she's left off of '200 Greatest Singers' list,"Celine Dion's fans are showing their loyalty towards the singer in a major way.

On Friday, fans stood outside the Rolling Stone office building in New York City with signs to protest the magazine's decision not to include the ""My Heart Will Go On"" singer on their updated list of the ""200 Greatest Singers of All Time.""

In the video, fans can be seen holding signs which read: ""Justice for Celine,"" ""It's all coming back to you now,"" ""Rolling Stone is stoned"" and ""Celine is not alone Anymooore.""

The fans are reportedly members of a Celine Dion fan club called The Redheads and are based in Montreal, Canada. The group traveled from up north to show support for the Grammy Award-winning singer.

The list was originally published on Jan. 1 and was met with a lot of controversy.

""Anyone who fails to not only mention Celine Dion, but not include her in Top 5 of greatest singers, has no business writing for a music organization. This list is full of disrespect to artists who can actually sing,"" one social media user wrote.

CELINE DION REVEALS INCURABLE NEUROLOGICAL DISORDER DIAGNOSIS IN EMOTIONAL VIDEO

At the beginning of its article, Rolling Stone wrote: ""This new list was compiled our staff and key contributors, and it encompasses 100 years of pop music as an ongoing global conversation."" The decisions were based on ""originality, influence, the depth of an artist's catalog, and the breadth of their musical legacy.""

The magazine also told readers, ""before you start scrolling (and commenting), keep in mind that this is the Greatest Singers list, not the Greatest Voices List.""

""Talent is impressive; genius is transcendent,"" they wrote. ""Sure, many of the people here were born with massive pipes, perfect pitch, and boundless range. Others have rougher, stranger, or more delicate instruments.""

Twitter immediately erupted with anger over the outlet's choice not to include Dion, with on reader stating, ""Look... you can argue Celine Dion's music is not your cup of tea and that's fair. You can argue Celine's songs are now irrelevant in today's Billie Eilish generation and that's also fair. But to say that Celine Dion is not among all-time greatest singers is unbelievable.""

One called leaving Dion off the list ""borderline treasonous,"" calling her ""the best vocal technician of all time."" Another stated: ""If we are going by the mere definition of vocal abilities, then not having Celine Dion is objectively incorrect and would have nothing to do with taste. If we go by sound, you would still be wrong. Ergo, there are some headscratchers with rankings, inclusions, and omissions.""

Artists considered by Rolling Stone to be worthy of being called the top 200 singers of all time include Billie Eilish, Kelly Clarkson, Taylor Swift, Wanda Jackson, Barbra Streisand, Christina Aguilera, Bono, Merle Haggard, Loretta Lynn, Ozzy Osbourne and others.

Dion has yet to react to the list, with the star most recently sharing a compilation of her performing ""My Heart Will Go On"" over the years.

In December 2022, Dion revealed in an emotional video, she was diagnosed with the incurable neurological disorder Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS), which she explained ""affects something like one in a million people.""

""While we're still learning about this rare condition, we now know this is what has been causing all of the spasms I've been having,"" Dion said in her video. ""Unfortunately, these spasms affect every aspect of my daily life, sometimes causing difficulties when I walk and not allowing me to use my vocal cords to sing the way I'm used to.""

The Cleveland Clinic described the syndrome as ""a rare autoimmune movement disorder that affects the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord). People with this condition first experience a stiffening of the muscles of their trunk followed, over time, by the development of stiffness and rigidity in the legs and other muscles in the body.""

Dion announced she will not be able to continue her European tour, which she planned on restarting in February. She also shared that she is working with a ""sports medicine therapist every day to build back (her) strength and my ability to perform again"" which is ""what (she) love(s) to do the most.""",https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/celine-dion-fans-protest-outside-rolling-stone-offices-200-greatest-singers-list,N/A
Hollywood A-listers join protests against controversial Dakota Access pipeline,"A growing number of celebrities are joining the fight against construction of the Dakota Access oil pipeline on tribal land -- including actress Shailene Woodley, who faces trial after her arrest during the protests.

Demonstrations supporting the Standing Rock Sioux tribe's opposition to the pipeline have been ongoing for months -- with more than 260 people arrested so far in North Dakota -- but the protests have intensified in recent weeks, with police in riot gear armed with mase and Taser guns.

Activists fear the nearly 1,200-mile pipeline could harm cultural sites and drinking water for the Standing Rock Sioux tribe. The state and pipeline company, meanwhile, dispute that any sacred grounds have been disturbed during construction.

Woodley, who was arrested Oct. 10 and charged with criminal trespassing and engaging in a riot, could face two months in jail and $3,000 in fines if convicted of the two misdemeanors. She expected to stand trial in January.

Woodley claimed in her Facebook video that police told her she was arrested ""because I'm well-known (and) because I have 40,000 people watching."" Other protesters were reportedly allowed to leave.

one week ago, I was arrested while protecting water against the #dakotaaccesspipeline ... my article on it. https://t.co/hrgF97qHLl — Shailene Woodley (@shailenewoodley) October 20, 2016

Woodley is among several Hollywood stars protesting the $3.8 billion pipeline -- built by Energy Transfer Partners -- which would transfer up to 570,00 barrels of crude oil a day from the North Dakota Bakken region through South Dakota and Iowa into Illinois.

Actor Mark Ruffalo, an outspoken environmental activist, also joined anti-pipeline protestors on the ground in North Dakota. Ruffalo posted a photo to his Instagram account Thursday showing a man hit with rubber bullets in the face during what he insisted was a peaceful protest.

Susan Sarandon, meanwhile, joined hundreds of activists in Los Angeles last week in opposition to the pipeline.

“Not only is it an environmental, but it’s a problem in terms of social justice,” Sarandon told the protestors, according to Reuters. “We can do it. We can stop fracking. We can stop the pipeline. But really it’s only because of great numbers of people.”

Ben Affleck, Ray Fisher, Gal Gadot, Jason Momoa and Ezra Miller — all cast members of the upcoming ""Justice League"" movie — filmed an endorsement for Rezpect Our Water, an anti-pipeline campaign created by young members of the tribe. And in May, Leonardo Dicaprio tweeted that he was standing behind the tribe in their opposition of the pipeline.

Many in Hollywood have become outspoken activists on environmental issues, like climate change and fracking. Earlier this year, Ruffalo narrated and produced, ""Dear President Obama: The Clean Energy Revolution Is Now,"" a documentary looking at Obama's environmental legacy. In 2010, film director Josh Fox produced ""Gasland,"" which spotlights communities across the U.S. impacted by natural gas drilling.

"Missouri nurse fired for refusing flu shot over religious beliefs, protesters claim","A group of protesters gathered outside of Mercy Hospital South in St. Louis Monday to protest the hospital’s policy that requires employees to receive a flu shot, claiming at least one nurse at the facility was fired after she refused to be vaccinated, citing religious reasons.

Nelia Aubuchon, who organized the protest, told Fox 2 a nurse at Mercy Hospital South was terminated after she requested an exemption from the policy on religious grounds. The hospital allegedly refused to grant the nurse’s request and terminated her shortly after, Aubuchon told the news station.

SHOULD YOU GET THE FLU SHOT? WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE 2018-19 FLU SEASON

""Mercy has a policy that says that they accept religious and medical exemptions and yet, in practice, it appears that they are not accepting them; they're denying them,” Aubuchon told the news station, though she wouldn't identify the nurse who was allegedly fired.

""Here at Mercy South, this nurse knows of no other doctor or nurse who actually was granted their religious or medical exemption and, frankly, here we're focused on the religious exemption because this nurse chose rather than being coerced in receiving the shot,” she added.

Aubuchon wrote on Facebook the protest was not about the “efficacy of flu shots [or] mists or a pro or anti-vaccines conversation.” Rather, she explained, “It's about Mercy's denial of ALL religious and medical exemptions for their employees and their draconian measure of terminating those who will not give in to their policy. Mercy Hospital denied ALL doctor and religious leader signed exemption paperwork.”

She also argued the policy constitutes as religious discrimination and violates employees' personal rights.

But Bethany Pope, a spokesperson for Mercy Hospital South, told Fox News the hospital approved “the majority” of the 170 exemption requests it received this year — many of which were “accepted for meeting valid medical or religious exemption criteria.”

In total, the Mercy Health System employs more than 44,000 people, according to Pope.

SOUTH DAKOTA REPORTS FIRST FLU DEATH OF THE SEASON

“The point of our flu vaccination policy is simple: protection against the flu virus saves lives, especially those of our most vulnerable patients. Requiring health care co-workers to be vaccinated for the flu is a best practice across the U.S. to ensure the safety of patients, co-workers and community members. Mercy revised our flu vaccination policy several years ago and requires compliance with the policy by all Mercy co-workers as a condition of employment,” Pope said.

“Those co-workers whose exemption requests were not accepted will be notified this week and, in accordance with our policy, will not be permitted to remain employed without receiving a vaccination. This is an important step in protecting our patients, visitors and co-workers,” she added, noting the hospital's policy regarding a mandatory flu shot is the same “as most hospitals across the country.”

Indeed: A study published in The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) in June found just over 60 percent of U.S. hospitals studied now have a policy that requires employees to receive the flu shot. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also recommends all health care workers -- doctors, nurses, medical and nursing students, dental professionals and pharmacists, among others -- should receive the vaccine.",https://www.foxnews.com/health/missouri-nurse-allegedly-fired-from-hospital-after-refusing-to-receive-flu-shot,N/A
"On this day in history, Dec. 16, 1773, brazen Boston Tea Party protest escalates American rebellion","The Boston Tea Party, a euphemistic name for a dangerous escalation of hostilities between colonists and crown, erupted on the Massachusetts coast on this day in history, Dec. 16, 1773.

""The die is cast,"" Massachusetts rebel leader and future U.S. president John Adams wrote to friend and fellow revolutionary James Warren the day after the protest.

""The people have passed the river and cut away the bridge. Last night three cargoes of tea were emptied into the harbor. This is the grandest event which has ever yet happened since the controversy with Britain opened.""

He added, ""The Sublimity of it, charms me!""

ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, DEC. 16, 1791, BILL OF RIGHTS RATIFIED, CODIFYING UNIQUE FREEDOMS IN NEW NATION

""The die is cast"" was a reference to classical antiquity — the phrase reportedly uttered by Julius Caesar in 49 BC when he led his army across the Rubicon River and marched on Rome in defiance of the Senate.

It references a point of no return.

Indeed, colonial anger with England erupted into rebellion, open warfare and bloodshed 16 months after the Boston Tea Party at the Battles of Lexington and Concord — just a few miles west of the frigid 1773 protest.

The Boston Tea Party unfolded in the wake of the latest in a long list of punitive measures taken by Parliament against the colonies, and against pugnacious tinderbox of rebellion Boston in particular.

""The Sublimity of it, charms me!"" — John Adams

""Parliament authorized the Tea Act on 10 May 1773,"" reports the Massachusetts Historical Society.

""Tea sold in America would carry no duty for the East India Company; instead, the tea would be taxed at the point of entry in colonial ports. Consignees, or special agents, were appointed in Boston, New York City, Philadelphia and Charleston to receive and sell the tea.""

Massachusetts colonists, with the memory of the 1770 Boston Massacre still fresh in their minds, recoiled in anger at the measure.

Their anger turned to action when two British ships, the Eleanor and the Beaver, docked at Griffin's Wharf in Boston packed with tea on December 15.

The Dartmouth, also laden with tea, had landed at the wharf at the end of November.

MASSACHUSETTS RESIDENTS SLAM LIBRARY CHRISTMAS TREE UPROAR AT MEETING:'WHY DO YOU HAT CHRISTIANS'

The following day, ""as thousands of colonists convened at the wharf and its surrounding streets, a meeting was held at the Old South Meeting House where a large group of colonists voted to refuse to pay taxes on the tea or allow the tea to be unloaded, stored, sold or used,"" writes History.com.

""That night, a large group of men — many reportedly members of the Sons of Liberty — disguised themselves in Native American garb, boarded the docked ships and threw 342 chests of tea into the water.""

The protest is recreated each year, with a march from the Old South Meeting House in downtown Boston to the Boston Tea Party Ships & Museum, on wharves surrounded by modern high-rises today.

The protesters ""were ordered by our commander to open the hatches and take out all the chests of tea and throw them overboard,"" protester George Hewes said of the act of rebellion.

Protesters dumped 45 tons of tea into Boston Harbor … worth about $1 million in today's dollars.

""We immediately proceeded to execute his orders, first cutting and splitting the chests with our tomahawks, so as thoroughly to expose them to the effects of the water. We were surrounded by British armed ships, but no attempt was made to resist us.""

It took about 100 men nearly three hours to dump 45 tons of tea into Boston Harbor, according to History.com.

The cargo was worth about $1 million in today's dollars.

ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, SEPT. 27, 1779, JOHN ADAMS ASSIGNED TO LEAD PEACE TALKS WITH ENGLAND

Britain responded in March with its most punitive measures yet, the Coercive Acts.

They closed the port of Boston and ruthlessly ended Massachusetts' long tradition of open town meetings.

The match of revolution had been lit. The people of Massachusetts stood their ground in Lexington in April 1775 and re-took their rights from the British Empire by force.

The British fled Boston March 17, 1776, ending the first phase fo the revolution in victory for Massachusetts, four months before the Declaration of Independence and the continuation of hostilities in the other colonies.

The Boston Tea Party not only led directly to the American Revolution, it also inspired a revolution in our national dietary habits.

Americans today prefer coffee over tea by a wide margin, contradicting global drinking trends, especially those in Britain.

""Coffee’s popularity in the states can be traced back to the Revolutionary War,"" writes Royal Cup Coffee and Tea of Alabama

""John Adams, our second president, even went as far as to declare tea a ‘traitor’s drink,’ and Americans everywhere united and vowed to only serve coffee in their homes. In their minds, tea = British, and drinking it was seen as a betrayal to the colonies!""

CNN panned for on-air graphic reading 'fiery but mostly peaceful protest' in front of Kenosha fire,"CNN was widely mocked late Wednesday after an on-air graphic that was broadcasted a day earlier went viral.

CNN national correspondent Omar Jimenez was reporting live in the early hours on Tuesday morning on the unrest that had taken place in Kenosha, Wis., following the police-involved shooting of Jacob Blake.

Jimenez was standing in front of a raging fire and the chyron at the bottom of the screen read, ""FIERY BUT MOSTLY PEACEFUL PROTESTS AFTER POLICE SHOOTING.""

The image, which didn't surface until Wednesday night, sparked jokes across social media.

CNN REMOVES THE TERM 'VIOLENT' FROM ON-AIR GRAPHIC DESCRIBING PROTESTS IN WISCONSIN

""Clowns. Irresponsible clowns. It’s not even funny. Months of enabling violence and destruction by ignoring and downplaying it, thereby eliminating any pressure on politicians to take action,"" conservative writer A.G. Hamilton reacted.

""The Most 2020 headline you'll ever read..."" comedians the Hodge Twins quipped.

MSNBC'S ALI VELSHI SAYS SITUATION NOT 'GENERALLY SPEAKING UNRULY' WHILE STANDING OUTSIDE BURNING BUILDING

""'Fiery but mostly peaceful protest' is so absurd that if it were satire you’d think it was lazy and unimaginative,"" National Republican Senatorial Committee senior adviser Matt Whitlock wrote.

""The phrase 'beyond parody' doesn’t begin to describe this,"" conservative commentator Matt Walsh said.

New York Post reporter Jon Levine took a screenshot of the graphic and put it side-by-side with an image from the classic Leslie Nielsen comedy ""The Naked Gun"" where his character Detective Frank Drebin attempts to disperse a crowd in front of an exploding building.

""Nothing to see here. Please disperse,"" the caption from Drebin reads as chaos ensued behind him.

Many compared this CNN moment to an on-air moment on MSNBC back in May where anchor Ali Velshi, who was reporting live from Minneapolis following the death of George Floyd, was telling viewers that the situation was ""'generally speaking unruly"" while standing in front of a burning building.

""I want to be clear on how I characterize this. This is mostly a protest. It is not, generally speaking, unruly but fires have been started and this crowd is relishing that,"" Velshi described the unrest.

On Tuesday, CNN similarly raised eyebrows with another graphic that graphic initially said, “8PM CURFEW ORDERED AFTER VIOLENT PROTESTS OVER POLICE SHOOTING OF UNARMED BLACK MAN IN WISCONSIN,” but the message was removed and replaced roughly 5 seconds later without the word “violent.""

CNN's Chris Cuomo blasted for suggesting protesters don't have to be 'peaceful',"CNN anchor Chris Cuomo raised eyebrows on Tuesday night when he suggested that the George Floyd protesters don't have to be ""polite and peaceful.""

Cuomo blasted those who believe the national ""problem"" is the riots that have taken place following the death of George Floyd and not the police brutality that prompted the nationwide protests.

""Now too many see the protests as the problem. No, the problem is what forced your fellow citizens to take to the streets: persistent, poisonous inequities and injustice,"" Cuomo told his viewers. ""And please, show me where it says protesters are supposed to be polite and peaceful. Because I can show you that outraged citizens are what made the country what she is and led to any major milestone. To be honest, this is not a tranquil time.""

CNN'S DON LEMON SAYS 'WE ARE TEETERING ON A DICTATORSHIP' FOLLOWING TRUMP'S GEORGE FLOYD ADDRESS

He later added, ""Police are the ones required to be peaceful, to deescalate, to remain calm.""

Critics slammed the ""Cuomo Prime Time"" anchor, many of them pointing to the Constitution.

""Yeah it's not like the First Amendment specifies our rights as 'peaceably to assemble,'"" The Federalist publisher Ben Domenech quipped.

""Protests absolutely don't have to be polite, but the law says they must be peaceful,"" Washington Examiner reporter Jerry Dunleavy told Cuomo.

DOES TRUMP BEAR RESPONSIBILITY FOR ATTACKS ON JOURNALISTS DURING GEORGE FLOYD PROTESTS?

""Old line: the protests are mostly peaceful. New line: who says protests have to be peaceful?"" National Review editor Rich Lowry wrote.

Donald Trump Jr. accused Cuomo of ""carrying water for violent criminals"" who have caused havoc in cities across the country.

""Imagine saying that less than a day since Captain David Dorn was killed in cold blood by looters? Truly disgusting,"" Trump Jr. wrote, referring to the St. Louis riot victim.

Over the years, Cuomo has been accused of defending Antifa, the self-described ""anti-fascist"" movement that has incited violence at various protests across the country, including the George Floyd protests as many suspect.

Back in 2018, he referred to Antifa as ""counterprotesters"" and argued “all punches are not equal” when they incite violence against racists.

CNN'S OPINION-FUELED ANCHORS 'DISQUALIFY THEMSELVES' FROM MODERATING THE UPCOMING PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES, CRITICS SAY

“If you’re a punk who comes and starts trouble in a mask and hurt people, you’re not about any virtuous cause. You’re just somebody who’s going to be held to the standard of doing something wrong,"" Cuomo explained. “But when someone comes to call out bigots and it gets hot, even physical, are they equally wrong as the bigot they are fighting? I argue no.”

PBS REPORTER FACES BACKLASH FOR TELLING TRUMP THERE'S 'NO EVIDENCE' THAT ANARCHISTS APPEARED AT PROTESTS

During a heated panel discussion in 2019, Cuomo went to bat for Antifa after a guest condemned its violence.

""You can talk about Antifa. I've watched them in streets protesting in different situations, okay?"" Cuomo said. ""There are certainly aspects of them that are true to a cause, that is a good cause, they want social justice, they want whatever they want in that context.""

The CNN anchor clarified that he did not want to ""espouse Antifa,"" which Cortes argued he sounded like he was.

Tulsi Gabbard organizing protest at venue for CNN's town hall after being snubbed from event,"Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, is protesting CNN after the network snubbed her from a Democratic town hall just days before the New Hampshire primary on Feb. 11.

Last week, CNN announced its lineups for a two-night town hall event set in New Hampshire on Wednesday and Thursday. The event is set to feature eight Democrat candidates: former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.; businessman Andrew Yang and billionaire Democratic donor Tom Steyer on the first night, and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.; former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and former Gov. Deval Patrick, D-Mass., on the second night.

Gabbard was noticeably missing from CNN's roster despite her outpolling Patrick in the national polls and outpolling Patrick, Steyer and Yang in New Hampshire. Her campaign is now set to hold a demonstration outside the New Hampshire venue where the CNN town halls will take place, in response to not being invited.

""This attempt to silence Tulsi is bigger than one person -- it’s our right as voters to hear from ALL the candidates, and to have our voices represented. No institution should be allowed to get away with censoring democracy: That’s why we’re standing up to CNN on Wednesday, February 5th, demanding that our voices be heard,"" the Gabbard campaign said.

"Canada truckers' anti-vaccine-mandate protest has important message for politicians, out-of-touch elites","NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

Truckers are a unique breed. There are very few jobs in modern Western life quite so solitary as driving a huge vehicle across the mostly barren landscapes of North America. Miles of road are coursed under heavy tires and light, thoughtful minds free to linger on their own devices.

So the anti-vaccine-mandate protest initiated by these modern-day cowboys in Canada is worth paying attention to. These are people who know a thing or two about freedom. In fact, they base their whole life around it.

What is most telling about the reaction to the protest is the disdain being shown to these truckers by their own government and many in the media. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has dismissed the effort, and apparently gone into hiding as the big rigs surround the capital of Ottawa. He claims that these men and women hold ""unacceptable views."" Heaven forbid.

CRITICS MOCK ‘PUPPET’ TRUDEAU FOR FLEEING CAPITAL DURING TRUCKERS PROTEST: ‘TYRANT ON THE RUN’

You see, for politicians like Trudeau and so many leftists in Canada and the United States, it's not really COVID they are worried about. It's the idea that some people, specifically people who work for a living and aren’t slaves to their handouts, have the audacity not only to disagree with them, but also to ignore them.

Pandemic restrictions and mandates galore are easy to impose on urban dwellers with office and service jobs. They can be and have been crushed with the flick of a governor’s pen. But denizens of the open road, without whom our modern miracle of an existence screeches to a hungry standstill, are not so easy to control.

Most of us in the influencer class, the politicians and pundits, leaders of business and those unsung heroes, Hollywood celebrities, don’t think very much about how things actually get done. Toilets flush, thanks to plumbers, houses are built, thanks to carpenters, and yes, store shelves are stocked (at least they used to be) thanks to truckers. The better sort of people, with their degrees and acceptable views don’t generally have to think much about any of this.

But what the Canadian truck protest shows is that this is a two-way highway. The truckers are just as free to ignore the elites as the elites are to ignore the truckers. The key difference being that the elites don’t produce much beyond noisy chatter.

Over the past week, it has been noticed that the very influencers and outlets who have spent two years lecturing in favor of lockdowns have come to a ""now it can be said"" moment. Maybe kids shouldn’t be wearing masks at school, the New York Times and The Atlantic suddenly opine. Perhaps there is nuance, we now hear from the buttery voices of NPR.

Part of this is because lockdowns have led to embarrassingly bad poll numbers for the favorite party of the elite, but there is something deeper. There is an emerging recognition that regular people, the ones who actually do things and make society function, are under no obligation to listen to the bleatings of the supposedly powerful. Maybe freedom isn’t dead after all.

When those who choose to live a solitary existence, who wish power over no one but themselves, decide to speak out, it is worth listening.

AAPI groups protest California Dem over 'interpreter' comment about Rep. Michelle Steel,"Over 20 Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) advocacy groups protested outside the office of California Democrat congressional candidate Jay Chen last week over a controversial remark he made about California Republican Rep. Michelle Steel.

The protests were sparked by a comment Chen made – first reported by Fox News Digital – in which he said people ""need an interpreter to figure out exactly what [Steel's] saying.""

James Mai and his organization, AAPI United, put together the protest that drew around 75 people and featured representatives from a total of 46 AAPI advocacy groups.

COMMUNITY LEADERS DEMAND JAY CHEN APOLOGIZE FOR STEEL ACCENT COMMENTS AS RACE GETS HEATED

Mai told Fox News Digital in the Thursday phone call that his organization works as ""advocates against racism"" and that ""a number of individuals"" from the AAPI community had contacted him about Chen’s comments.

The activist and the group representatives traveled to Chen’s campaign office to talk with the candidate, but when he and the protesters arrived, it didn’t appear the Democrat was there.

Mai noted that his mother is an immigrant to the U.S. and that both she and Mai’s wife have accents.

""And I would feel strongly if someone, if anyone said that to my mother or my grandmother or anybody else that I knew,"" Mai said when asked how Chen’s comments made him feel, adding that ""racism"" is ""nothing new"" in America.

""We deal with it. But usually, you know, you deal with it from outside of your race or from other parties,"" Mai continued. ""But it was very surprising that it came from another Asian American who shouldn't be saying these things.""

Mai said the average protester’s age was around 60 years old and that the Korean community was ""outraged"" by Chen’s comments, also noting the amount of Vietnam War veterans in the community.

He also added that Chen apologizing was the ""minimum"" of what he could do after his comments ""instead of digging a deeper hole or telling people that it wasn't a situation,"" and that the remarks were ""very damaging"" to him.

Mai also said that Chen is ""absolutely not"" the right man for the congressional job he’s running for after what he has said.

Chen is continuing to face public pressure over his comments and has yet to apologize to Steel for his remarks.

In addition to the protest outside his campaign office, 45 Asian American groups signed onto a letter demanding Chen apologize for his comments.

""As a Korean American, Steel has dealt with racist attacks her whole life, but it never stopped her from proudly sharing her voice on the Board of Equalization, County Board of Supervisors, and now in the halls of Congress,"" the letter led by the Korean American Federation of Orange County read.

""Jay Chen’s comments are despicable and an attack on all Koreans and immigrants, whose voices and accents represent the beauty of our diverse nation,"" the groups continued. ""These attacks hit deep because they highlight a long history of racism toward the entire Asian American community.""

""We stand with Rep. Steel and would have hoped we did not have to explain this to her opponent, a son of immigrants himself,"" they added.

Mai’s comments and the letter came after several California leaders, led by Steel's California Republican colleague Rep. Young Kim, sent a letter to Chen demanding he apologize for his remarks amid a race getting more heated by the day.

The leaders wrote in their letter that, as immigrants and descendants of immigrants, they were ""deeply hurt"" by Chen’s ""recent comment mocking the accent of Congresswoman Michelle Steel.""

When asked for comment, the California Democrat's campaign pointed to an opinion piece published Monday claiming he didn't mock Steel's accent, as well as accusing the freshman congresswoman of fueling ""right-wing disinformation"" and ""falsely"" accusing him ""of mocking her accent.""

Chen touched on his family's experience in America dealing with prejudice and accused Steel of abandoning people ""in order to appease her radical party"" by voting against the Jan. 6 commission.

The Democrat also accused Steel of ""lying to her constituents once again because it’s the only way she can get ahead"" and claimed he was referring ""to a written transcript of Steel’s record of flip-flopping and feeding constituents convoluted talking points instead of the truth – not any kind of audible accent.""

Chen's campaign also pointed to a statement by Orange County Council member Tammy Kim, who is Korean American, that the council member released following her tweet accusing Steel of ""weaponizing anti-Asian hate against one of our own but sat silent while Trump denigrated our community.""

Activists plan Thanksgiving protest at Plymouth Rock against 'genocide' of indigenous people,"Activists will gather for a ""National Day of Mourning"" at Plymouth Rock this Thanksgiving to protest against the ""racism and oppression"" faced by indigenous people throughout history.

Every year, indigenous communities gather in Plymouth, Massachusetts, during the Thanksgiving holiday as ""a reminder of the genocide of millions of Native people, the theft of Native lands and the erasure of Native cultures,"" the event website states.

The United American Indians of New England (UAINE) has been hosting the event for more than 50 years. The group boasted on its website that past demonstrations have included burying Plymouth Rock ""a number of times,"" boarding the Mayflower replica and placing Ku Klux Klan sheets on the statue of Mayflower passenger and Plymouth governor William Bradford.

""Join us as we continue to create a true awareness of Native peoples and history,"" the event description states. ""Help shatter the untrue image of the Pilgrims and the unjust system based on racism, settler colonialism, sexism, homophobia and the profit-driven destruction of the Earth that they and other European settlers introduced to these shores.""

The group is requiring masks at the outdoor march through Plymouth’s historic district, promoting the hashtags #MasksUpMayflowersDown and #NoThanksNoGiving.

THANKSGIVING VILIFIED BY MEDIA AND SCHOOLS AS A CELEBRATION OF ‘GENOCIDE,’ ‘IMPERIALISM’

""Although we very much welcome our non-Native supporters to stand with us, it is a day when only Indigenous people speak about our history and the struggles that are taking place throughout the Americas,"" the description adds.

UAINE says on its website that its volunteers ""speak to classes in schools and universities about current issues in the Native struggle."" The group is backing Massachusetts legislation that would create new public school curriculum standards that teach Native American history, culture and current issues, including ""genocide"" and ""socioeconomic experiences.""

THE FIRST THANKSGIVING STORY SHOWS US HOW DISPARATE PEOPLE COME TOGETHER IN CHALLENGING TIMES

A GoFundMe page for Thursday’s event has fallen far short of its target goal of $50,000, reaching only $9,000 as of Monday morning.

Frank ""Wamsutta"" James, the late Native American activist, founded the National Day of Mourning in 1970, which is now led by his son.

AOC denies 'faking' handcuffs after being detained in Supreme Court protest,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., on Wednesday denied ""faking"" being handcuffed after she and her fellow Squad member, Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., were arrested during an abortion rights protest near the Supreme Court.

Ocasio-Cortez and Omar were among 17 House Democrats who were detained for blocking traffic at the Tuesday protest. Video caught Ocasio-Cortez being escorted by a police officer with her hands behind her back in the typical handcuffs pose. She then raised a fist to the crowd in solidarity, showing she wasn't being constrained.

Omar, too, briefly raised her fist to the crowd while walking away from the protest with her hands behind her back, video showed.

The Democrats received a wave of ridicule from conservatives for the stunt, including Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., who tweeted, ""Politics has become performative art. So of course @aoc fakes being in handcuffs. Performance, not policy, is the name of the game up here.""

Ocasio-Cortez fired back in a tweet saying she placed her hands behind her back because she was trying to avoid escalating the situation.

ABC NEWS HAMMERED FOR MAKING IT LOOK LIKE AOC, OMAR WERE HANDCUFFED AT ABORTION RALLY

""No faking here,"" she wrote. ""Putting your hands behind your back is a best practice while detained, handcuffed or not, to avoid escalating charges like resisting arrest. But given how you lied about a fellow rape survivor for ‘points,’ as you put it to me, I don’t expect much else from you.""

Ocasio-Cortez's feud with Mace dates back to February 2021, after Mace suggested Ocasio-Cortez was exaggerating her fears of being hurt during the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Ocasio-Cortez, a sexual assault survivor, responded by claiming Mace, also a rape survivor, was silencing victims by casting doubt on her claims. A Mace spokeswoman clarified at the time that Mace’s comment ""was a critique of media twisting AOC’s account, not of AOC.""

But Ocasio-Cortez clearly still isn’t over it. In addition to Wednesday's tweet, she tweeted about it again last month, saying she will ""never forget"" what Mace allegedly told her privately after the fact, but she declined to elaborate.

Witthoeft, 58, is being accused of traffic violations, according to U.S. Capitol Police, who said she was taken into custody but later released on Friday.

Officials said that Witthoeft and a group of other demonstrators were walking on a street by the Capitol when police told the group to move off of the road.

Police said that officers were in a line to prevent the group from going further.

"Beto O'Rourke, gun-control advocates protest outside of NRA convention: 'Shame on you'","Former Rep. Beto O’Rourke and hundreds of protesters gathered in downtown Houston on Friday to voice opposition to the 2022 National Rifle Association (NRA) convention beginning Friday in Texas just days after a deadly elementary school shooting in the state.

The protest was organized by several advocacy groups – including Moms Demand Action, March for Our Lives, the Harris County Democratic Party, and Black Lives Matter Houston – and featured speeches from gun control advocates who called for swift legislative measures from elected leaders to protect schoolchildren.

TEXAS GOV. ABBOTT CANCELS IN-PERSON APPEARANCE AT NRA CONVENTION, WILL VISIT UVALDE INSTEAD

The event took place in Discovery Green Park across the street from the George R. Brown Convention Center where the annual gun convention is taking place. The protest comes after 19 children and two adults were shot and killed at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, on Tuesday.

O’Rourke, this year’s Democratic gubernatorial nominee in Texas, stressed that ""the lives of our kids are literally on the ballot"" in November’s election.

O’Rourke, speaking at the protest outside the NRA conference, addressed those gathered inside, saying ""You are not our enemies. We are not yours. We extend our hand open and unarmed in a gesture of peace and fellowship to welcome you to join us to make sure that this no longer happens in this country. But the time for you to respond and to join us is now.""

And he warned that if the NRA and its supporters don’t change course and seek common ground on measures to stem gun violence, ""we will defeat you, and we will overcome you, and we will leave you behind.""

O’Rourke grabbed national attention in the 2018 midterms by coming close to upsetting conservative Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas before launching an unsuccessful bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.

Liz Hanks, the leader of the Texas chapter of the gun control group Moms Demand Action, was one of the main organizers of the event and spoke to those in attendance.

""There is worldwide media here today and do you know why?"" Hanks asked. ""Because we are an embarrassment around the entire world, because we can't protect our children in their schools. We can't protect out children at our churches. We can't protect our community members in their grocery stores. We can't protect people driving down the street.""

CRUZ, NOEM HEADLINE NRA'S FIRST ANNUAL MEETING SINCE START OF PANDEMIC: 'PRO-FREEDOM LINEUP'

""We know how to fix this problem,"" she added. ""We have data that shows us how we fix it.""

Hanks then urged the crowd to turn to the convention center and ""let them know how you feel about how they have not taken action on this issue.""

""Shame on you,"" Hanks said as the crowd began chanting ""shame"" and making obscene gestures towards the center and those in attendance.

TEXAS SCHOOL SHOOTING: LIVE UPDATES

Linda Bennett, who has lived in Houston for the past eight years, told Fox News Digital she wanted to protest because she is ""sick and tired of being sick and tired.""

""The governor that we have now is not going to change any gun laws … assault weapons kill lots of people in a five-minute period."" Bennett said.

Asked what she believes should be done to immediately address the situation, Bennett said, ""The first thing is to ban assault weapons.""

""Nobody needs an assault weapon to protect themselves or their family, absolutely not,"" she said. ""Assault weapons are weapons of war. We're not at war, so there's no reason for anyone in this country to own one and it's shocking to know there are more guns in the United States than there are people. Just let that sink in.""

Francisco Martinez told Fox News Digital that he and his wife Mary traveled more than 10 hours from Roswell, New Mexico, to protest in Houston.

""We drove because we care and we both want to stand up for school kids who cannot speak for themselves,"" Martinez said. ""When will the madness end? This is not hard to solve. How many more will die because politicians do not care?""

""The country is so divided right now and this is a problem everyone wants a solution to,"" he added. ""Now is the time to work together and put school kids first.""

UVALDE, TEXAS SCHOOL SHOOTING: TIMELINE OF MASSACRE THAT LEFT AT LEAST 19 CHILDREN, 2 TEACHERS DEAD

Several elected officials in Texas were initially slated to speak in person at the NRA convention, including Gov. Greg Abbott and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, but those plans were later altered.

On Friday, it was announced that Abbott would deliver a pre-taped video message to those attending the convention and instead travel to Uvalde instead. Patrick announced Friday that he would not be speaking at the convention in an effort to ""focus on the families"" affected by the school shooting.

""Gov. Abbott will be delivering remarks via pre-recorded video to the NRA Conference,"" Abbott campaign spokesman Mark Miner said in a statement on Friday. ""He will be going to Uvalde today.""

"Biden avoids mentioning NYC migrant protest during city visit, touts big spending at rail yard","President Biden traveled to New York City on Tuesday to tout his ""mega"" infrastructure spending, but did not mention the protests taking place on the city streets among illegal migrants who are pushing back on their removal from a Manhattan hotel.

Fox News Digital received no response from Biden ahead of his NYC speech, after he was asked about the migrants who are sleeping outside the Watson Hotel and complaining about conditions at the Brooklyn Terminal Center. Biden also did not address the ongoing situation during his speech Tuesday touting the major infrastructure law.

""This law is the most significant investment in rail… since we created Amtrak,"" Biden said at the West Side Rail Yard in New York City Tuesday, promoting a project made possible by the infrastructure measure.

""When the project is complete, trains will be in and out of New York more quickly, more safely, with fewer interruptions,"" Biden said.

MIGRANTS REMAIN CAMPED IN NYC STREET AFTER NEARLY 48 HOURS TO PROTEST EVICTION FROM FREE STAY AT LUXURY HOTEL

The illegal immigrants, who traveled to the Big Apple from the souther border, were initially given taxpayer-funded rooms at the Watson Hotel in Midtown Manhattan. Upon relocation to a new migrant relief center , migrants pushed back and refused to leave the luxury building for several days.

On Tuesday morning, the NYPD removed tents lining the street in an effort to clear the sidewalks, but the migrants remained in place, according to several local news reports.

Biden also did not say whether he would assist Mayor Eric Adams with the protests unfolding outside the Hell's Kitchen hotel, despite the mayor's attempts to gain federal support to help manage the city's crisis.

""The facilities at Brooklyn Cruise Terminal will provide the same services as every other humanitarian relief center in the city, and the scheduled relocations to Brooklyn Cruise Terminal this weekend took place as planned,"" Adams said in a statement provided to Fox News Digital. ""We remain in serious need of support from both our state and federal governments.""

After thousands of migrants were bussed to his city from the southern border, Adams visited El Paso, Texas, in January and declared the situation a ""national crisis.""

Biden visited the border for the first time since taking office in 2021, but has remained detached from the ongoing crisis affecting cities nationally.

Migrants and advocates are reportedly coming together for a planned protest outside the Watson Hotel Tuesday ""to demand NYC show compassion and stop moves to Brooklyn Cruise Terminal in Red Hook.""

NYC HOTEL WORKER CALLS OUT CITY AS MIGRANTS ‘DESTROY’ ROOMS, ‘DISRESPECT’ EMPLOYEES: ‘NO ACCOUNTABILITY’

The Brooklyn Cruise Terminal Humanitarian Emergency Response and Relief Center, which was intended for single adult male migrants, was scheduled to open after Adams said NYC had reached ""its breaking point.""

The Democratic mayor assured that the new facility provides a comfortable space after several migrants who went there immediately turned around and went back to the hotel, citing a lack of bathroom space and heat.

Biden missing in action as Iranians protest regime and declare 'America is not the enemy',"Protests against the legitimacy of Iran’s Islamic Republic continue to sweep across the vast country triggered by a multitude of reasons including rising food prices, the collapse of a twin-tower apartment building killing at least 29 people (with more dead feared under the rubble) and a considerable loathing of the clerical regime.

As the protests continue to intensify and spread, U.S. President Joe Biden has stayed on the sidelines and not personally weighed in on the revolts against the clerical regime.

During Thursday night’s protests in the southwestern city of Abadan, where the building had collapsed, people chanted slogans against Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei himself, saying ""Khamenei is a murderer; his rule is illegitimate,"" despite the deployment of riot police.

Police fired tear gas into the air to disperse the angry crowd of hundreds near the building site, online video analyzed Saturday shows. Videos shared online showed a massive crowd near the Metropol Building on Friday night, with lights shining on its facade. In a second video, demonstrators at street level are seen chanting: ""Our enemy is here; they lie that it is America!"" A third video showed an angry crowd with one shot heard. The person filming turned and ran, shouting: ""Don't shoot! Don't shoot!""

IRAN DISPERSES CROWD ANGRY OVER BUILDING COLLAPSE KILLING 29

According to human rights activists and Iranians meticulously documenting the regime’s violent crackdown, at least five people have been killed and scores of demonstrators have been incarcerated.

The prominent Iran expert Alireza Nader posted video footage showing demonstrators in the city of Bushehr, located on the Persian Gulf, also declaring: ""Our enemy is right here [in Iran], they lie and say it’s America.""

The chant ""Death to the Dictator!"" was also voiced, referring to Khamenei.

The shocking deaths in Abadan prompted Iranian actress Zar Amir Ebrahimi to devote part of her acceptance speech to the suffering victims after winning best actress at the Cannes Film Festival in France on Saturday. Amir Ebrahimi lives in exile due to a smear campaign regarding her romantic life.

""The Biden administration and EU continue to talk about social justice but that just seems to be cheap talk for votes,"" Banafsheh Zand, an Iranian-American journalist and human rights expert, told Fox News Digital. ""That social justice does not seem to extend to everyone around the world though.""

ISRAEL CHEERS REPORT SAYING IRAN TERROR GROUP TO REMAIN ON US BLACKLIST

""That Biden did not even address the disaster in Iran and the huge anti-regime demonstrations, is another sign of him wanting to cover up the Khomeinist regimes’ crimes against humanity, just so he can make his disastrous [nuclear] deal,"" she added. ""The Iranian people, for the most part, now consider both the Democratic Party and the European leaders as hypocrites and foes.""

Lisa Daftari, also an Iran expert, wrote on her website, The Foreign Desk, ""As protests enter their third week in provinces across Iran with demonstrators calling for the death of the Iranian supreme leader and the overthrow of the hard-line, radical regime, the Iranian opposition is coming to social media in droves expressing their frustration at being generally ignored and unsupported by the international community.""

IRAN PROTESTS CONTINUE INTO SECOND WEEK AS STATE DEPARTMENT TWEETS MESSAGE OF SUPPORT FOR PROTESTERS

She continued, ""The protesters, whose platform is mainly centered upon the government’s corruption and lack of human rights, have a global message; they’re calling out the regime spending billions of dollars on its terror ambitions and leaving the Iranian people without subsidies to purchase basic goods and live comfortable lives.""

The United States government—both under Democratic and Republican administrations—has recognized Iran’s regime as the world’s worst state sponsor of terrorism.

Daftari, who speaks fluent Farsi, quoted one anti-regime activist saying: ""I just want the international community to place themselves in our situation, and explain how they would feel. If your entire life is ruined because of a bunch of terrorists and others don’t care about you, how would you feel?""

The lack of strong condemnation of the Iranian regime's violent crackdown on dissent and of solidarity for the protesters from the international community has, according to Daftari, ""to do with the desire of major Western countries to negotiate and revive the 2015 nuclear agreement with Tehran.""

IRAN PROTESTS BREAK OUT ACROSS THE COUNTRY AMID SKYROCKETING FOOD PRICES

The US, France, Britain, Russia, China and Germany are desperately trying to reach a deal with Iran’s regime in Vienna to provide economic sanctions relief in exchange for Tehran promising to temporarily restrict its production of nuclear weapons.

Len Khodorkovsky, a former deputy assistant secretary of state in the Trump administration and senior adviser to the U.S. representative for Iran, tweeted, ""I know what President Trump said to the Iranian people during #IranProtests. President Biden, your turn.""

Khodorkovsky embedded a tweet from Donald Trump from 2020 in which the former president declared that he stands with the people of Iran and added: ""We are following your protests closely. Your courage is inspiring.""

On May 16, U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price tweeted, ""Brave Iranian protesters are standing up for their rights. The Iranian people have a right to hold their government accountable. We support their rights to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression online and offline − without fear of violence and reprisal.""

"Bulgarians protest during US Defense Sec. Austin's visit, PM says no Ukraine military aid","Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin was confronted by protestors in Bulgaria Saturday as he met with Prime Minister Kiril Petkov to discuss the ongoing security crisis with Russia’s war in Ukraine.

Demonstrators appeared to protest any military assistance for Ukraine as they held up Bulgarian and Russian flags as Austin and Petkov met for a joint press conference.

RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES

Top players in the 30-member NATO alliance, like the U.S., U.K., France, Canada and 17 other European nations, have provided military aid to Ukraine and have encouraged other allies to follow suit.

But Bulgaria on Saturday again refused to engage in discussions of sending defensive arms to Kyiv.

""I'd like to say very clearly that we have not discussed any military assistance to Ukraine,"" he said, noting that reports stating otherwise were ""fake news.""

""We are working together to reinforce the eastern flank of NATO, but nothing more than that has been discussed,"" he added.

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said that in the face of Russia’s aggression in Europe, the alliance needed to re-evaluate its force posture and build up its security defenses.

RUSSIA CLAIMS IT USED HYPERSONIC MISSILE TO STRIKE UKRAINE MUNITIONS WAREHOUSE

Stoltenberg said the move should deter any consideration by Russian President Vladimir Putin of extending his war outside the borders of Ukraine, and reaffirmed that an attack on any NATO nation will trigger a response from the entire alliance.

Austin did not comment on Bulgaria’s refusal to send aid to Ukraine as it continues to be pummeled by Russian forces but instead applauded the resilience of the Ukrainian forces.

""Russia's aggression has galvanized the Ukrainian people, NATO and the free world,"" the defense secretary said. ""Their struggle is crucial for the rules-based international order and for the common values that Bulgaria and the United States share.""

DeSantis says Chinese people 'right' to protest 'zero COVID' lockdowns that belong in 'ash heap of history',"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis slammed China's ""zero COVID"" policy on Tuesday and said the people of China are ""right"" to speak out and protest against government lockdowns and abuses of human rights perpetrated by the Chinese Communist Party.

Speaking at a press conference, the Republican governor said China's policies are ""draconian,"" ""unscientific"" and ""violates people's liberties.""

""This CCP has a maniacal desire to exert total control over its population,"" DeSantis said, calling ""zero COVID"" a ""pretext"" for the Chinese government to tyrannize the people. ""I just think we need these draconian COVID policies to go to the ash heap of history where they belong.""

Chinese authorities have initiated a massive law enforcement response to violent protests that began last week and continued to intensify throughout the weekend across China, largely at least temporarily restoring order in the major cities of Beijing and Shanghai as of Tuesday.

CHINESE POLICE GET VIOLENT AS COVID-19 LOCKDOWN PROTESTS SWEEP ACROSS THE COUNTRY

The protests originated after an apartment complex fire in the far-west region of the country resulted in the deaths of 10 people, an event that has been blamed on a delayed response by the local fire department amid continued lockdown policies.

Protesters took to the streets across the country to demand pandemic restrictions be eased, while others even called for the resignation of the country's top leaders. Violent confrontations between police and protesters were filmed and have been posted online.

President Biden's administration has issued limited comments on the unrest in China, saying, ""the White House supports the right of peaceful protest.""

CHINA PROTESTS GARNER MUTED REACTIONS FROM WORLD LEADERS, UN

DeSantis, widely seen as a prospective 2024 presidential candidate, also commented on reports that Apple restricted the ability of Chinese iPhone users to use its AirDrop file-sharing service, which is a tool that has been used to bypass censorship and spread information about protests.

The governor accused Apple of ""providing aid and comfort"" to the CCP and criticized the company for ""threatening to remove Twitter from the app store because Elon Musk is actually opening it up for free speech.""

""That would be a huge, huge mistake, and it would be a really raw exercise of monopolistic power that I think would merit a response from the United States Congress,"" DeSantis said.

"DOJ allowing illegal protests outside SCOTUS justices' homes despite federal law, former officials say","The Department of Justice has failed to enforce a federal statute which prohibits protests, pickets, and other forms of intimidation outside the home of judges.

It is illegal under federal law to attempt to influence a judge's ruling or interfere with the discharge of their duty. However, the Department of Justice has thus far refused to interfere with demonstrators outside the homes of several Supreme Court justices, including Justices Clarence Thomas, Amy Coney Barrett, and Brett Kavanaugh. While the DOJ has provided security at the justices' homes, they have allowed protests and picketing to continue unimpeded.

John Daukas, retired Acting Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, told Fox News that the ongoing pressure from activists for an as-of-yet unreleased decision is a clear violation of federal law.

""It certainly is illegal,"" Daukas told Fox News Digital. ""And it is right there in the sweet spot of the statute.""

AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION SAYS LIMITING ABORTION ACCESS IS 'VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS'

According to 18 U.S. Code § 1507: ""Whoever, with the intent of interfering with, obstructing, or impeding the administration of justice, or with the intent of influencing any judge, juror, witness, or court officer, in the discharge of his duty, pickets or parades in or near a building housing a court of the United States, or in or near a building or residence occupied or used by such judge, juror, witness, or court officer, or with such intent uses any sound-truck or similar device or resorts to any other demonstration in or near any such building or residence, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.""

The statute, Daukas says, ""is designed exactly to prevent people from intimidating, harassing, or influencing any judge.""

FAITH LEADERS DEMAND DOJ RESPONSE TO 'TROUBLING' ATTACKS ON PREGNANCY CENTERS

The 1507 statute was put into law on Sept. 23, 1950 to curb public intimidation of judges ruling on the legality of Jim Crow laws. The federal government at the time aimed to curb influence on judicial review of laws implemented during reconstruction.

""The judiciary is supposed to ignore public sentiment and public opinion and follow the law and do what the law says,"" Daukas told Fox News Digital. ""And that's their job. And that's why it's not okay to intimidate judges or harass judges. In other words, there is no reason — there's no legitimate reason — to try to influence a judge by picketing and so forth, because the judge is not supposed to listen to that kind of thing.""

Daukas went on to speculate that a matter this important and in the public eye would be handled by at least the attorney general, if not cross the desk of the president.

""I've worked with many, many, really terrific, wonderful people at the Department of Justice who were dedicated civil servants. And there are a tremendous number of great people there. But, you know, policy starts from the top here. And I think this is all coming from the White House and then down to the attorney general, who's the one who sets the policy and the priorities.""

PRO-CHOICE PROTESTORS DESCEND ON CONEY BARRETT'S HOME WITH BLOOD AND DOLL PROPS

Another former high-ranking Department of Justice official who agreed to speak on background told Fox News Digital that the DOJ must explain why it has failed to enforce the statute.

""I certainly haven't seen any action by the attorney general or the Justice Department or the president to do anything about any of this. I just find that appalling,"" the former official said. ""When you have these pro-abortion groups publicizing home addresses and schools and houses of worship and organizing protests at the houses of Supreme Court justices — some of these people including Justices Barrett and Kavanaugh have young children. And the Justice Department is doing nothing — at least nothing visible — about it. That raises very serious questions about why and what the department is trying to accomplish here.""

He added, ""Maybe there's something in the works, I don't know, but it would be wholly appropriate for the attorney general and the president to speak against this conduct publicly. They don't have to reveal internal deliberative processes about possible indictments.""

The DOJ refused to comment on the statute when contacted by Fox News Digital. Instead, a spokesperson for the department pointed to previous comments from Attorney General Merrick Garland, who has only briefly acknowledged the situation.

In a press conference last week, Garland said, ""The Justice Department takes extraordinarily seriously any violence, any criminal threats of violence, intimation, harassment, of the Justices or of any government officials. For that reason, we swiftly moved to provide 24/7 protection for the Justices, including of their residences. For that reason, I called a meeting with the Marshal of the Supreme Court, with the Director of the Marshals Service, with the Deputy Director of the FBI, and with our prosecutors right from the very beginning, to be sure that we were assessing all possible threats and providing all resources available.""

'RUTH SENT US' GROUP HINTED AT TARGETING SUPREME COURT JUSTICE BARRETT'S CHILDREN, CHURCH

Garland went on to pledge support for legislation currently moving through Congress to provide additional security and safety for justices in the future.

""I also met with the Judges – Judge Salas and Judge Sullivan – of the Judicial Conference Committee on Judicial Security and pledged our full support as well as our support for the legislation that they are seeking. There is currently legislation passing through Congress and the Justice Department is extremely supportive of that security legislation.""

Pro-choice group Ruth Sent Us hinted at targeting protests at Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett after the attempted attack on Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Ruth Sent Us specifically noted the Barrett family's daily schedule and the school her children attend.

However, the safety of Supreme Court justices is not the only issue faced by the DOJ. The department has also been in hot water for a perceived lack of enforcement regarding vandalism and destruction of pro-life pregnancy centers and houses of worship.

The pro-choice group ""Jane’s Revenge"" has recently taken credit for attacks on pro-life organizations, including for the attack on Wisconsin Family Action last month and throwing red paint on a crisis pregnancy center in Washington, D.C. last week.

CatholicVote published a letter Friday, addressed to Attorney General Merrick Garland, demanding action on a string of violent and destructive crimes against pro-life pregnancy centers in the U.S. The letter, co-signed by over a dozen political organizations, expressed serious concern for the well-being of pro-life activists in the face of recurring violence following the leak of a Supreme Court draft decision which would overturn Roe v. Wade.

""One extremist group is advocating for violence in response to the final Supreme Court decision on Dobbs, while another group has published home addresses, and encouraged people to show up at Supreme Court Justices’ homes, churches, and their children’s schools in an attempt to coerce the Justices and influence their final decision,"" the letter reads.

The letter – sent to the Attorney General's Office by CatholicVote – was cosigned by other heavyweight activist organizations, including the United Nations Human Rights Commission, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, and the Heritage Foundation.

Ben Sasse poses 'threat' as president","College students organized a protest in response to their university’s nomination of a sole finalist for president of the school. The University of Florida announced on October 6 that Senator Ben Sasse, R-Neb, was unanimously nominated to be the only contender to serve as the 13th president of the public institution.



Sasse, who has served the state of Nebraska since 2015, is expected to resign his Senate seat in December and start his new job at the university in February, should the nomination go through.

SASSE EXPECTED TO RESIGN SENATE SEAT, LIKELY TO BE NEXT UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA PRESIDENT



He was on campus on October 10 for multiple public forums with students, faculty, and staff. Sasse spoke at Emerson Alumni Hall at 2:30 PM during a Q&A session for students. Students were given the opportunity to submit questions before the event.



Several student organizations gathered outside the building to protest the nomination, including the UF Young Democratic Socialists of America, UF Graduate Assistants United,UF Communists and UF College Democrats.



Students expressed their concerns with Fox News Digital.



""Ben Sasse is on the record anti-gay marriage, anti-transgender people and anti-abortion. He poses a threat to all students that may be queer or non-men,"" one student said. ""I'm worried that it might be even harder for students to get an abortion.""



Another student said ""his views are very right-wing, really far right,"" adding that he is ""not a high character individual.""



""I think that he lacks the experience to lead a university as big and prestigious as the University of Florida,"" one student said.



Other students said his stances on climate change and the overturning of Roe v. Wade concerned them, as well as his ability to ""unite"" the university population.



The protest started outside, but students gradually made their way inside the building and stood outside the room where Sasse was speaking. Their chants of ""Ben Sasse has got to go"" could be heard from inside the room.

AS GOP RALLIES BEHIND HERSCHEL WALKER, BACKERS SAY ABORTION ALLEGATION DOESN'T MATTER



Students said their school spirit would decrease if Sasse were to become president of the university.



One student told Fox News Digital, ""If this goes through, I'm not going to be proud to be a Gator. And I'm worried that this might affect our rankings.""



Another student said she has been ""embarrassed to be a Florida Gator"" because ""it's been clear for a while now that Governor DeSantis and the Florida legislature want to destroy public education.""



After Sasse finished speaking and exited the space, students swarmed the empty room and stood up on the stage continuing their chants. Leaders of the event said they wanted to ""make his life miserable."" At one point, a student called him a ""homophobic piece of sh**.""



Students argued the campus dynamic would change if Sasse were to become president.



""I worry very much about the most marginalized on campus and whether or not they'll feel like UF is still a safe space for them.""



Another student echoed the same concerns.



""I feel that a lot of marginalized groups on campus will feel less safe and less secure,"" she said.



However, one student admitted he was ""able to be won over"" saying he was at the event ""to see what he has to say.""



Shortly after the event, UF Graduate Assistants United tweeted a video of what appears to be Sasse leaving the building via a police car.



The organization tweeted, ""This is what a coward looks like. This will be your life every day if you accept a position here.""

Sasse voted to impeach former president Donald Trump during his second impeachment trial in 2021. Prior to serving in the Senate, Sasse spent five years as president of Midland University and taught at the University of Texas at Austin.



According to statement released by the University of Florida, ""the Committee’s recommendation will now go before the University of Florida Board of Trustees for its consideration at a meeting scheduled for November 1, 2022.""

"GoFundMe, now nixing Canadian trucker fundraiser, promoted Capitol Hill Occupied Protest appeal","Crowdfunding platform GoFundMe, which is now caught up in controversy over its nixing of a fundraiser for the Canadian trucker protests, once promoted an appeal for the 2020 Seattle Capitol Hill Occupied Protest (CHOP.)

The platform on Friday announced that it had frozen the convoy’s official campaign, offering a justification that there was violence connected to the Freedom Convoy and the protest had turned into an occupation. The truckers are protesting Canada's vaccine mandates.

GOFUNDME BACKTRACKS ON REDISTRIBUTING MONEY FOR CANADIAN TRUCKERS, UNDER THREAT OF FRAUD INVESTIGATION

""We now have evidence from law enforcement that the previously peaceful demonstration has become an occupation, with police reports of violence and other unlawful activity,"" a statement from GoFundMe said.

It said it had subsequently judged the fundraiser to be in violation of its terms of service (specifically clauses barring the promotion of violence and harassment) and that it was being removed. It subsequently reversed a decision to redistribute any funds that had not been claimed.

The GoFundMe page to support the ""Freedom Convoy"" of Canadian truckers was approaching $10 million as of Monday evening, which is more money than the major federal political parties of Canada raised during the last quarter of 2021.

However, despite its concern about ""occupation,"" in 2020 the platform not only allowed, but also gave its backing on social media to a fundraiser for a farmer working in the left-wing Seattle protest which occupied a six-block downtown area.

""In a community with no police, this farmer is feeding people & bringing them closer together,"" the tweet said with a link to the fundraiser. ""Learn how you can support Marcus' mission within the CHOP""

The platform retweeted a Bloomberg interview with the farmer, in which he said it was interesting to him to see ""an area that has been highly gentrified taken over and occupied and for these people to experience what it’s like to be occupied and to deal with issues of being displaced.""

NYT DESTROYS LIBERAL NARRATIVE OF SEATTLE'S ‘AUTONOMOUS ZONE,’ DESCRIBES ‘HARROWING’ SCENE FOR BUSINESSES

While the CHOP was initially heralded by liberal media outlets and politicians, the New York Times later reported on the experience of besieged business owners who endured the occupation and violence that accompanied it.

""Business crashed as the Seattle police refused to respond to calls to the area. Officers did not retake the region until July 1, after four shootings, including two fatal ones,"" the Times reported.

Fox News reported at the time that crimes including shooting and assaults had taken place, that protesters had reportedly blocked police from responding to crimes and that the local police chief had said that 911 response times to reports of burglaries, rapes and other crimes had tripled in the vicinity.

The contrast between GoFundMe’s backing of CHOP and its nixing of the Freedom Convoy fundraiser was noted by commentators including Tesla CEO Elon Musk.

""Double-standard?"" he tweeted on Friday.

House Democratic leader's non-binary child arrested in anti-cop protest had 'climate change' nightmares,"House Democratic Whip Katherine Clark's non-binary child, who was arrested in an anti-cop protest over the weekend, was the one the Massachusetts congresswoman previously said had nightmares about ""climate change.""

Clark’s middle child, Riley Dowell, was arrested Saturday evening for allegedly tagging a monument with anti-police slogans in spray paint and assaulting a law enforcement officer during the protest.

The House Democratic whip in December recalled Dowell ""waking up with nightmares"" over climate change.

HOUSE DEMOCRAT LEADER’S DAUGHTER ARRESTED FOR ALLEGEDLY ASSAULTING POLICE OFFICER, SPRAY-PAINTING MONUMENT

""One of the biggest changes is going to be that we're coming into this in the minority, but the commitment that we have had to the people of this country, to workers, to women, to the climate is going to continue on,"" Clark said.

""And let me tell you what it means to me coming in as a different generation,"" she continued. ""I remember my middle child waking up with nightmares over concern around climate change. I've had my family at a movie theater, when the movie stopped, my children immediately felt there must be a shooter in the theater with us.""

""These are the type of experiences that we are going to bring as we continue to push to meet this moment of challenge for the American people with progress,"" she added.

INCOMING DEM WHIP CLARK RECALLS CHILD ‘WAKING UP WITH NIGHTMARES’ OVER CLIMATE CHANGE

Dowell, 23, was arrested and charged with assault with a dangerous weapon, destruction or injury of personal property, and damage of property by graffiti.

The Boston Police Department referred to the suspect as ""Jared Dowell."" Clark has spoken in the past about how one of her children is non-binary.

Officers were called to the Parkman Bandstand Monument in the Boston Common around 9:30 p.m. Saturday about a protest.

When officers arrived, they saw Dowell allegedly spray-painting ""ACAB,"" which stands for ""All Cops Are Bastards,"" and ""NO COP CITY,"" an apparent reference to a police training facility in the suburbs of Atlanta that has sparked protests after officers shot and killed a protester who allegedly opened fire on them, injuring one, earlier this week.

While police arrested Dowell, a group of 20 protesters ""began to surround officers while screaming profanities though megaphones on the public street causing traffic to come to a standstill,"" according to police.

The protesters were ""interfering with the arrest"" and ""an officer was hit in the face and could be seen bleeding from the nose and mouth.""

Clark addressed the arrest in a tweet posted Sunday.

""I love Riley, and this is a very difficult time in the cycle of joy and pain in parenting,"" Clark tweeted. ""This will be evaluated by the legal system, and I am confident in that process.""

Dowell will be arraigned in Boston Municipal Court.

Interior secretary's daughter member of group that participated in violent protest at Interior headquarters,"Interior Secretary Deb Haaland's daughter belongs to a grassroots environmental group that participated in a violent protest at the Department of the Interior (DOI) headquarters in late 2021.

The top Biden official's daughter Somah Haaland is a media organizer for the New Mexico-based Pueblo Action Alliance which has repeatedly called on the federal government to take drastic measures halting oil and gas development on public lands. According to government watchdog Protect the Public’s Trust (PPT), members from the group attended the October 2021 protest which led to multiple injuries among DOI security personnel and at least one hospitalization.

""With the connections of members of DOI leadership to groups many consider on the radical fringes of the environmental movement, it’s not surprising the Department might consider such organizations to be their friends and attempt to downplay the potential for situations to get out of hand,"" said PPT Director Michael Chamberlain.

""But the circumstances around the riot at Interior headquarters represent yet another instance in which an administration that promised a return to normalcy is producing anything but,"" he added. ""Meanwhile, the American public’s trust in its government continues its precipitous decline.""

BIDEN CABINET MEMBER'S DAUGHTER LOBBYING CONGRESS ON ISSUE HER MOM HAS FINAL SAY ON: 'CONFLICT OF INTEREST'

The violent protest at the Stewart Lee Udall building, the DOI headquarters, took place on Oct. 14, 2021, during a week in which climate activists had planned several rallies calling on the Biden administration to implement aggressive actions to combat global warming. During the protest, activists attempted to infiltrate the DOI building leading to several injuries among security personnel and one officer being transported to a nearby hospital for treatment.

BIDEN ADMIN SIDES AGAINST NATIVE AMERICANS IN CRACKDOWN ON OIL LEASING NEAR INDIGENOUS SITE

In a statement following the violent protest, a DOI spokesperson downplayed the situation, saying the agency ""believes strongly in respecting and upholding the right to free speech and peaceful protest"" and would continue ""to do everything we can to deescalate the situation while honoring first amendment rights.""

While Interior officials also expressed shock at the protest, internal agency communications obtained this week by PPT showed that officials from the DOI, Department of Homeland Security, National Park Service and Metropolitan Police Department coordinated security efforts ahead of the protest which activists said would include ""civil disobedience"" measures.

For example, in one message, U.S. Park Police told DOI security officials that they should be ""bit more vigilant"" ahead of the protest.

NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES DEPENDENT ON FOSSIL FUEL RESOURCES RIP BIDEN ADMIN FOR DOUBLE STANDARD

And DOI Director of Intergovernmental and External Affairs Shantha Ready-Alonso met with protest leaders who gave her a flash drive one day before the protest. Ready-Alonso had been invited to attend a press conference outside the DOI building organized by environmental groups, but the event was canceled over security concerns, the internal communications showed.

Speakers from the Greater Chaco Coalition, a group that includes Somah Haaland's Pueblo Action Alliance, was one of the lead event organizers.

Meanwhile, in December, Somah Haaland was one of several activists to travel to Capitol Hill to lobby lawmakers to support a federal moratorium on oil and gas leasing near a Native American historical site in New Mexico. She and the other activists argued that drilling near the Chaco Culture National Historical Park in northwestern New Mexico would cause irreparable damage to local communities and the environment.

However, her involvement in the lobbying push sparked concerns that there was a conflict of interest since her mother would have the final say in a decision on the moratorium. Activists have called for a moratorium halting drilling within 10 miles of the site while industry groups and locals have supported five-mile compromise.

""In our comments on the withdrawal, we pointed out the conflict of interest Secretary Haaland already has as a member of a Puebloan nation that is advocating for the 10-mile buffer,"" Kathleen Sgamma, the president of the Western Energy Alliance, told Fox News Digital in December. ""Her daughter actively lobbying for the buffer highlights the conflict of interest and lack of discretion.""

Sgamma added that it appeared ""Secretary Haaland’s interests and kinship ties are clouding her ability to make a reasoned, balanced decision.""

"Julian Assange supporters protest against US extradition in London, DC: 'crucial that we fight'","Hundreds of supporters of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange gathered in London and Washington, D.C., on Saturday to demand the U.S. government end its efforts to extradite him over the publication of classified documents.

Assange, who is currently being held at London’s high-security Belmarsh Prison, will face espionage charges if he is extradited to the U.S. He is accused of publishing information detailing crimes committed by the U.S. government in the Guantánamo Bay detention camp, Iraq and Afghanistan, and reveals instances in which the CIA engaged in torture and rendition.

Britain's High Court ruled over the summer that Assange can be extradited to the U.S.

Supporters in London on Saturday formed a human chain outside Britain's parliament that stretched from its perimeter railings and across nearby Westminster Bridge to the other side of the River Thames.

JULIAN ASSANGE EXTRADITION TO US APPROVED BY BRITISH GOVERNMENT

Assange's wife Stella said the British government should speak to U.S authorities to stop the extradition attempts.

""It's already gone on for three and a half years. It is a stain on the United Kingdom and is a stain on the Biden administration,"" she said.

In the U.S., supporters of the Australian-born activist gathered outside the Justice Department to call on the federal government to drop its extradition bid. The protestors said they hope Assange never steps foot on U.S. soil and that he would not be treated fairly by the judicial system.

""Julian wasn't trying to help dictatorships, he was trying to stop the United States from becoming one! And that's why they want him in jail, and that is why it is crucial that we fight to set Julian free,"" 2020 Libertarian Vice Presidential candidate Spike Cohen said at the rally.

Human trafficking survivor Eliza Bleu urged the ""global elites, the ruling class"" and employees of the CIA and FBI to ""be a hero, quit your job and become a whistleblower.""

""If it's a choice between free speech and the United States government, trust and know, one's gotta go! If one has to go, it ain't gonna be free speech!"" she said, adding that she is so passionate about freedom because she knows what it is like to lose it.

EXTRADITION OF WIKILEAKS FOUNDER JULIAN ASSANGE APPROVED BY UK JUDGE

Bleu said that, despite being a female trafficking survivor, she skipped out on the Women's March that also took place on Saturday because, without a free press, there would be nobody to cover women's issues or survivor's issues.

Assange sought asylum at the Ecuadorian embassy in London years ago because he faced extradition to Sweden after two women accused him of rape. The investigations were eventually dropped.

Multiple speakers at the rally in D.C. railed against the corporate press for their lack of journalists at the event, particularly calling out The New York Times and The Guardian for being among the outlets to also publish the contents of the documents Assange had obtained.

""We need watchdog journalists not lapdog journalists,"" two-time Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein said.

In addition to publishing war logs leaked to him by former U.S. Army soldier Chelsea Manning, who was convicted in 2013 of violations of the Espionage Act and other offenses, Assange's site published internal communications taken from the Democratic National Committee and then-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's campaign that shed light on the DNC's attempts to boost Clinton in the 2016 Democratic primary.

Assange has been blamed for impacting Clinton's chances of winning the presidency in 2016.

The Wikileaks founder is wanted by U.S. authorities on 18 counts over the publication of classified documents.

The U.S. has said that Assange put lives in danger with his publication of the documents but his supporters call him a political victim.

The CIA has reportedly previously had plans to kill Assange over the publication of sensitive CIA hacking tools, known as ""Vault 7."" The agency said it suffered ""the largest data loss in CIA history"" after Wikileaks published the materials.

According to a September 2021 Yahoo report, the CIA during the Trump era had discussions ""at the highest levels"" of the administration about plans to assassinate Assange in London. Following orders from then-CIA director Mike Pompeo, the agency had drawn up kill ""sketches"" and ""options."" The report further noted advanced plans to kidnap and rendition Assange and that the CIA made a political decision to charge him.

Migrants remain camped in NYC street after nearly 48 hours to protest eviction from free stay at luxury hotel,"A group of illegal immigrants remain in protest outside the Watson Hotel in New York City, sleeping in the streets for nearly two days to push back against relocation from their taxpayer-funded hotel in Manhattan to a migrant crisis center in Brooklyn.

After entering into the U.S. through the southern border, tens of thousands of migrants were sent to New York City where they were given free housing at luxury hotels, while Mayor Eric Adams prepared a facility to control the influx of migrants pouring into the city.

The city prepared to move migrants, specifically single adult men, from the Watson Hotel in New York City to the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal facility, but faced pushback on Sunday night from the individuals who refused to relocate.

The illegal migrants, who were given free rooms at the $300-per-night Hells Kitchen hotel, refused to vacate when asked to leave and were joined by migrant activists to rally outside the building. As of Tuesday morning, the group of migrants was still camped outside the hotel, according to several local news reports.

ILLEGAL MIGRANTS REFUSE TO LEAVE NYC HOTEL FOR BROOKLYN MIGRANT RELIEF CENTER, SLEEP IN THE STREET

The immigrants remained there overnight, sleeping in tents on the sidewalk of the busy city. The NYPD since cleared out the tents that were blocking the sidewalks, however, the migrants remain posted outside the 3.5 star hotel.

Some individuals left the hotel for the migrant crisis center, but returned after claiming the facility was lacking in heat and water.

Mayor Eric Adams of New York immediately responded to the migrant protest, settling claims that the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal did not meet humane conditions.

JESSE WATTERS: MIGRANTS COME SAYING THEY WANT TO WORK, THEN PROTEST WHEN THEY DON'T GET FREE RENT

""I just had to come here when I started hearing all the rumors that it was too cold, my brother got on shorts. It’s warm inside. About the food not being there, healthy food is present,"" Adams said in a video posted to Twitter Monday.

The Democratic Mayor also released photos of a cafeteria style food assortment reportedly available to the migrants and Adams is seen playing ping pong at one of the tables in the center.

""This weekend, we began the process of moving single adult men from the Watson Hotel to Brooklyn Cruise Terminal, as we transition the hotel to meet the large number of asylum-seeking families with children,"" Adams said in a statement.

""More than 42,000 asylum seekers have arrived in New York City since last spring, and we continue to surpass our moral obligations as we provide asylum seekers with shelter, food, health care, education, and a host of other services,"" the mayor continued.

Pro-abortion groups target churches for Mother's Day protests,"Pro-abortion activists are targeting Catholic churches for protests on Mother's Day, with some citing the Roman Catholic faith of multiple justices who reportedly at one point supported the leaked draft opinion striking down Roe v. Wade.

The protests follow days of organizing in front of the Supreme Court building following the leak Monday night – protests that led the Washington, D.C., police to erect a fence ostensibly to protect the building and justices within. Fox News has also learned that there has been a strong police presence at the justices' homes following the leak.

MASSIVE FENCE ERECTED AROUND SUPREME COURT BUILDING AND JUSTICE CANCELS PUBLIC EVENT AMID PROTESTS

""Whether you’re a ‘Catholic for Choice’, ex-Catholic, of other or no faith, recognize that six extremist Catholics set out to overturn Roe,"" the pro-abortion organizing group Ruth Sent Us posted on Twitter, with a video of activists appearing to disrupt a church service. ""Stand at or in a local Catholic Church Sun May 8.""

The organization Rise Up 4 Abortion Rights has organized a ""week of action"" beginning on May 8, Mother's Day, with ""Actions Outside of Churches.""

""This action is called for by a collective of spanish [sic] speaking women’s rights groups + activists across the country, including from Bride’s March, Dominican Women’s Development Center, Ni Una Menus, and Las 17,"" according to the event schedule. ""Several cities will be hosting protests outside of prominent churches in their towns, these can look like a group of people holding signs wearing Handmaids Tale outfits, passing out flyers outside to church goers or doing a die-in.""

Abortion activists don ""Handmaid's Tale"" outfits in protest, comparing laws restricting abortion to the regime of ritualized rape and forced motherhood in Margaret Atwood's novel.

WHITE HOUSE ENCOURAGES ‘PEACEFUL PROTESTS,' WON'T TELL ABORTION ACTIVISTS TO AVOID SCOTUS JUSTICES' HOMES

Pro-abortion vandals targeted a church in Boulder, Colorado, Wednesday, spray-painting ""bans off our bodies"" and ""my body my choice"" on the building.

Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts confirmed Tuesday that Justice Samuel Alito's draft opinion in the case Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization was genuine – although the draft dates back to February, and it does not represent the current or final opinion of the court. In the draft, Alito strikes down Roe v. Wade, which struck down state laws across the country, and allows states to again make their own laws on abortion.

Following the leak, activists have called for protests at the homes of the justices who will supposedly vote to overturn Roe, and even published their addresses online.

It remains unclear whether the Court will overturn Roe in the Dobbs decision, and which justices will vote in favor of the move. The Politico story reporting the link claimed that five justices had voted to do so, and that Roberts favored upholding the Mississippi abortion law at issue but did not want to overturn Roe.

Brian Burch, president of the Catholic advocacy organization Catholic Vote, condemned the planned protests and urged President Biden – who has faced criticism for claiming a Catholic identity while supporting abortion – to condemn what Burch called ""domestic terrorist threats.""

""In the wake of the shameless leak of a draft opinion of the Supreme Court, pro-abortion groups are now threatening to disrupt Catholic churches and to protest outside the homes of Supreme Court justices this Sunday,"" Burch noted in a statement Thursday.

""President Biden must immediately and forcibly condemn these domestic terrorist threats,"" Burch declared. ""Anti-Catholic zealots are plotting to intimidate and harass Catholics across the country, along with justices and their families. This country was built on freedom of speech and freedom of religion. The President of the United States must stand up for both.""

""These threats follow a record number of attacks on Catholic churches, shrines, and symbols over the past two years,"" the Catholic Vote president added, citing the Boulder vandalism.

Catholic Vote has urged the Department of Justice to investigate the trend of anti-Catholic vandalism, citing at least 120 instances since May 2020.

The White House on Thursday declined to encourage abortion activists to avoid protesting at justices' private residences. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said that Biden ""shares"" the ""concern"" and ""horror"" of those who ""feel outraged"" or ""scared"" over the leaked draft opinion.

When Fox News' Peter Doocy asked Psaki if abortion protests outside justices' houses might be considered extreme, she said, ""Peaceful protest, no. Peaceful protest is not extreme. We certainly encourage people to keep it peaceful and not resort to any level of violence.""

Contrary to Ruth Sent Us, the justices who voted to overturn Roe were not ""six extremist Catholics."" While Justices Alito, Clarence Thomas, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett are Catholic, Neil Gorsuch, the ostensible fifth vote, is Episcopalian. Roberts and Justice Sonia Sotomayor are also Catholic, though they reportedly did not vote to overturn Roe. Justices Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan are Jewish, while incoming Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson is a nondenominational Protestant.

""Keep your rosaries, off my ovaries,"" the protesters could be heard chanting in call and response fashion while police stood on guard in front of Kavanaugh’s home.

26-year-old California man Nicholas John Roske was arrested early Wednesday near Kavanaugh's house in Maryland after threatening to kill the justice. Police said he was carrying a gun, a knife and zip ties.

CNN REPORTER WARNS OF VIOLENCE FROM ‘BOTH SIDES’ AFTER ARMED MAN ARRESTED OUTSIDE JUSTICE KAVANAUGH'S HOME

Later in the day federal prosecutors charged Roske with the attempted murder of a Supreme Court Justice. During a court hearing, he consented to remain in federal custody for now.

Roske told police he was upset by a leaked draft opinion suggesting the Supreme Court is about to overrule Roe v. Wade, the landmark abortion case. He also said he was upset over the school massacre in Uvalde, Texas, and believed Kavanaugh would vote to loosen gun control laws, the affidavit said.

Throughout the day the pro-choice activist group, ""Ruth Sent Us,"" posted a series of tweets trying to distance themselves from ""fundamentalists,"" while also labeling Kavanaugh a ""white supremacist.""

In another post, the group said it offered its ""thoughts & prayers"" to Justice Kavanaugh and his wife, Ashley Kavanaugh.

In yet another, the group shared a screenshot of a Catholic billboard with a piece of paper taped onto it reading: ""Chasing Justice in Chevy Chase,"" featuring the faces of Justices Kavanaugh and John Roberts.

""A special message for Ashley Kavanaugh and your daughters – this billboard was on your school grounds. We feel for you,"" the group tweeted. ""@Leader McConnell and the GOP aren’t worried about your safety. They worry only for the expensive Supreme Court they rigged, and their own power. #SCOTUS.""

In one tweet, the group suggested Roske is a ""good guy with a gun"" because he failed to carry out his alleged plan to assassinate Justice Kavanaugh.

There have been protests at the homes of Kavanaugh and other justices, as well as demonstrations at the court, where a security fence rings the building and nearby streets have been closed.

Protest responding to Massachusetts Democrat's comments about disabled unborn babies announced,"Framingham, Massachusetts, residents are planning to protest after a local Democrat complained about the cost of special education for children with disabilities who are not aborted, according to a local advocate.

""We are coming together on Tuesday to show our support for the community and encourage others to join us in the healing process,"" said Jon Fetherston, a disabilities advocate and former Ashland Selectman who's planning the protest. ""Every life is important, and words matter.""

During a city council meeting earlier this month, Michael Hugo, the chair of the Framingham Democratic Committee, said crisis pregnancy centers could misdiagnose a defect in a baby in the womb, leading to a disabled child not being aborted and becoming a financial strain on a school system. He apologized 10 days later following backlash from irate parents and community members.

""Our fear is that if an unqualified sonographer misdiagnoses a heart defect, an organ defect, spina bifida or an encephalopathic defect that becomes a very local issue because our school budget will have to absorb the cost of a child in special education, supplying lots and lots of special services to children, who were born with the defect,"" Hugo said at the Feb. 7 meeting in question.

MASSACHUSETTS DEMOCRAT TOLD TO STEP DOWN AFTER ABORTION COMMENTS LEAVE PARENTS IRATE

On Feb. 17, in a public statement, Hugo offered his ""most sincere and humble apology.""

""I am writing to offer my most sincere and humble apology to members of the Framingham Democratic Committee, but more especially my fellow members of Framingham's disability family community, for comments that I made at the last City Council meeting which were offensive and hurtful,"" he wrote.

The Framingham Democratic Committee also issued a statement, denouncing Hugo’s statement, claiming it did not reflect the full committee, despite the committee receiving Hugo’s remarks several hours in advance of him delivering them. It also said it ""put in place processes to avoid future occurrences.""

The group ""Ruth Sent Us,"" which is named after late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, had called on abortion supporters to gather outside the homes of the ""six extremist Catholics set out to overturn Roe"" and ""s​​tand at or in a local Catholic Church"" on Mother’s Day.

The group added in a Saturday tweet that protesters will ""be burning the Eucharist to show our disgust for the abuse Catholic Churches have condoned for centuries.""

Liberals and abortion supporters on Sunday denounced calls to not protest outside the homes and at churches, with some warning to ""expect more"" and ""look down the road & visualize what’s ahead.""

Protests have also formed outside of churches. A video filmed outside the Basilica of St. Patrick's Old Cathedral in Manhattan this weekend showed one pro-abortion protester shouting ""I'm killing the babies!"" while waving dolls around near a pro-life group praying.

Congressional Republicans back Canada 'Freedom Convoy' protest: 'Not some fringe minority',"The massive Canadian ""Freedom Convoy"" protest against cross-border vaccine mandates is gaining supporters among U.S. congressional Republicans, who say they back the demonstrators' message against coronavirus restrictions.

""The Freedom Convoy embodies how we should stand up for our values in a democracy: peaceful protest, and, when necessary, peaceful noncompliance,"" Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo., said in statement to Fox News. ""I'm proud to stand with them.""

""The truckers in Canada have done more for freedom than the entire Democrat party the past two years,"" Rep. Dan Bishop, R-N.C., said. ""They are not some ‘fringe minority’ with ‘unacceptable views.’ The American people, and freedom loving people across the globe, are tired of the Left’s tyrannical policies. By standing against vaccine mandates, these truckers are simply standing up for liberty. We are behind them.""

CANADIAN GROUPS COORDINATING DELIVERY OF FUEL, FOOD AND RESOURCES TO TRUCKERS PROTESTING VACCINE MANDATE

The protest began on Jan. 23 when the convoy left Vancouver for Ottawa, Canada's capital, to air grievances against the country's policy of not letting unvaccinated truckers cross the U.S.-Canada border. The convoy reached the capital on Saturday and was joined by thousands of other Canadians protesting the mandates as it blocked traffic around Parliament Hill.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the group a ""fringe minority"" and said it reflected the proliferation of ""disinformation and misinformation online, conspiracy theorists, about microchips, about God knows what else that go with the tinfoil hats.""

But the protesters and their backers argue Trudeau and other leaders worldwide – including in the U.S. – are abusing government authority with heavy-handed vaccine mandates.

""Canadian truckers love freedom. Where are most Americans? #EndVaxMandates,"" Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, said in a tweet.

""Throughout the last two years, while so many had the luxury of working from home, our truckers never slowed down,"" Buck added. ""They were in their cabs on the road, making sure our families had food on the table and society kept moving. Now, it’s our turn to have their backs and keep them moving while saying ‘no’ to liberal, government-imposed mandates.""

Ottawa police also said they're investigating three complaints through their Hate and Bias Crime Unit, looking into people who desecrated a war monument, and reported there are fewer demonstrators than when the protest first began.

With snow on the way and the potential for sub-zero temperatures in Ottawa by the end of the week, several Canadian groups are organizing to provide fuel, food and more to the demonstrators.

'Struggling' Chicago residents outraged over Lori Lightfoot's decision to house migrants: 'Help my own first',"Residents in a Chicago neighborhood are protesting the city's plans to establish a migrant shelter inside a closed-down elementary school, sharing that they feel ""blindsided"" by Mayor Lori Lightfoot's decision.

Lightfoot’s administration has for months planned to house migrants at a vacant building formerly home to Wadsworth Elementary School, 6420 S. University Ave. in Woodlawn.

A group of Woodlawn neighborhood residents gathered Thursday morning to insist that the Chicago government provide resources for locals rather than the migrants.

""The community feels disrespected, they feel as though they were not included, and they need answers today,"" community member Jennifer Maddox told Fox 32.

Those in the Woodlawn neighborhood said the announcement of the migrant shelter came without Chicago officials providing details on the migrant's living arrangement or a timeline.

""I’m here because I am concerned, I live here, and we need to know what the plan is,"" Carlas Prince Gilbert, a Woodlawn business owner told Fox 32.

Residents say they feel like the announcement felt like ""a slap in the face"" and they think there are other more pressing community issues that should be addressed first like the Chicago crime wave, homelessness issues, and the rising cost of living.

""There is a lack of resources in our community, we don’t need anyone else to come in and suck those up. We're tired, Ms. Lightfoot,"" Erica, a resident, told Fox 32.

‘PANDEMIC OF VIOLENCE’: LIGHTFOOT'S RECORD ON CRIME AT THE FOREFRONT OF CHICAGO MAYORAL ELECTION

Now, residents are demanding answers from their government and are asking if the placed migrants will have background checks before they move in and if the city will provide law enforcement on site.

""We’re struggling right now to make Woodlawn an affordable, mixed-income community. While I would love to help immigrants and everybody else, I’d like to help my own first,"" said Jeane Clark

The move-in was initially scheduled for as early as Friday but Taylor's office confirmed the opening of the location has been postponed indefinitely.

Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s office did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital.

Nearly 4,000 migrants have arrived in Chicago since Aug. 31, when Texas Gov. Greg Abbott began bussing them to Democratic-led cities to protest federal immigration policies. Lightfoot previously visited Washington, D.C., and requested support from President Biden to assist her city in handling the surge of migrants.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/struggling-chicago-residents-outraged-lori-lightfoots-decision-house-migrants-help-own-first,N/A
'Trans Lives Matter' protesters occupy Oklahoma State Capitol: ‘This is our house!’,"Hundreds of ""Trans Lives Matter"" protesters gathered at the Oklahoma state Capitol Monday to demonstrate against legislation that would restrict gender transition-related medical care.

Videos showed protesters chanting ""this is our house,"" and ""protect trans kids,"" and holding signs that read, ""Protect trans rights"" and ""My body, my freedom,"" outside the Capitol building and inside the rotunda.

The protest took place during Gov. Kevin Stitt’s State of the State address, in which he called on the legislature to pass a law banning gender transition medical treatment for minors.

""Minors can’t vote, can’t purchase alcohol, can’t purchase cigarettes. We shouldn’t allow a minor to get a permanent gender-altering surgery in Oklahoma,"" the Republican governor said on the House floor, prompting a standing ovation from Republican lawmakers.

""As governor, I will never shy away from calling out right from wrong. I will not be intimidated by partisan interest groups or make decisions based on groupthink.""

The demonstrators were protesting against Senate Bill 129, or the Millstone Act, which would prohibit Oklahoma doctors from providing gender transition procedures or referral services relating to such procedures to individuals younger than 26.

Republican state Sen. David Bullard said he chose the age of 26 due to scientific findings that say the brain does not fully develop and mature until the mid- to late 20s, according to a press release.

The trans rights protesters are also opposing Senate Bill 252, which would prohibit anyone under the age of 18 from receiving gender reassignment surgery.

""If those under the age of 18 don’t have the mental capacity to vote, drink, or smoke, they certainly should not be making irreversible decisions to mutilate and destroy their body,"" Republican state Sen. Nathan Dahm, who introduced the bill, said in a press release. ""In Oklahoma, we are going to protect children from those who would prey on their insecurities for profit.""

Multiple other bills being discussed in the state legislature target drag shows, publicly-funded transition surgeries and other LGBTQ issues.

TRUMP, TARGETING MCCONNELL AND TOP REPUBLICANS, URGES THEM TO 'GET TOUGHER' IN ELECTION FIGHT

Jan. 6 is the day Congress will meet to accept the presidential election results. President-elect Joe Biden won the election, and presidential electors cast their votes last week in the Electoral College.

But Trump and his campaign have disputed the results and launched numerous legal challenges, although nearly all of them have failed. Earlier this month, the Supreme Court shot down a Texas lawsuit trying to nullify millions of votes in key swing states.

Roughly four dozen lawsuits by the Trump campaign and allies to upend the election results over the past six weeks have been tossed out by state and federal judges.

Trump’s legal team has said it intends to continue mounting legal challenges, but experts say there is little chance of success.

On Saturday, Trump linked to a report by Peter Navarro that claims without evidence that the amount of election fraud was sufficient to swing the election.

TRUMP FIRES BACK AT MCCONNELL AFTER SENATOR MAJORITY LEADER RECOGNIZES BIDEN'S VICTORY

Some Trump allies have planned to call for a debate in the House when the election results are received. However, those plans were dealt a blow when Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell asked his Republican colleagues in the Senate not to contest the election results on Jan. 6, when a joint session of Congress formally accepts the count.

McConnell’s move could effectively end any hopes of a last-minute reprieve for the president. A majority of both chambers of Congress (including the Democratic-controlled House) would be needed to upend the election results.

Meanwhile, Trump has been critical of those in his party who have accepted Biden's victory.

After McConnell recognized Biden as president-elect in a Tuesday speech on the floor of the Senate, Trump responded by calling on him and other Republicans to ""get tougher.""

US academics urge Biden to act in response to Iranian protest crackdown,"More than 2,000 academics from hundreds of universities in the U.S. are urging President Joe Biden to act in response to a crackdown by the Iranian regime against protests at the country’s universities, calling on Biden to halt any negotiations with the regime.

""Iran has a rich history of student movements who have been at the forefront of the Iranian people’s struggle for freedom and democracy, both under the dictatorship of the Shah and the current totalitarian theocracy,"" they write. ""Under both regimes, university students have suffered significant casualties when security forces violently crushed their peaceful protests. We are writing to you to take urgent action to prevent such casualties and loss of life this time.""

The signatories on the letter, obtained by Fox News Digital, include more than 425 Iranian-American professors and 10 American Nobel laureates.

Demonstrations erupted in the Islamic republic after the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody. She had been arrested by the Iranian morality police for not wearing a hijab correctly.

IRAN'S ELITE TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY EMERGES AS HUB OF PROTESTS

The Sharif University of Technology has emerged as one of the key hubs for the resultant nationwide protests that have shaken the regime. Authorities have been violently cracking down on the protests since early last month — which drew the condemnation of many in the international world, including President Biden. Crowds across the country have chanted ""Death to Khamenei!"" and ""Death to the dictator!"" referring to Iran's supreme leader.

In a statement, Biden said he was ""gravely concerned"" about the violence by the Iranian authorities.

""For decades, Iran’s regime has denied fundamental freedoms to its people and suppressed the aspirations of successive generations through intimidation, coercion, and violence. The United States stands with Iranian women and all the citizens of Iran who are inspiring the world with their bravery,"" he said.

He also touted efforts his administration is taking to make it easier for Iranians to access the internet, as well as moves to hold Iranian officials accountable for human rights abuses.

But the academics are calling for more, citing reports of hundreds of deaths and disappearances of ""thousands"" of students who have been involved in the uprisings. Security forces have sought to quash dissent, killing at least 270 people and arresting some 14,000, according to rights groups. Demonstrations have continued even as the feared paramilitary Revolutionary Guard has warned young Iranians to stop.

IRANIAN STUDENTS CLASH WITH POLICE AS DEADLY REGIME CRACKDOWN NEARS 20TH DAY

The academics call Biden’s actions ""commendable"" but insufficient.

""We urgently ask that you halt any and all negotiations with the Iranian regime, and prevent any sanctions relief under any pretext, directly or indirectly, until all violators of human rights in Iran are held accountable,"" they say. ""We also ask you to recognize the universally accepted right of the Iranian people to self-defense as they seek to attain sovereignty and self-determination.""

A National Security Council spokesperson told Fox News Digital that the Biden administration, with partners, is ""moving urgently through unilateral actions, multilateral measures, and UN mechanisms to hold Iran accountable for violence against its own population, particularly women and girls.""

They continued ""In the last week, the United States, the European Union, and Canada have sanctioned more Iranian officials for the ongoing crackdown. We have hosted a UN dialogue with the Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights in Iran, welcomed the joint statement by women foreign ministers on events in Iran, and supported Germany’s recalibration of their Iran policy.""

CALLS GROW TO KICK IRAN OUT OF UN BODY DEDICATED TO EQUALITY AND EMPOWERMENT OF WOMEN

Additionally, the spokesman highlighted the administration's call on Thursday to push for ""the immediate expulsion of the Islamic Republic from the UN Commission on the Status of Women (CSW). The U.S. Government will take action to ensure Iran is removed.""

The Biden administration had sought to engage in talks with Iran to re-enter the Iranian nuclear deal, from which the Trump administration had withdrawn. However, those talks have broken down. A top official recently said the U.S. will not ""waste time"" on trying to revive talks with Iran in light of its crackdown on protests and its support of Russia.

""I think people have to understand that we’re not tying our hands because of ... this hope that someday maybe there'll be a deal,"" U.S. envoy for Iran Rob Malley said. ""No, we are taking action.

US intelligence believes China protests will fail to spread: report,"U.S. government does not believe protests in China are widespread or organized enough to truly spread across the country, according to a Wednesday report.

A U.S. government communication obtained by Politico describes the protests as disorganized and leaderless, indicating they would more than likely fizzle out. The information, dated Tuesday, came just days before Chinese leader Xi Jinping ordered police to crack down on the protesters, sending swarms of officers to protest sites.

The communication offers insight into the White House's lackluster reaction to the protests. President Biden faced heavy criticism for saying simply that the U.S. supports the protesters' right to peacefully demonstrate.

""Why is it so hard for this administration to support freedom? Pure cowardice,"" Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas, wrote after White House officials declined to criticize Xi.

Virginia parents protest critical race theory outside Loudoun County School Board meeting,"Parents and community activists gathered outside a Loudoun County School Board meeting on Tuesday to demand ""an end to the racist and divisive ideologies being infused into the government schools.""

Loudoun County has become the nerve center for parental activism in recent years, driving debates over critical race theory that have bled over to the rest of the United States.

""Parents woke up and realized that their school systems, the administrators, the school boards, are more focused on politics than they are doing their jobs,"" Ian Prior, the executive director of Fight For Schools, said at Tuesday's protest.

Loudoun County parents have been credited by many for boosting Republican Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin to victory in last year's election, along with Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares and Lt.

Top NASA scientist arrested (again) in White House protest,"next Image 1 of 2

prev Image 2 of 2

NASA's top climate scientist and government official James Hansen was arrested Wednesday outside the White House -- at least the fourth arrest now for the scientist.

Hansen, a controversial and highly vocal proponent of the argument that man's actions have dramatically affected the planet's climate, is the director of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies -- a position for which he earns a $180,000 taxpayer-paid salary.

'We have reached a fork in the road.' — James Hansen, head of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies

He was arrested alongside actress Daryl Hannah; Adam Werbach, the founder of the Sierra Club; Bill McKibben, founder of 350.org; Julian Bond, former president of the NAACP; and a few dozen eco-activists protesting the planned Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada to the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.

“We have reached a fork in the road,"" Hansen reportedly told a crowd of protesters before his arrest. ""The politicians have to understand we either go down this road of exploiting every fossil fuel we have — tar sands, tar shale, off-shore drilling in the Arctic — but the science tells us we can’t do that without creating a situation ... our children and grandchildren will have no control over,” he said.

As a government employee, Hansen is essentially taking pot shots at his own employer. Yet a NASA spokesman told FoxNews.com after a 2011 arrest that what Hansen does in his own time is none of the government’s business.

""The agency doesn't comment on personnel matters,"" Ed Campion, a spokesman for parent organization Goddard Space Flight Center, told FoxNews.com.

“We really shouldn’t have to be put in handcuffs to stop KXL,” said 350.org founder Bill McKibben on Wednesday. “But given the amount of money on the other side, we’ve had to spend our bodies, and we’ll probably have to spend them again.”

In a May, 2012 essay for the New York Times, Hansen explained his decision to join the Tar Sands Action protest group, claiming that by burning the oil trapped in tar sand in Canada, the U.S. would be put dangerously at risk from climate change.

“The Western United States and the semi-arid region from North Dakota to Texas will develop semi-permanent drought … economic losses would be incalculable. More and more of the Midwest would be a dust bowl. California’s Central Valley could no longer be irrigated. Food prices would rise to unprecedented levels.”

Hansen has been arrested at least three times before in protests over climate issues, in 2009, 2010, and 2011.",https://www.foxnews.com/science/top-nasa-scientist-arrested-again-in-white-house-protest,N/A

""Obviously, we can be more empathetic and give grace to one another, regardless of race,"" Prescott said. ""From the times we’ve come from to where we are now, thinking about the growth we’ve had. That’s who I am, how I think, optimistic. I mean [as] a guy who is completely biracial, Black and White, it’s easy for me to speak on race on one side or another. … I don't know if I've fully processed it all the way, honestly.""

""In the same sense, it’s 65 years ago and how times have changed,"" he continued. ""I mean, look at the man’s resume since then, right? As I said, I give grace. I think that’s a conversation and question not only for him but for you guys and how you all feel and how accountable you all have been in covering and discussing the disparities and differences in race.""

""As I said, I’m here for growth and giving grace and trying to make this world a better place,"" Prescott added. ""That’s who I am at my core and what I believe in. Unfortunately, things come up from the past, pictures, and they show how far we’ve come, but at the same sense, they’re a reminder of how short of a time that was ago. That wasn’t that long ago that we were all sitting on different sides, and we weren’t together. But as I said, I wouldn’t be here if it were still that way. So, I believe in grace and change. Those are questions for Jerry for you all, honestly, that I don’t have quite the answers for.""

Furious Manchester United fans protest ownership ahead of Liverpool match,"Thousands of Manchester United fans angry at the direction of the club under its American owners took part in a protest ahead of the Premier League game against Liverpool on Monday.

The supporters chanted against the Glazer family — ""We want Glazers out"" — and held banners calling for the Americans to sell United as they walked from a nearby pub to the club's storied Old Trafford stadium during the hour before kickoff of one of the biggest matches in English soccer.

Many supporters around the ground were wearing green-and-gold scarves — the colors of the club’s 1878 formation — and some also set off flares. There appeared to be a robust police presence on Sir Matt Busby Way at the entrance to the stadium forecourt.

The players from both teams, including United's Cristiano Ronaldo, arrived at the ground before the protest started.

Discontent has soared following United’s poor start to the season, which has seen the team lose both of its games — 2-1 at home to Brighton and a 4-0 humiliation at Brentford.

The target of the majority of the anger is the Glazer family, which bought United in 2005 with a leveraged takeover that loaded debt onto a club which previously didn’t have any. Critics say the Glazers, who also own the NFL’s Tampa Bay Buccaneers, have failed to invest enough of their own cash in the squad or facilities and have presided over years of failure by England’s biggest team.

Payments on interest, debt and dividends to the Glazers are estimated to have cost United more than 1 billion pounds.

""They are ruining the history, traditions and culture of our great club and (we) will not stand by and watch our club rot away any longer,"" said The 1958, a fans’ group that arranged Monday’s protest.

Dissent toward the ownership, which has simmered since the 2005 takeover, erupted in May last year when a home league game against Liverpool had to be called off after the stadium — empty because of pandemic restrictions — was stormed before the game and thousands more supporters blocked access into Old Trafford. Two police officers were injured in clashes with fans.

That protest was sparked by the club’s involvement in the failed European Super League breakaway that collapsed amid a groundswell of condemnation from fans and the British government.

LIVERPOOL'S DARWIN NÚÑEZ EJECTED AFTER HEAD-BUTT, HIS CRYSTAL PALACE TARGET RECEIVES ONLINE ABUSE

The Glazers pledged to rebuild trust with United fans in the wake of that protest but there has been little evidence of that. Joel Glazer, a co-chairman, met in person with United fans in June 2021 and outlined his intentions to invest heavily in all aspects of the club and strengthen fan representation in the decision-making process.

Last week, Jim Ratcliffe, the majority shareholder of chemical group Ineos and one of Britain’s richest people, expressed an interest in buying United, soon after Elon Musk tweeted — jokingly, as it turned out — that he wanted to do the same.

United won the last of its record 20 English league titles in 2013, the year managerial great Alex Ferguson retired. In recent years, two of United’s biggest rivals, Manchester City and Liverpool, have dominated the domestic game.

United hasn’t won a major trophy in five seasons, its worst run since the early 1980s, despite the club having spent $1.5 billion on players since 2013.

United's latest signing, Brazil midfielder Casemiro, arrived at Old Trafford earlier Monday ahead of the Liverpool match and was introduced to fans on the field before kickoff as his transfer was being confirmed by the club. He is reportedly costing $60 million, with the club scrambling to bring in players in the final days of the transfer window.

This season has started badly, too, under Erik ten Hag, its fifth manager since Ferguson. There are already question marks over the Dutch coach's tactics and team selection.

Giants’ Gabe Kapler resumes protest day after standing for anthem on Memorial Day,"San Francisco Giants manager Gabe Kapler resumed his protest on Tuesday , choosing to remain in the dugout for the national anthem prior to San Francisco’s game against the Philadelphia Phillies.

Last week, Kapler told reporters that he would not come out for the national anthem until he ""feels better about the direction of our country,"" following the Texas elementary shooting that left 19 students and two teachers dead.

""I don’t plan on coming out for the anthem going forward until I feel better about the direction of our country,"" Kapler told reporters. ""That’ll be the step. I don’t expect it to move the needle necessarily. It’s just something I feel strongly enough about to take that step.""

It was the fourth time in five days that Kapler did not participate during the playing of the national anthem. On Monday — Memorial Day — Kapler paused his protest, choosing to stand for the anthem to honor ""our country’s service men and women who fought and died"" in order to protect the right of protest.

On Tuesday, Giants president of baseball operations Farhan Zaidi, told reporters that he supports Kapler’s decision while saying that the organization will continue to play the national anthem before games.

""As an organization, we stand in lockstep with MLB on the importance of that tradition,"" Zaidi said, according to MLB.com . ""We obviously played the national anthem before all of our home games and will continue to do so. But our organization has also articulated our stance on this before, that our organization respects the rights and choices of Gabe, and all of our players and coaches and fans, to express themselves and their views peacefully in the way that they see fit.""

MLB managers discuss Gabe Kapler national anthem protest after Uvalde shooting,"Several MLB managers are weighing in on the decision by San Francisco Giants manager Gabe Kapler to protest the national anthem following last week's school shooting in Texas.

On Friday, Kapler said he will no longer be attending the playing of ""The Star-Spangled Banner,"" before games, which he clarified in an op-ed, saying he is ""not okay with the state of this country.""

""When I was the same age as the children in Uvalde, my father taught me to stand for the pledge of allegiance when I believed my country was representing its people well or to protest and stay seated when it wasn’t,"" Kapler wrote. ""I don’t believe it is representing us well right now.""

The decision drew a strong response from White Sox manager Tony La Russa who stated that protesting the anthem was an insult to the men and women who died and served in the U.S. military.

""You need to understand what the veterans think when they hear the anthem or see the flag. And the cost they paid and their families. And if you truly understand that, I think it’s impossible not to salute the flag and listen to the anthem,"" La Russa said.

But other managers in the league are apparently in Kapler's corner over the protest, which the manager announced after the elementary school shooting left at least 19 students and two adults dead.

Boston Red Sox manager Alex Cora said he was proud of Kapler, his former teammate, for being vocal.

""He’s a good friend of mine and the kind of guy I respect from afar for what he’s doing, and if this is what he’s doing, good for him,"" Cora said. ""I understand his reasons. He was very open about it and I know there’s a lot of people that are going to support him.""

WHITE SOX'S TONY LA RUSSA CALLS GIANTS' GABE KAPLER'S NATIONAL ANTHEM PROTEST ‘NOT APPROPRIATE’

Texas Rangers manager Chris Woodward called Kapler's actions ""brave,"" without commenting on whether he would have made the same decision.

""I think we’re all frustrated, especially in this country,"" Woodward said. ""Nobody’s happy. It’s not about which side you’re on. It’s just we’ve got to get better as a society. … I’m not going to really make comment either way on whether I would or wouldn’t do what he did.""

Arizona Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo said he was supportive of what Kapler was doing, but noted he tries ""not to get involved in that arena. It’s a very, very sad and touchy subject for me.""

Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts added that Kapler ""is very passionate about things he believes in and that’s his way of protesting. ... I don’t think any of us are happy with what’s going on in our country. I do respect people using whatever platforms they have to address that.""

Washington Nationals manager Dave Martinez said he usually isn't on the field for the anthem, but ""if I’m not out there it’s not because I’m boycotting anything.""

New York Mets manager Buck Showalter also said he respected ""how Gabe feels and the way he’s going about it.""

Asked about Kapler, Philadelphia Phillies manager Joe Girardi responded: ""That’s Gabe’s decision. That’s all, I’m going to leave it at that.""

Rams players not fined over Ferguson protest,"New York, NY (SportsNetwork.com) - The NFL will not issue any discipline to five St. Louis Rams players who displayed a show of support to the protesters in nearby Ferguson, Missouri prior to Sunday's game against the Oakland Raiders.

As the Rams' offense was introduced, wide receivers Tavon Austin, Stedman Bailey, Kenny Britt and Chris Givens and tight end Jared Cook all stood together and raised their arms to pay homage to those who protested a recent grand jury decision not to indict Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson for fatally shooting African-American teenager Michael Brown in August.

The verdict triggered a wave of riots and looting in the St. Louis suburb.

The St. Louis Police Officers Association condemned the players' actions while calling upon the NFL to hand out some sort of punishment, but the league denied that request in a statement issued Monday.

""We respect and understand the concerns of all individuals who have expressed views on this tragic situation,"" NFL vice president of communications Brian McCarthy said in the statement.

Rams head coach Jeff Fisher said after his team's 52-0 win over the Raiders that he was unaware of the players' intentions to conduct the gesture, which drew the ire of SLPOA and prompted the organization to demand a public apology from the NFL.

""The St. Louis Police Officers Association is profoundly disappointed with the members of the St. Louis Rams football team who chose to ignore the mountains of evidence released from the St. Louis County Grand Jury this week and engage in a display that police officers around the nation found tasteless, offensive and inflammatory,"" the SLPOA stated.

""I know that there are those that will say that these players are simply exercising their First Amendment rights,"" said SLPOA business manager Jeff Roorda. ""Well, I've got news for people who think that way -- cops have first amendment rights, too, and we plan to exercise ours. I'd remind the NFL and their players that it is not the violent thugs burning down buildings that buy their advertiser's products. It's cops and the good people of St. Louis and other NFL towns that do. Somebody needs to throw a flag on this play. If it's not the NFL and the Rams, then it'll be cops and their supporters.""",https://www.foxnews.com/sports/rams-players-not-fined-over-ferguson-protest,N/A
Roger Goodell: NFL will support players who protest this season,"NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said Wednesday that the league will back players who decide to protest this season despite the possibility of public criticism.

“We’re supporting our players,” Goodell said during an appearance on CNBC. “We recognize the issues that are going on in our communities. That’s a platform that we want to use to make change and we’re going to do that. We’re going to stand behind our players.”

TOM BRADY USING VIRTUAL REALITY TO LEARN BUCCANEERS OFFENSE

President Trump and other public figures have frequently criticized players in the NFL and other sports leagues who have knelt during the national anthem in recent years. Critics argue that kneeling protests are disrespectful to the American flag and U.S. military veterans.

Trump claims that player protests have contributed to a ratings decline in the NFL and NBA. Goodell did not directly address how the league would respond to criticism from Trump this season, but noted that the NFL’s ratings have been “the envy of every entertainment and sports property.”

The NBA, MLB and other sports leagues postponed games last month as players protested the shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wis. Goodell said the NFL is prepared for the possibility that its own season could be impacted by further boycotts over social justice issues.

“There a lot of things that we’re planning for this season that create some uncertainty and we’re prepared to make the best decisions on behalf of the NFL, on behalf of our players, on behalf of our fans and our partners,” Goodell said.

“We must call for change,” Imboden said afterward on Twitter. “This week I am honored to represent Team USA at the Pan Am Games, taking home Gold and Bronze.”

“My pride however has been cut short by the multiple shortcomings of the country I hold so dear to my heart,” he said. “Racism, Gun Control, mistreatment of immigrants.”

The political protest could lead to disciplinary action by the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee.

“Every athlete competing at the 2019 Pan American Games commits to terms of eligibility, including to refrain from demonstrations that are political in nature. In this case, Race didn’t adhere to the commitment he made to the organizing committee and the USOPC,” Mark Jones, Vice President of Communications, USOPC said in a statement on Saturday.

All squads pushed the limits of the International Olympic Committee’s (IOC) rules about athletes performing political gestures at the Games.

""We felt strongly as a group that we wanted to show support for those affected by discrimination and equality,"" Britain captain Steph Houghton said. ""It was a proud moment because the Chile players took the knee too to show how united we are as sport,""

Chilean players on the other side of the pitch appeared to be unaware of Britain’s protest at first. Once they spotted the kneeling, Chile midfielder Daniela Pardo did the same and her teammates followed.

""It was an issue of not being in sync,"" Chilean midfielder Karen Araya said. ""We weren’t able to communicate properly due to the language. The moment we saw the English taking the knee right away we decided to do the same and of course we are in favor of this type of thing.""

Britain won their match 2-0.

Earlier in July, the IOC extended more guidelines on athletes’ freedom of expression at the Tokyo Games but warned against political gestures during official ceremonies, competitions and in the Olympic Village.

US WOMEN'S SOCCER'S EPIC UNBEATEN STREAK COMES TO AN END IN OLYMPICS MATCH

The IOC said the guidelines were approved by the executive board of the IOC as part of the IOC Athletes’ Commission’s (IOC AC) recommendations. The IOC said the guidelines offer ""further clarity"" on the ""wide range of opportunities available to them to express their views.""

Athletes will be allowed to express a political gesture prior to the start of a competition or during their introduction or the introduction of the team. However, the gesture must meet four different criteria.

The gesture has to be consistent with the ""Fundamental Principles of Olympism,"" cannot be targeted at a certain people, country or organization, cannot be disruptive and cannot already be banned by a nation’s own Olympic committee or federation.

""When expressing their views, athletes are expected to respect the applicable laws, the Olympic values and their fellow athletes. It should be recognized that any behavior and/or expression that constitutes or signals discrimination, hatred, hostility or the potential for violence on any basis whatsoever is contrary to the Fundamental Principles of Olympism,"" the IOC said.

If an athlete breaks the guidelines, the IOC laid out possible discipline. The IOC could have disciplinary hearings, in which the athlete would be required to provide full transparency about their actions.

""The new guidelines are a result of our extensive consultation with the global athletes’ community,"" IOC AC Chair Kirsty Coventry said at the time. ""While the guidelines offer new opportunities for athletes to express themselves prior to the competition, they preserve the competitions on the field of play, the ceremonies, the victory ceremonies and the Olympic Village.

American truckers plan convoy to DC in protest of COVID-19 mandates,"Taking a cue from truckers bordering America's north, a political action committee will partner with truck convoys to protest what it deems as overreaching government COVID-19 restrictions and mandates.

The Great American Patriot Project on Wednesday asked volunteers to contribute, join or support a convoy of truckers slated to travel to Washington D.C. next month.

Routes for the convoys will start in Cleveland, Columbus, Ohio and Fresno, California and will end on March 6 in Washington. They will be met by a congressional welcome committee to discuss policy changes, organizers said.

""I don't think that anybody wants to be told what to do,"" Erica Knight, spokeswoman for the PAC, told Fox News. ""They don't want to deal with these mandates and it's kind of a way to stand up for all the American people against it.""

In an email blast, the PAC said the truckers represent ""peaceful, non-violent Americans who are dissatisfied with the unscientific, unconstitutional government overreach in regards to mandates.""

The convoy comes amid ongoing protests by Canadian truckers calling for an end to COVID-19 mandates in their country. The resistance began several weeks ago when truckers decided to stand and oppose a rule requiring them to be fully vaccinated.

Not being vaccinated could impact their livelihoods as well as the country's supply chain.

On Monday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau invoked that country’s Emergencies Act, a rare move that gives the country's government temporary powers to deal with the border blockades, including using tough legal and financial measures against participating truckers.

"Arizona abortion protest: Police release tear gas, lawmakers ‘held hostage’ in Senate building","Law enforcement officers in Phoenix, Arizona used tear gas to break up a sizable group of protesters outside the state's Senate building following the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to overturn the landmark abortion ruling Roe v. Wade.

""Protesters threatened to break the AZ Senate entryway glass,"" Republican Arizona State Senator Wendy Rogers tweeted, as members were in the middle of voting on a series of bills.

The situation escalated into a ""hostage"" situation as lawmakers were instructed not to exit the building, Republican Arizona State Senator Kelly Townsend said.

The Republican Caucus of the State Senate later called the protest an attempted ""insurrection.""

""We are currently there being held hostage inside the Senate building due to members of the public trying to breach our security,"" Townsend tweeted Friday night. ""We smell tear gas and the children of one of the members are in the office sobbing with fear.""

SUPREME COURT OVERTURNS ROE V. WADE IN LANDMARK OPINION

""I expect a J24 committee to be created immediately,"" she added, referencing the January 6 committee that is investigating the breach of the U.S. Capitol Building on January 6, 2021.

The state's Attorney General, Mark Brnovich, said that ""this wasn't a peaceful or lawful protest.""

""An angry mob defaced the Arizona Peace Officers Memorial last night, after being dispersed from the State Capitol. This wasn't a peaceful or lawful protest,"" Brnovich said. ""We must never tolerate these criminal attempts to tear down our institutions and intimidate our officials.""

According to the lawmakers, law enforcement officers then deployed tear gas to disperse the crowds and regain control of the building.

""Crowd was dispersed with tear gas."" Rogers added, noting the protests were still continuing and the situation remained ""very dangerous.""

MORE THAN 2 DOZEN STATES TO RESTRICT ABORTIONS AFTER ROE V. WADE OVERTURNED

Another lawmaker confirmed the use of tear gas outside the building.

""While working inside we were interrupted by the sound of bangs and smell of tear gas,"" Rep. Sarah Liguori tweeted Friday evening. ""Protestors cleared from the Capitol.""

Heavily-armed officers were seen in and around the legislative building.

The crowd of protesters dispersed and lawmakers resumed their legislative schedule in a secure room.

""We are headed to a secure room to go vote,"" Rogers said.

""Everyone is okay and we are finishing our work,"" Townsend added.

""Feeling safe at the Capitol as I sit by 3 of my fellow senators who are armed,"" added Arizona State Legislator Warren Petersen.

In the hours following the situation, several members thanked the law enforcement officials who protected the Capitol.

""God bless you guys,"" exclaimed Townsend.

""We are safe inside… God bless law enforcement,"" Rogers said.

The Republican Caucus of the State Senate also commended law enforcement for preventing an ""insurrection.""

""Violent pro-abortion protestors' attempts of an insurrection at the Arizona State Senate were thwarted Friday night, thanks to the swift actions from local and state law enforcement,"" said Kim Quintero, the Republican Caucus' communications director.

The GOP group said the ""extremist demonstrations"" were carried out by people ""forcibly trying to make entry [to the building] by breaking windows and pushing down doors.""

""We are incredibly thankful for our local law enforcement who quickly intervened during what could have been a destructive and dangerous situation for our members, staff, and public inside the Senate,"" said Senate President Karen Fann.

Friday was the last day of the session for state senators, who wrapped up a series of votes after the disruption.

The votes included a massive expansion of the state's private school voucher system that passed the House earlier this week.

The U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade Friday afternoon, effectively giving individual states the power to allow, limit, or ban the practice as they see fit.

As of June 24, Planned Parenthood of Arizona paused all abortions, both medical and surgical. Seven of nine licensed providers in the state immediately halted abortions, according to AZ Central.

Arizona has competing laws that either completely ban the procedure or limit it to 15 weeks after a woman becomes pregnant. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey signed the law limiting abortions to 15 weeks in March.

The old law, created in Arizona's territorial days, strictly prohibits abortion. It also calls for a mandatory prison sentence of two to five years for violators. The only exception to the ban is for abortions that are necessary to save a woman's life.

The state Senate's Republican majority said Friday that the old law totally banning abortion is enforceable. For now, it remains unclear which law will take precedence. The state court system, likely the Arizona Supreme Court, will have to settle the issue.

At least 13 states previously passed so-called ""trigger laws"" which ban most abortions, following the high court's decision. These will take effect immediately or within weeks of Roe v. Wade being overturned.

These states include Arkansas, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Wyoming, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a pro-abortion rights research group.

Rittenhouse shot and killed two men and injured a third during unrest following the August 2020 police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin. The teen was acquitted of all charges in November.

The Arizona State protesters, led by Students for Socialism ASU, were met with opposition from students who supported Rittenhouse.

Professors advised Rittenhouse to withdraw from his nondegree-seeking online classes, but the teen is looking to enroll in classes again, Rittenhouse spokesperson Dave Hancock told Fox News.

One student, who did not identify himself to Fox News, led the ASU crowd in ""lock him up"" chants.

""The American justice system does not acquit plurality,"" the student said. ""They are not the objective morality in America … they are founded on genocide … slavery … Their morality is based on White supremacy, so the American justice system does not work for people outside of that umbrella.""

Students for Socialism ASU representatives refused to speak with Fox News during the rally.

""Our rally tonight was a complete success, ASU heard our demands and we showed those fascist counter protestors that we will not be intimidated!"" the group tweeted after the event. ""The people that came out tonight to support killer Kyle Rittenhouse prove our argument, that if Rittenhouse is allowed on campus he will be followed by countless racist, homophobic bigots.""

Nick, who carried a sign in support of Rittenhouse, said: ""I would understand if there was more controversy, if there was no evidence of what happened that night, but there is clear evidence that he did defend himself, and the fact that we have opposition just proves the fact that they didn’t watch the trial or they just don’t love this country.""

"Atlanta: Protesters call for 'violence' against police after shooting leaves 1 dead, officer injured","Protesters in Atlanta are calling for violence against police officers and law enforcement entities following a police-involved shooting on Wednesday that left a state trooper wounded and one man dead.

The Twitter account Scenes from the Atlanta Forest calls for a ""Night of Rage"" on Friday to enact ""reciprocal violence to be done to the police and their allies,"" according to a post.

""Consider this a call for reciprocal violence to be done to the police and their allies. On Friday, January 20th, wherever you are, you are invited to participate in a night of rage in order to honor the memory of our fallen comrade,"" the group wrote on Twitter, in an apparent violation of the platform’s terms and conditions.

The account claims to be a part of Defend the Atlanta Forest, one of the multiple groups protesting in an area where the city is set to construct the new Atlanta Public Safety Training Center.

GEORGIA STATE TROOPER SHOT BY PROTESTER AT 'COP CITY' NEAR ATLANTA

Defend the Atlanta Forest said in a statement to Fox News Digital that it is ""a broad, diverse, decentralized movement to defend the Atlanta forest."" They went on to say they are only a ""news aggregator for the movement"" and ""not affiliated"" with Scenes from the Atlanta Forest.

In another Scenes from the Atlanta Forest tweet, posted several hours later, the group added: ""The police will kill you if given the chance. Now is the time for bravery. Take care of each other. Be dangerous together.""

The group appeared to acknowledge the post was against Twitter’s rule not to incite violence as it said in yet another tweet that its account ""is not long for this world.""

The upcoming event comes after a Georgia State Patrol trooper, wearing a bulletproof vest, was shot in the abdomen Wednesday morning. It happened as police tried to clear an encampment near the site where the $90 million Atlanta Police Department (APD) facility will be constructed.

The sweep was conducted as ""an operation to identify people who are trespassing and committing other crimes on the property,"" the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) said.

ATLANTA TEENS DEAD AFTER SOCIAL MEDIA ARGUMENT LEADS TO SHOOTOUT: POLICE

""At about 9:00 a.m. today, as law enforcement was moving through the property, officers located a man inside a tent in the woods. Officers gave verbal commands to the man who did not comply and shot a Georgia State Patrol Trooper,"" the GBI said in a statement. ""Other law enforcement officers returned fire, hitting the man.""

""Law enforcement evacuated the Trooper to a safe area. The man died on scene,"" it added.

The bureau continued: ""The injured Georgia State Patrol Trooper was taken to a local hospital where he underwent surgery. A handgun and shell casings were located at the scene. The GBI is working the officer-involved shooting and the investigation is still active and ongoing.""

The identities of the officer and the deceased have not yet been released. The officer was hospitalized and is in stable condition.

During a press conference, GBI director Michael Register confirmed that the shooting was in self-defense after the now-deceased individual opened fire ""without warning"" on the trooper.

""An individual, without warning, shot a Georgia State Patrol trooper,"" Register told reporters. ""Other law enforcement personnel returned fire in self-defense and evacuated the trooper to a safe area. The individual who fired upon law enforcement and shot the trooper was killed in the exchange of gunfire.""

Four others were arrested at the scene and taken to the DeKalb County Jail. Charges are pending.

""They're endangering the community and the citizens around this area,"" Register said of the encampment and the protesters, FOX 5 Atlanta reported.

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp also commented on the shooting and said he and his family were praying for law enforcement officers.

""Marty, the girls, and I are praying for this brave Trooper and public safety officers across all law enforcement agencies today,"" he tweeted Wednesday morning. ""As our thoughts remain with him and his family, our resolve also remains steadfast and strong to see criminals brought to justice.""

FBI RELEASES NEW DETAILS ON POLICE USE OF FORCE AS PUBLIC GRAPPLES WITH DISTRUST

The joint task force formed to combat ongoing criminal activity at the APD site includes the GBI, Atlanta Police Department, Georgia Attorney General’s Office, DeKalb County District Attorney’s Office, Georgia State Patrol, FBI, DeKalb County Police Department, Department of Natural Resources and the Georgia Emergency Management Agency.

Defend the Atlanta Forest held a vigil Wednesday evening at the Little Five Points Square to ""memorialize the forest defender"" that was ""murdered by the police,"" it announced on Twitter.

""Today the police shot and killed a forest defender below the canopy of our beloved forest,"" the group said. ""No one can bring our friend back to us. An innocent life has been taken and the machines continue.""

""We will not go quietly into this dark night,"" it added.

ATLANTA POLICE SEEK SUSPECT IN FATAL CHRISTMAS EVE SHOOTING

""Police killed a forest defender today, someone who loved the forest, someone who fought to protect the earth & its inhabitants,"" the group continued in a tweet.

""This is why we organize to stop Cop City. And we will. In honor of their life, and the lives of everyone killed and imprisoned by the police.""

The group also announced another event on Saturday, where members are encouraged to ""wear black in mourning"" for the dead member.

These events come amid heightened tension between protesters and the police, involving several arrests over several months over the APD construction.

""The Atlanta Police Department seeks to turn 300 acres of forest into a tactical training compound featuring a mock city. This project was announced to the shock of community members who had been given no opportunity to weigh in on the proposal. The entire process has been shadier than the forest itself,"" Defend the Atlanta Forest's website reads.

According to the group, they are explicitly protesting the new ""Cop City"" as it will ""hyper-militarize law enforcement"" and ""will serve as a national model of police militarization and budgetary bloat.""

The group names the 2020 death of George Floyd and others as its motivation to protest police violence.

The group also claims it does not advocate for violence and that ""no one has been harmed by participants in this movement.""

Last week, anarchists in Atlanta also targeted Brasfield & Gorrie, the general contractor of the police facility, and spray-painted graffiti on its buildings.

""B&G stop cop city,"" the graffiti read, according to photos. ""We have the numbers,"" another spray-painted message read.

Also, last month, police arrested five people at the APD site location. They were also charged with domestic terrorism.

On Dec. 14, the GBI wrote: ""Yesterday, December 13, 2022, our agents assisted APD and other local, state, and task force members in an operation to remove barricades blocking some of the entrances to the training center.""

""Prior to yesterday’s operation, APD and other agencies had made several arrests over the past few months for the ongoing criminal activity at the site location. Some of the criminal activities include carjacking, various crimes against persons, destruction of property, arson, and attacks against public safety officials. Law enforcement continues to address the criminal acts committed by the individuals that continue to occupy the area of the proposed training site,"" it said.

The arrested individuals included Francis Carroll, 22, of Maine; Nicholas Olson, 25, of Nebraska; Serena Hertel, 25, of California; Leonardo Vioselle, 20, of Macon, Georgia; and Arieon Robinson, 22, of Wisconsin.

""After police cleared the area of concern, which included makeshift treehouses, they found explosive devices, gasoline, and road flares,"" the GBI said in its statement on Dec. 14.

ATLANTA: PROTESTERS CALL FOR 'VIOLENCE' AGAINST POLICE AFTER SHOOTING LEAVES 1 DEAD, OFFICER INJURED

The protests began peacefully on Saturday before spiraling into chaotic riots, according to FOX 5. Over the span of several hours, destruction ensued through several blocks of the downtown area.

Protestors were angry about the death of 26-year-old Manuel Esteban Paez Teran, who was killed by police after he allegedly refused demands from authorities on Wednesday and fired a gun at state troopers at the site of the new Atlanta Public Safety Training Center.

The activist reportedly identified as a nonbinary person who went by the name Tortuguita (""little turtle"" in Spanish) and used they/it pronouns. Protesters carried signs with Tortuguita's name on Saturday.

""An individual, without warning, shot a Georgia State Patrol trooper,"" Georgia Bureau of Investigations' Michael Register told reporters earlier this week.

The Georgia State Patrol trooper, who was wearing a bulletproof vest, was shot in the abdomen. The law enforcement officer is in stable condition and is recovering from surgery.

""Other law enforcement personnel returned fire in self-defense and evacuated the trooper to a safe area. The individual who fired upon law enforcement and shot the trooper was killed in the exchange of gunfire.""

On Saturday, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp spoke out against the riots, saying violence of any kind will not be tolerated.

""While the state continues to respect peaceful protest, acts of violence against person or property will not be tolerated. Those committing such unlawful acts will be arrested and prosecuted fully,"" Kemp said.

Photos show the activists allegedly lit an Atlanta PD vehicle on fire in addition to targeting the Atlanta Police Foundation building.

The police car that was set ablaze has since been extinguished.

""Atlanta Police officers have responded to a group damaging property at several locations along Peachtree [Street],"" the Atlanta PD said in a statement Saturday, according to Fox 5. Several arrests have been made at this time and order has been restored to the downtown space. This is still an active and ongoing investigation and we will not be able to provide specifics on arrests numbers or property damaged, at this time.""

Caution tape also wrapped around several buildings including a Wells Fargo location that suffered several broken windows, photos at the scene show.

Activists had been camped out on an 85-acre planned facility known as ""Cop City"" in recent days to protest the planned training center. When Teran was shot and killed after authorities tried to remove the protesters from the plot of land on Wednesday, they vowed to continue their protests.

A total of seven people were arrested and charged with domestic terrorism on Wednesday.

"Atlanta's Tyre Nichols protest remains peaceful after 1,000 National Guard troops activated","National Guard troops activated by Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp were not needed in downtown Atlanta Friday night as dozens of protesters held a peaceful demonstration following the release of bodycam video showing Memphis police officers brutally beating Tyre Nichols following a traffic stop.

A small gathering of protesters met at Centennial Olympic Park, where they chanted and demanded justice for Nichols, who died of the injuries he sustained during the beating. The five Memphis officers involved were fired and have been charged with murder and other crimes.

The Atlanta protesters held signs that read, ""Jail Killer Cops!"" and ""End Police Terror."" They were accompanied by a heavy police presence surrounding City Hall and the Georgia State Capitol. Barricades had been set up to block the entrance, Fox 5 Atlanta reported.

The peaceful protest stood in contrast to last weekend's violence, when six individuals were arrested on domestic terrorism charges after rioters threw rocks, launched fireworks and burned a police vehicle in front of the Atlanta Police Foundation building. The riot was instigated by anti-police activists opposed to the construction of the Atlanta Public Safety Training Center – a $90 million police training facility for the Atlanta Police Department dubbed ""Cop City"" by its opponents.

"California parents, students protest high school's plans to cut honors classes for equity reasons","Hundreds of San Diego parents and students last week protested a since-withdrawan plan to remove 11th-grade honors classes at the city's largest high school for equity purposes, according to local reports.

An email from Patrick Henry High School (PHHS) Principal Michelle Irwin dated April 13 says all 11th-grade History and English honors courses at the school will be eliminated, following a decision by the school last year to eliminate Advanced World History, Advance Physics, Advanced Biology and two other classes for gifted students, according to The San Diego Tribune.

""We are eliminating the 11th grade English and history Honors courses. This change will bring our English and history course offerings into alignment with what is currently offered at PHHS in 9th, 10th and 12th grade,"" a document attached to Irwin's email, obtained by The National Desk, reads.

Irwin continued: ""We are proud of the work taking place at Patrick Henry High School to support district goals of increasing student access to challenging course offerings while ensuring high expectations for all. I would like to apologize to parents who interpreted this work as lowering the academic standards for students. I want to be clear that Patrick Henry students are some of the best academically in all of California, and we plan to continue this legacy of excellence.""

A section of the document Irwin sent to the school community on April 13, titled, ""Rationale For Changes,"" stated that the since-withdrawan changes to curricula would help ""create more balanced heterogeneously grouped classes; eliminate stigma,"" and ""provide a well-balanced course offering for all students.""

"Rioting, looting linked to George Floyd protests leaves trail of destruction across American cities","American cities are spending Monday morning digging out from scenes of destruction after demonstrations against the police-involved death of George Floyd gave way to a fifth straight night of looting and rioting, resulting in another wave of arrests.

As of Monday morning, at least 4,400 people have been taken into custody nationwide in relation to the chaos, according to an Associated Press tally. Meanwhile, countless more business owners whose livelihoods already have been impacted by the coronavirus pandemic are finding their stores damaged and ransacked.

“It's one of the most challenging times that I’ve seen in my 30 years of policing,” NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea told ""Fox & Friends"" on Monday after a night of looting in Manhattan’s Soho neighborhood left sidewalks outside high-end retail stores littered with debris and broken glass. “I can tell you that we had thousands of police officers deployed last night.”

FOX NEWS CREW REPORTS HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE SEEN STEALING FROM STORES IN NEW YORK CITY

“In terms of protest, in terms of balancing orderly protest, respecting people’s rights to peacefully assemble, that was going on all day, large crowds in Brooklyn, smaller crowds in Queens, significant crowds in Manhattan,"" Dermot continued. “But then it turned dark, it turned ugly and it turned that way fast.”

The New York Post reports that police arrested dozens of looters in the Big Apple overnight. A witness told the newspaper that some of them acted in an apparent system where suspects would break into stores before leaping into getaway vehicles outside.

Videos on social media showed crowds targeting a wide array of businesses throughout Manhattan, emerging from shattered storefronts with everything ranging from Chanel handbags to bicycles.

The ongoing demonstrations that have gripped the U.S. and the entire world were sparked by the death of Floyd, a black man who pleaded for air as a Minneapolis officer pressed a knee into his neck. That officer – Derek Chauvin – has been charged with third-degree murder and reportedly has been transferred to a maximum-security prison.

Floyd's death came after tensions had already flared after two white men were arrested in May for the February shooting death of black jogger Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia, and the Louisville police shooting death of Breonna Taylor in her home in March.

HISTORIC MINNEAPOLIS RESTAURANT BURNED DOWN BY RIOTERS JUST DAYS BEFORE REOPENING

Despite fresh concerns about the spread of coronavirus, Americans from all walks of life have come together en masse to demonstrate against the deaths and call for the reform of police departments and the criminal justice system. While many of the gatherings have been peaceful – including some that saw officers take a knee in solidarity with protesters – others have frequently turned violent, often when late afternoon gives way to nightfall.

A Sunday afternoon of mostly peaceful protests in Boston made a turn for a worse overnight when protesters clashed with officers, throwing rocks, breaking into several stores, and lighting a police vehicle on fire.

Boston police tweeted that at least 40 people had been arrested as of 3 a.m. Monday, adding that seven police officers had been hospitalized and 21 police cruisers were damaged.

In Portland, Oregon, police deployed tear gas to disperse a large crowd downtown late Sunday night after authorities said projectiles were thrown at officers.

Earlier, police said protesters smashed windows at the federal courthouse, and authorities on loudspeakers declared the gathering a civil disturbance.

A protest along the historic Route 66 into downtown Albuquerque also turned violent early Monday after police reported demonstrators setting small fires and officers said they were fired upon.

Albuquerque police spokesman Gilbert Gallegos told the Associated Press that officers reported shots fired at them in front of the historic Kimo Theater after a mostly peaceful demonstration disbanded. Gallego said there was damage to several properties in the area, including broken windows and some stealing from stores – although there were no reports of injuries.

A little farther north in Dallas – one of the many U.S. cities to have instituted a curfew in hopes of quelling the unrest – police made dozens of arrests.

Some Americans have even tried to get in the way of the looters, with mixed results.

“But we have to unite the city and what is happening throughout the city right now is dividing the city, it is not uniting the city,” he said. “There is no justice in robbing stores and looting your own neighborhood and burning the city down.”

Even though an estimated 16,000 National Guard troops have been mobilized to quell the rioting and looting, it’s not clear when the violence will end.

But in the meantime, Shea is calling on all Americans to show restraint.

Hundreds of Colorado students protest history curriculum changes that would promote patriotism,"Hundreds of students walked out of classrooms around suburban Denver on Tuesday in protest over a conservative-led school board proposal to focus history education on topics that promote citizenship, patriotism and respect for authority, in a show of civil disobedience that the new standards would aim to downplay.

The youth protest in the state's second-largest school district follows a sick-out from teachers that shut down two high schools in the politically and economically diverse area that has become a key political battleground.

Student participants said their demonstration was organized by word of mouth and social media. Many waved American flags and carried signs, including messages that read ""There is nothing more patriotic than protest.""

""I don't think my education should be censored. We should be able to know what happened in our past,"" said Tori Leu, a 17-year-old student who protested at Ralston Valley High School in Arvada.

The school board proposal that triggered the walkouts in Jefferson County calls of instructional materials that present positive aspects of the nation and its heritage. It would establish a committee to regularly review texts and course plans, starting with Advanced Placement history, to make sure materials ""promote citizenship, patriotism, essentials and benefits of the free-market system, respect for authority and respect for individual rights"" and don't ""encourage or condone civil disorder, social strike or disregard of the law.""

The proposal from Julie Williams, part of the board's conservative majority, has not been voted on and was put on hold last week. She didn't return a call from The Associated Press seeking comment Tuesday, but previously told Chalkbeat Colorado, a school news website, that she recognizes there are negative events that are part of U.S. history that need to be taught.

""There are things we may not be proud of as Americans,"" she said. ""But we shouldn't be encouraging our kids to think that America is a bad place.""

A student demonstrator, Tyrone G. Parks, a senior at Arvada High School, said Tuesday that the nation's foundation was built on civil protests, ""and everything that we've done is what allowed us to be at this point today. And if you take that from us, you take away everything that America was built off of.""

The proposal comes from an elected board with three conservative members who took office in November. The other two board members were elected in 2011 and oppose the new plan, which was drafted in response to a national framework for teaching history that supporters say encourages discussion and critical thinking. Detractors, however, say it puts an outsize emphasis on the nation's problems.

Tension over high school education has cropped up recently in Texas, where conservative school board officials are facing criticism over new textbooks. Meanwhile, in South Carolina, conservatives have called on an education oversight committee to ask the College Board, which oversees Advanced Placement courses, to rewrite their framework to make sure there is no ideological bias.

The College Board says the outline provides a balanced view of American history, and officials plan clarify instructions to teachers to make that clear by the end of the month.

Participating students were not punished, school district spokeswoman Lynn Setzer said. They will receive unexcused absences unless their parents call to relay permission for missed classes, Setzer said.

Superintendent Dan McMinimee has met with some of the students and renewed his offer to continue discussions on the issue. ""I respect the right of our students to express their opinions in a peaceful manner,"" he said. ""I do, however, prefer that our students stay in class.""",https://www.foxnews.com/us/hundreds-of-colorado-students-protest-history-curriculum-changes-that-would-promote-patriotism,N/A
NYC says 1.1M students can attend climate strike protest without punishment,"School districts across the country are debating whether to follow New York City’s lead after it allowed its students to participate in Friday’s global youth climate strikes without punishment.

New York City’s Department of Education made the announcement last Thursday, saying that 1.1 million public school students could skip class to participate in the strike if they had parental consent.

Friday’s youth climate strikes will come three days before the United Nations Climate Action in New York City, and the General Assembly meeting that follows it. Other climate strike protests are expected around the world with millions in attendance, The New York Times reported.

“This is so cool! NYC Public Schools are letting students leave class to join the #ClimateStrike on September 20th,” wrote Jamie Henn, founder of the environmental organization 350.org. “Also, holy smokes, this thing could get HUGE.”

But some critics, cited by The New York Times, accused Mayor Bill de Blasio of allowing the permissive policy to further his own political interests. The New York Post's editorial board, meanwhile, derided the decision as an “out-and-out government sponsorship of a particular point of view.”

Peters, who pastors a church in Knoxville and has drawn attention before because of his activism, has lately made local headlines for organizing a protest against ""A Drag Queen Christmas"" show that will be performed Thursday evening at the Tennessee Theatre. The show has prompted backlash and support from those on both sides of the issue.

The drag show was not on the agenda during the most recent meeting of the Knoxville City Council, but several residents still showed up to voice their opposition to the event, according to local CBS affiliate WVLT.

VIDEO OF ‘ALL AGES’ CHRISTMAS DRAG SHOW SPARKS OUTRAGE: ‘THESE CHILDREN ARE BEING GROOMED BY ADULTS’

""You will see nothing at a drag show that you wouldn’t see on ‘Dancing with the Stars,’ a child’s pageant or a cheerleader at a football game,"" one drag performer who showed up to the emotionally charged public forum maintained.

Another Knoxville resident who attended displayed a replica of a spine to city leadership during his comments. ""I brought this to remind you of what a spine looks like,"" he said. ""Grow one.""

The Tennessee Theatre released a statement from Executive Director Becky Hancock earlier this week advising parental discretion after the venue received complaints about the event initially being advertised for all ages.

DRAG QUEEN STORY HOUR'S RADICAL ORIGINS AND THE SUBVERSIVE SEXUALIZATION OF OUR CHILDREN

""We also have received a small number of complaints about the show being advertised for ‘all ages,’"" Hancock wrote in part. ""To clarify, an earlier version of the marketing copy provided by the promoter that is renting the theater for the event included that phrase, and we removed it. The approved description of the show is posted currently on the event calendar listing at TennesseeTheatre.com. The current description notes that ‘parental discretion is advised,’ which could be used for many types of content or subject matter.""

Hancock further advised anyone who does not approve of the show's material to avoid attending.

""I strongly believe, both personally and as the director of this organization, that decisions on what children should or should not see should be left up to their parents or guardians,"" said Hancock, who added that the theater ""is proud to offer a wide variety of events, entertainment and experiences for the public to consider and attend if they so choose.""

""The left has their own religion, and their religion is not Christianity."" — Pastor Ken Peters

Peters, who said he believes drag ""is not good for the community in general,"" argued that allowing minors at such events is symptomatic of a deeper problem emerging in American culture.

""When you invite kids or allow kids into adult-style entertainment, then I think the culture has an obligation to draw a line,"" he said. ""I think once we stop drawing a line on kids, we enter into a dangerous period in our country. We open up kids to an adult world that they're too young for. So, for me, this is about loving our culture, loving our nation and keeping kids as innocent as possible in this day and age.""

Peters said there has been ""huge pushback"" in the Knoxville community about the drag show, and he pointed blame at Democratic Knoxville Mayor Indya Kincannon.

""This is the most conservative area of one of the most conservative states,"" said Peters. ""East Tennessee is the pocket of conservatism in the United States. But the problem is you have the downtown area of Knoxville and a mayor who is a leftist, and she will not enforce good laws.""

DRAG QUEEN STARRING IN CHRISTMAS PLAY WANTS TO ‘KICK DOWN’ TRADITIONAL VALUES: ‘F--- FAMILY’

The pastor referenced obscenity laws on the books in Tennessee that some argue would apply to such events, especially if minors are present. He believes the mayor of the city, which boasts on its website of working with the LBGTQ+ community to promote ""a safe, accountable, inclusive and welcoming community so all Knoxville residents feel represented, respected and appreciated,"" supports such events.

Kincannon's office did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment by the time of publication, but it released an earlier statement about the controversy.

""Part of what makes Knoxville a great place to live and raise a family is its cultural diversity — having many options to enjoy entertainment of your choosing,"" Kincannon said, according to local ABC affiliate WATE.

"Portland mayor tear-gassed by federal agents, riot declared","A riot was declared in Portland just after midnight Thursday morning after Mayor Ted Wheeler’s tense visit with protesters-- where he was booed, told to resign, given a list of demands and tear-gassed by federal agents.

His visit ended with his security detail engaging in a struggle with protesters late Wednesday night as they worked to get the mayor to safety, a report said.

Earlier, he moved with protesters to the fence outside of the federal courthouse where he stood at the front and was tear-gassed along with the crowd, according to New York Times correspondent Mike Baker.

Wheeler called the tear-gassing an ""egregious overreaction,"" telling Baker he didn't see anything in the crowd that warranted the reaction by federal officers.

""This is not a de-escalation strategy,"" he said. ""This is flat-out urban warfare and it's being brought on this country by the president and it's got to stop now.""

PORTLAND BANS POLICE FROM WORKING WITH FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT

As Wheeler left, a few protesters following him tried to push against his security team once he had entered a building. Others threw water bottles and other projectiles at the glass door, according to Baker.

Portland's City Council passed new policies on Wednesday that immediately bans all police bureau members from working with federal law enforcement and prevents them from intentionally arresting or using force on journalists and legal observers.

Wheeler had joined protesters downtown earlier in the evening for a listening session where he thanked them for opposing the Trump administration’s “occupation” of the city in the deployment of federal agents.

""I think what we're doing tonight is actually the best thing we can do right now,"" Wheeler told hundreds in the crowd after a protester asked how to get federal officers out of the city, according to KGW-TV. ""Be here, be heard, be unified, and be clear. We didn't want them, we didn't ask for them, they're not trained for what they're being asked to do. And we want them to leave.""

Wheeler, who has repeatedly said he opposes the deployment of federal officers to the city, was nearly drowned out by shouts and jeers and calls to resign and was loudly booed when he told a protester that he didn’t support abolishing the police department.

He then addressed a much larger crowd from a raised balcony, saying “I am here tonight to stand with you.” He received some cheers when he chanted “Black lives matter!” with the crowd.

Some protesters also threw fireworks at the courthouse and tried to knock down the fencing erected outside.

Wheeler, who is also the police commissioner, has been accused by some of not reining in local police, who have used tear gas multiple times before federal agents arrived early this month in response to nearly two months of nightly protests since George Floyd was killed. Others, including business leaders, have condemned Wheeler for not bringing the situation under control before the federal agents arrived.

The mayor's office did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.

Truck convoy departs California for DC area to protest COVID mandates; finds support along journey,"A truck convoy headed to the outskirts of Washington D.C., to protest COVID-19 mandates and restrictions, among other issues, departed Northern California on Tuesday night in what is expected to be a five-day journey across the country.

Thousands of truckers began traveling this week in a series of convoys from different departure points as part of the American Trucker’s Freedom Convoy. The California convoy left Fresno and was traveling through Quartzsite, Arizona by Wednesday afternoon, said Erica Knight, a spokeswoman for the Great American Patriot Project, a political action committee that has partnered with event organizers.

The convoy is one of several making their way to or near Washington after two years of COVID-19 mandates, and to voice frustration with several issues, including illegal immigration, big tech companies and energy costs.

""It's really the government overreach… the mandates were and have been a big thing but this has really crossed beyond that over the last two years,"" Knight told Fox News.

The Fresno convoy is slated to arrive in Thornburg, Virginia, about 65 miles south of the capital, on Sunday. Their destination will be the Dominion Speedway, a motorsport complex, which will host a trucker tailgate and concert.

Images provided to Fox News show the drivers being greeted on the side of roads and on freeway overpasses by supporters.

Many truck convoys began departing various states last week. Some of the organizers plan to meet with lawmakers in Washington, Knight said, to talk about a variety of issues, specifically energy costs.

""Right now we're depending on Russia for oil and they're doing what they're doing,"" Knight said, referring to Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. ""Why are we outsourcing our oil to a dictator that's starting a war right now?""

Bob Bolus, who owns a trucking company, led a convoy from Scranton, Pennsylvania last week. He told Fox News at the time that the truckers were simply asking for their rights to be reinstated.

""What they're seeing today is just a prelude of what's going to come if they don't sit down and listen to us and get rid of these restrictions,"" he said. ""Because then we'll shut the country down. We control this country. Not the government.""

Two arrested at NYC councilman's apartment in 'gays against groomers' protest over Drag Queen Story Hour,"Two women were reportedly arrested after a group of self-proclaimed ""gays against groomers"" protesters allegedly targeted the office and apartment building of an openly gay New York City councilman Monday in apparent outage of his support for a recent drag story time session at a Manhattan library.

""Tonight the Drag Story Hour protesters came to my apartment building and gained entry. My super called the cops and two of them were arrested for trespassing,"" Erik Bottcher, a Council Member representing District 3, tweeted Monday. ""This is pure hate, unmasked. If they think this is going to intimidate us, they’re mistaken. Our resolve is strengthened.""

After protesters allegedly vandalized Bottcher’s office in the Chelsea neighborhood around 3 p.m., they arrived outside his apartment building. Two women were arrested when they breached the building around 5 p.m., N.Y. Daily News reported. Charges against them were pending Monday night.

Fox News Digital followed up with the New York City Police Department for more information Tuesday.

ERIC ADAMS SILENT ON NYC SECOND MIGRANT DEATH BY SUICIDE IN SHELTER SYSTEM AHEAD OF TITLE 42 EXPIRATION

Meanwhile, Bottcher shared four photos of messages scrawled on the sidewalk in front of the apartment building.

The messages, appearing to be written in chalk, included, ""OK, Groomer,"" ""Erik Boccher [sic] is a pedo child groomer,"" ""child predator,"" and ""b****er.""

The incident prompted responses from New York City Mayor Eric Adams and U.S. Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y.

""This is outrageous. Completely outrageous,"" Adams wrote, sharing Bottcher’s tweet. ""Erik, you stand up for our city every single day and these cowardly bigots have no place here. Thank you to the NYPD for your quick work and sending the message that this hate will not go unchallenged.""

""I stand with my friend @ebottcher, Drag Queen Story Hour, and the LGBTQ+ community against this disgusting display of hate,"" Nadler added. ""Elected officials have a responsibility to condemn this false, dangerous rhetoric that’s being used as a new way to discriminate against the community.""

In another tweet, Bottcher shared several photos of vandalism in the hallway outside his district office.

The councilman said a group people who call themselves ""gays against groomers"" scrawled the term, ""B****er,"" a vulgar variation of his last name, on the walls. ""We will not be cowed,"" Bottcher wrote, sharing another three photos. ""We will not be silenced. We will continue to stand up against hate.""

In a related video shared by the councilman, an unidentified voice inside his office says, ""I would love to be in drag and read the Bible to the children."" Someone outside the closed office door responds, ""How come you don’t have police officers reading to the kids? How come you don’t have firefighters reading to the kids? How come you don’t even have a circus clown reading to the kids?""

""Only drag queens,"" the protester outside the locked door shouts. ""What’s up with that Erik? What’s up with that? Are you grooming them, Erik? You’re trying to sexualize children.""

One or several people are heard knocking on the door and trying to open it, but the door is locked.

""Some gay people in the community don’t approve of that!"" the voice says. ""And I’m one of them.""

""The gays against grooming, they don’t approve of this at all,"" another voice adds.

Accompanying that video, Bottcher tweeted, ""This is what the anti-Drag Story Hour mob subjected my staff to at our office, before they vandalized the hallway. This is not okay.""

In another video shared by the councilman from a high vantage point, a group of people are seen pushing and yelling on the street below Bottcher’s apartment building. The councilman said it was, ""Video of the Drag Story Hour protesters physically attacking one of my neighbors last night.""

Drag Story Hour NYC, formerly Drag Queen Story Hour NYC, is a program that ""produces storytelling and creative arts programs for children and teens, presented by local drag artists, in libraries, schools, and other community spaces in all five boroughs of New York City, and virtually,"" according to its website.

In June, the New York Post reported that the program has received approximately $207,000 in taxpayer cash from New York City’s budget set aside for LGBTQ services. The program, which involves cross-dressed performers reading and interacting with children as young as age three, has been criticized for organizing activities during the school day often without first seeking parental consent, the report says.

Tyre Nichols' mother urges peaceful protest: 'I don't want us burning up our cities',"Tyre Nichols' mother is urging Americans to ""protest in peace"" as the Memphis Police Department is preparing Friday to release the bodycam footage showing the law enforcement interaction that led to her 29-year-old son’s death.

RowVaughn Wells made the remark during a candlelight vigil Thursday night, hours after the five former Memphis officers allegedly involved in the Jan. 7 altercation were charged with murder and other crimes. As of Friday morning, four of those five officers posted bond and were released from jail.

""When that tape comes out tomorrow, it’s going to be horrific. I didn’t see it, but from what I hear it’s going to be horrific,"" Wells told a crowd that had gathered at the Tobey Skate Park.

""But I want each and every one of you to protest in peace. I don't want us burning up our cities, tearing up the streets because that’s not what my son stood for,"" she added. ""And if you guys are here for me and Tyre, you will protest peacefully.""

BIDEN SAYS TYRE NICHOLS’ DEATH A ‘PAINFUL REMINDER’ OF ‘DISPARATELY IMPACTED’ MINORITIES IN JUSTICE SYSTEM

The footage is expected to be released by the Memphis Police Department around 7 p.m. ET Friday.

Ahead of its release, Memphis Police Chief Cerelyn Davis also cautioned people not to react violently after viewing it.

Ukraine’s flag projected onto Russian UN ambassador’s NYC townhouse in protest,"Vladimir Putin's war on Ukraine arrived on the doorstep of the Russian ambassador to the United Nations.

A Ukrainian activist group defiantly bathed his Manhattan townhouse in the blue and yellow colors of the Ukrainian flag and anti-Vladimir Putin slogans as a protest against Putin's horrific assault on the Ukrainian people.

""The message is to show that Ukrainians are not afraid and will find any Russian official, even if they are trying to hide,"" Arthur Zgurov told Fox News.

SEN. DAINES, REP. SPARTZ PUSH BIDEN TO RAMP UP SUPPORT FOR UKRAINE AFTER VISITNG WAR-TORN COUNTRY

Zgurov, a Ukrainian neurosurgeon, is now a New York-based activist with the pro-Ukrainian group Razom For Ukraine.

The group projected the Ukrainian flag on the front facade of the red brick Georgian style mansion on the Upper East Side of Manhattan that is the official residence of Russian U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia.

The phrases ""#PUTINISAWARCRIMINAL"" and ""#ZELENSKYISAHERO"" were also projected onto the mansion's exterior just after Nebenzia arrived. He remained inside, in the third-floor library.

""The message to Nebenzia would be, Mr. Nebenzia, stop lying. You lie too much. And too many things have happened because of your lies. Be the man and speak out."" said Zgurov.

Razom For Ukraine provides medical supplies and assistance to the besieged Ukrainian people and has held demonstrations in New York City against the war. More than one dozen of its members gathered across the street from the townhouse on East 75th Street on Tuesday night, and used a hand-held projector to light up the building.

RUSSIA ACCESSES BIDEN OF HAVING DEMENTIA

Fox News exclusively witnessed and recorded the event.

""I am very glad that we came to his house, because he is one of the most evil spreaders of propaganda,"" said Razom member Irina Paliashvili about Putin's ambassador. Paliashvili, an American and Ukrainian-based lawyer, was able to leave Kyiv just as the war started.

""He represents an evil regime and he promotes an evil regime, so he himself is evil,"" she said. ""I think it is crucial that these people understand they are watched by the world, that they cannot get away with this criminal barbaric war that they wage against Ukraine.""

Nebenzia has been branded as ""Putin's Puppet"" by critics for his loyal defense of the invasion and continued denials at the U.N. Security Council meetings on Russian atrocities, war crimes and crimes against humanity. He branded the killings of citizens in Bucha as ""as staged provocation"" and ""a false flag attack."" He has continued to blame Ukraine President Volodymry Zelenskyy and Ukrainians for starting the war. He has used the Russian veto in the Security Council to block a resolution that criticizes his government as he continues to push Putin's propaganda. Razom For Ukraine is also calling for Russia to be expelled from the Security Council because of its crimes.

Zgurov has wrestled with the images from his home country that are caused by Putin and his government and he cannot come to terms with the mass destruction and killing.

""If those were aliens who would do that, I can understand. But when humans do the same thing to humans, that is just despicable, disgusting. And I cannot find the words that I am allowed to say to express my feelings.""

Fox News has seen Nebenzia at the government residence. He did not emerge from the townhouse during the Razom protest, but arrived shortly before it began.

UKRAINIANS DESCRIBE HORRORS OF LIVING UNDER RUSSIAN OCCUPATION: ‘ARE YOU NOT EVEN HUMAN BEINGS?’

The ambassador is chauffeured to and from work by his driver in a late model black Mercedes. Fox News has also seen a chef deliver daily food and supplies in a minivan with Russian diplomatic plates and a housekeeper and other staff enter and exit the building. A sleek Ducati motorcycle has at times been parked behind its locked gate. While previous pro-Ukraine street demonstrations have targeted the Russian U.N. mission office complex on nearby East 67th Street and a Russian diplomatic apartment building in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, this is the first time that message was brought directly to the ambassador's house.

Moscow bought the elegant mansion in the exclusive neighborhood for $35 million in 2008. The real-estate history blog ""DaytonianinManhattan"" reported that the building dated to 1892 and was once owned by a descendant of a signer of the Declaration of Independence. In 1915 the mansion became known as the R. Horace Gallatin house, after its patrician owner, who was a descendant of Elbridge Gerry, a founding father who not only signed the Declaration of Independence but also later served as President James Madison's vice president. Gallatin was also the great-grandson of Albert Gallatin, who served as treasury secretary under Presidents Madison and Thomas Jefferson, and was a U.S. senator and congressman from Pennsylvania. Albert Gallatin was sent to St. Petersburg, Russia, in 1813 to negotiate an end to the War of 1812.

There are no outward signs that the mansion is the official residence of the Russian ambassador. Unlike other foreign government properties in Manhattan, there is no flag indicating what country the building belongs to, no brass plaque with the nation's name on it, and even the pair of standard ""No Standing"" parking signs flanking either side of the building's front curb are not the usual ""Diplomatic"" parking zone signs that would prevent ordinary New Yorkers from parking there. Observers believe this was all done to conceal the true identity of the home's resident.

U.N.: OVER 5 MILLION REFUGEES HAVE NOW FLED UKRAINE

Similar protests supporting Ukraine have been staged around the globe at other Russian government properties.

In London, a group of journalists projected the Ukrainian flag onto the Russian Embassy to protest the killings of reporters covering the war.

In Lisbon, pro-Ukraine activists did the same, shining the Ukrainian flag on the front of the Russian Embassy to Portugal.

In Washington, D.C., a large Ukrainian flag was unfurled in front of the Russian embassy and an image of the flag was projected onto that building.

In Lithuania, protesters dyed the small lake in front if the Russian embassy in Vilnius red, naming it the ""Lake of blood."" An Olympic swimmer swam through the red-colored water and others floated in it to represent the dead Ukrainian civilians who have fallen victim to Putin's horrors.

""Putin is a killer war criminal, everybody knows that,"" Zgurov said. ""Zelenskyy is a hero. Our president is indeed a hero.""

Paliashvili called Putin ""a war criminal"" who is ""probably something very close to Hitler and to the Nazi regime.""

WA couple charged with illegally entering US Capitol during Jan. 6 protest,"Two people who live outside Tacoma, Washington, have been charged with illegally entering the U.S. Capitol and engaging in disruptive behavior during the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection in Washington, D.C.

Puyallup residents Holly Christensen, 44, and her husband, Scott Christensen, 49, are named in charges unsealed in U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia last month, The Seattle Times reported.

Court documents show they’ve been ordered to appear before a U.S. magistrate judge Thursday to enter pleas. It’s not immediately known if they have lawyers to comment on the allegations.

The alleged crimes are misdemeanors, punishable by up to a year in prison and maximum fine of $100,000.

Scott Christensen is a former realtor who had worked in California and Colorado before moving to Puyallup, where he sold real estate and became a pastor in 2015 at a Tacoma church that closed earlier this year, according to state business records.

The charges said Scott Christensen and his wife were spotted later that afternoon in the Capitol Rotunda where he was captured on police body camera video conversing with a police officer.

Liberal Yale Law students derail bipartisan 'free speech' event in chaotic protest; police called to scene,"A bipartisan panel on civil liberties at Yale Law School was disrupted last week when more than 100 law students tried to drown out and intimidate the speakers, who eventually needed police to escort them out of the building, according to reports.

The school’s Federalist Society hosted the March 10 panel, which featured Monica Miller, of the progressive American Humanist Association, and Kristen Waggoner, of the conservative Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF). About 120 student protesters showed up with signs attacking the ADF to shout down the speakers, with one reportedly recorded on audio telling a member of the conservative group that she would ""literally fight you, b----.""

""It was disturbing to witness law students whipped into a mindless frenzy. I did not feel it was safe to get out of the room without security,"" Waggoner told the Washington Free Beacon.

A member of the Federalist Society said the panel was supposed to show that a liberal atheist and a Christian conservative could agree on issues of free speech.

CHRISTIAN STUDENT SUES MIAMI SCHOOL FOR RELIGIOUS DISCRIMINATION

Miller and Waggoner reportedly discussed a recent U.S. Supreme Court case that dealt with freedom of religion and free speech on college campuses. The case, Uzuegbunam v. Preczewski, involved a Chistian student, Chike Uzuegbunam, who was prevented from preaching at a public college in Georgia. The ADF, American Humanist Association, along with other progressive groups supported Uzuegbunam. The ADF, which has won several Supreme Court cases establishing religious exemptions from civil rights law, argued the case.

The event’s moderator, Yale Law School Professor Kate Stith, had to pause the event due to the intensifying commotion. Stith can be heard reminding those present of the school’s free speech policies, which prohibit any protest that ""interferes with speakers’ ability to be heard and of community members to listen.""

But the student protesters continued to jeer Stith and the speakers, with some raising their middle fingers, according to the Beacon. Stith reportedly responded by telling the students to ""grow up,"" which drew intensified verbal attacks from the protesters.

Stith could then be heard on audio telling the students that if the commotion continued, ""I'm going to have to ask you to leave, or help you leave.""

As the protesters exited the event, one student was heard yelling ""F--- you, FedSoc,"" the report said. The chaos reportedly continued in the hallway, with protesters stomping and clapping while raising chants of ""protect trans kids"" and ""shame, shame.""

Police officers arrived to escort Miller and Waggoner out of the building, which caused further condemnation from students. More than 400 students – 60% of the student body – signed an open letter supporting what they called the ""peaceful student protest,"" which they claimed was put in danger due to the police presence, according to Yale Daily News.

""The danger of police violence in this country is intensified against Black LGBTQ people, and particularly Black trans people,"" the Beacon quoted the letter as reading. ""Police-related trauma includes, but is certainly not limited to, physical harm.""

The Federalist Society told the paper it they did not call the police.

Waggoner later tweeted: ""My hot take: Good lawyers win with civility & persuasion, not physical intimidation and threats of violence. We aren’t afraid to engage with people and ideas we disagree with. Apparently many of the students missed this lesson.""

Yale Law School responded to Fox News Digital’s request for comment with a statement: ""We regularly work with student groups for various events and speakers. When visitors to the Yale campus bring their own security, as in this case, University policy requires the Law School to inform Yale Police. We then work with the police to determine the appropriate level of support for the particular visitor and/or event.""

The statement continued, ""The Law School follows the University’s free speech policy and procedures, which includes a three strikes rule. As soon as the moderator read the University’s policy for the first time, the students exited the event, and it went forward. Members of the Administration are nonetheless in serious conversation with students about our policies, expectations, and norms.""

"BEIJING BACKS DOWN: Chinese citizens 'empowered' after COVID protests, China researcher says","Chinese citizens feel empowered after protests against ""draconian COVID-19 restrictions"" led Chinese authorities to ease regulations, a human rights researcher told Fox News.

""People are fed up with the restrictions,"" said Yaqiu Wang, a senior China researcher for Human Rights Watch. ""There's so much pent-up anger and frustration because there have been massive human rights violations as a result of the restrictions, not because of COVID itself.""

Demonstrations erupted across several cities in China in the final days of November as residents took to the streets to protest the nation's ""zero-COVID"" policies. In some cities like Wuhan, protests turned violent as police and residents clashed.

""We often say protest in China is useless because the government is too powerful,"" said Wang. ""But this is an example that if you actually go out and demand for what you want, you get it, or at least you get some of it.""

Chinese officials loosened COVID-19 restrictions after Chinese citizens across several cities protested against the country's strict ""zero-COVID"" policy that has led to city-wide lockdowns, mandatory COVID-19 testing and mass quarantine. Beijing changed course on the strict policies to help quell protests because the ""zero-COVID"" approach is taking a toll on residents, according to a Tiananmen Square protester.

""This has to be understood in the context of three years of draconian COVID restrictions,"" Wang said. To enter a hospital, a grocery store or a company office, Chinese residents ""have to show a negative result.""

""Some people had medical emergencies, but they couldn't get to the hospital because they could not leave their apartment, and some of those people died,"" Wang continued.

When asked whether the Biden administration supports the rights of Chinese citizens to protest, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, ""Of course we do.""

""We support the right of people everywhere, whether it's in China, whether it's Iran, whether it's anyplace else, to protest peacefully, to make known their views, to vent their frustrations,"" Blinken said.

Despite Chinese authorities easing restrictions, the surveillance of and crackdown on protesters has been harsh, according to Wang.

""I heard of sources telling me that they went into the protest scenes, and they thought they were anonymous,"" she said. ""But later they were visited by the police.""

""They went to the protest scene yesterday, and they got visited by the police today,"" Wang continued. ""The police were operating in a pretty efficient manner.""

Wang said she believes her sources were tracked by police using surveillance footage or through the location services in their phones.

Regardless of the police enforcement, residents feel authorities easing restrictions is a win, Wang said.

British animal rights activists protest at London steakhouse owned by 'Salt Bae',"A group of animal rights and climate justice activists tried to sit in at the London steakhouse Nusr-Et, which is owned by social media personality ""Salt Bae,"" but were removed by staff at the upscale restaurant on Saturday evening.

Animal Rebellion said they staged the protest because ""luxury dining represents exploitation, climate devastation and inequality.""

The protesters sat down at tables with a menu entitled ""Plant Based Future,"" which includes ""support for farmers and fishing communities to transition to a plant-based food system"" and ""rewilding of freed-up land and ocean.""

Video posted by the activist group shows waitresses at the restaurant dragging out a protester and her menu.

Nusr-Et is owned by Nusret Gökçe, who exploded on social media in recent years with his viral videos of gold-coated steaks and other extravagant meals. The chain has locations in at least 18 cities around the world.

Nusr-Et did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Animal Rebellion also staged a sit-in protest at Mana, another upscale restaurant in London that features a full-course dinner menu for about $230 a person.

Simon Martin, the chef and owner at Mana, said in a statement that he is ""confused as to why the protestors chose to target a restaurant that prioritizes sustainability and animal welfare.""

""The protest last night at Mana disrupted the operation of a small business that has already suffered economically from COVID and the ongoing energy crisis during the busiest night of the week,"" Martin said in a statement shared with Fox News Digital.

""Mana has always been a highly sustainable restaurant, sourcing hyper local and sustainably produced vegetables from small businesses just like ourselves who abstain from GMO’s, herbicides, and pesticides.""

MIGRANTS REMAIN CAMPED IN NYC STREET AFTER NEARLY 48 HOURS TO PROTEST EVICTION FROM FREE STAY AT LUXURY HOTEL

Britain takes in fewer asylum-seekers than some of its European neighbors including France and Germany, but has seen a sharp increase in the number of people trying to reach the U.K. across the English Channel in dinghies and other small boats.

More than 45,000 people reached Britain by that route in 2022, and most applied for asylum. The system for considering asylum applications has slowed to a crawl because of political turmoil and bureaucratic delays, leaving many migrants stuck in hotels or other temporary accommodation.

The Channel crossings have become a hot political issue, with the Conservative government promising to ""stop the boats."" Opponents accuse the government of demonizing desperate people fleeing war and poverty.

Canadian news host slammed for suggesting Russia behind massive 'freedom' trucker protest,"Critics are slamming a government-funded Canadian news outlet for suggesting Russia is behind the popular ""Freedom Convoy"" protest, where truckers drove across the country in protest of a vaccine mandate.

""I do ask that because given Canada's support of Ukraine, in this current crisis with Russia, I don't know if it's far-fetched to ask,"" CBC host Nil Koksal told Minister of Public Safety Marco Mendicino Friday.

""But there is concern that Russian actors could be continuing to fuel things as this protest grows. But perhaps even instigating it from, from the outset.""

Video of the exchange had been viewed nearly half a million times as of Sunday morning.

""Again, I'm gonna defer to our partners in the public safety of trained officials and experts in that area,"" Mendicino responded, deflecting the question.

And we're providing direction and guidance to residents to ensure that there is a peaceful protest but, at the same time, providing direction and guidance to residents,"" Medocino added.

The CBC is a Canadian public broadcaster that is funded by the government. The Freedom Convoy has been described as a grassroots movement; it has no known ties to Russia.

Koksal’s remarks set off a torrent of criticism on Twitter, with people slamming the current state of media, questioning how the clip is real and slamming liberals for focusing on ""Russia, Russia, Russia.""

The Freedom Convoy left Vancouver for Ottawa Jan. 23 to protest the federal government’s vaccine mandates for cross-border truckers and is calling for an end to coronavirus restrictions.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, however, condemned the convoy and said it is composed of a ""small fringe minority"" of people who hold ""unacceptable views.""

Ahead of the convoy making it to Ottawa, the Canadian province of Nova Scotia made it illegal for people to gather along a highway to support the truckers. Those who disobeyed the directive faced fines between $3,000 to $10,000, while corporations faced fines between $20,000 and $100,000.

The convoy made it to the Canadian capital Saturday, and thousands of people were seen on the streets in support of ending the coronavirus restrictions.

"China lodges 'stern protest' over spy aircraft shoot-down, calls US 'irresponsible'","The People's Republic of China lodged a ""stern protest"" to the United States over shooting down the unmanned surveillance aircraft that floated across the country last week.

Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Mao Ning fielded questions Wednesday, when she was asked about the ongoing controversy surrounding the surveillance aircraft, parts of which have been recovered by U.S. investigators.

US MILITARY SHOOTS DOWN CHINESE SPY BALLOON OVER ATLANTIC OCEAN

""The Chinese side has repeatedly shared information on the unintended entry of the unmanned Chinese civilian airship into U.S. airspace. I would like to stress that the U.S.’s downing of the unmanned Chinese civilian airship by force is unacceptable and irresponsible. The Chinese side has lodged a stern protest,"" said Mao.

The balloon was shot down off the coast of South Carolina by U.S. military fighter jets on Saturday afternoon. A senior U.S. military official said that an F-22 was used to bring down the balloon at 58,000 feet with a single A9X missile.

CHINA MAINTAINS SPY BALLOON IS CIVILIAN, CLAIMS SOME IN US 'HAVE HYPED IT UP TO ATTACK AND SMEAR CHINA'

Mao voiced concern that media reports characterizing the balloon as a Chinese ""threat"" are deteriorating already strained U.S.-Chinese relations.

""I would also like to stress that exaggerating or hyping up the ‘China threat’ narrative is not conducive to building trust or improving ties between our two countries, nor can it make the U.S. safer,"" said Mao.

SPY BALLOON LIKELY SENT EXTENSIVE INTELLIGENCE TO CHINA, EXPERTS SAY

Pressed for comment on recent U.S. communications briefing other nations on the balloon situation, she added, ""It is hoped that the U.S. will communicate with other countries based on facts.""

Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III said in a statement after the balloon was shot down that ""President Biden gave his authorization to take down the surveillance balloon as soon as the mission could be accomplished without undue risk to American lives under the balloon’s path.""

RUBIO SAYS BIDEN WAITING TO TELL AMERICAN PUBLIC ABOUT CHINESE BALLOON A ‘DERELICTION OF DUTY’

Mao also reacted to comments made about China in President Biden's State of the Union address. In the speech, Biden described his hope for ""competition"" with the People's Republic of China, but warned that ""if China threatens our sovereignty, we will act to protect our country.""

""A healthy and stable China-US relationship is in the fundamental interest of both peoples, and meets the shared expectation of the international community,"" Mao said. ""On China’s part, we will handle China-U.S. relations in accordance with the three principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation proposed by President Xi Jinping.""

She added, ""At the same time, we will firmly defend our sovereignty, security and development interests.

Chinese retirees protest in the streets over health insurance cuts,"Hundreds of retirees took to the streets in the Chinese cities of Wuhan and Dalian on Wednesday to protest cuts to medical benefits, according to residents and social media posts, following widespread demonstrations last year over COVID curbs.

In the central city of Wuhan, hundreds of mainly elderly people could be seen outside the city's central Zhongshan Park in video clips posted to social media.

One video from Wuhan verified by Reuters showed pushing and shoving between protestors and uniformed security personnel. Reuters could not immediately verify images from Dalian and some others from Wuhan widely shared on social media.

AS COVID RAVAGES CHINA, US EXPANDS TESTING SYSTEM FOR INCOMING TRAVELERS

The demonstrations come weeks ahead of China's annual parliamentary gathering in early March.

The retirees were protesting local reforms including a recent cut to the monthly personal medical benefit allowance for retirees, from $38 per month to $12, according to Wuhan residents. It followed a protest over the same issue last week in Wuhan.

Some sang songs including the Internationale, which is popular at protests in China. Others held phones aloft and recorded the event.

""This money is very little, but to old people it is life-saving money,"" said Wuhan resident Zhang Hai, who did not attend Wednesday’s protest but said some of his friends did.

""People are not prosperous, so every little bit of money is hugely important,"" he told Reuters.

While street protests over local issues are not unheard of in China, Wednesday's events follow rare demonstrations in November in cities across the country over China's tough zero-COVID policy, which Beijing abruptly abandoned in December.

The protests come as many local governments are fiscally strained after COVID curbs ravaged the economy and as three years of spending on coronavirus controls depleted funds.

In China's health benefit system, some money goes to a personal medical allowance and other funds are pooled.

Several Wuhan residents said that they believed police knew about the protest in advance, as notices advising people not to attend had circulated on social media, including one seen by Reuters.

While a spokesperson for the Munich airport confirmed to The Associated Press that the northern runway had briefly been closed and the rerouting of planes had caused short delays, a spokesperson for the Berlin airport said that a police operation was ongoing but that air traffic had not been affected.

Photos showed police officers attempting to remove some of the activists from the roads and pictures posted to the activists' Twitter account later showed members holding signs blocking city streets.

Dutch farmers form 'freedom convoys' to protest government's strict environmental rules,"Farmers in the Netherlands have formed their own version of Canada’s ""Freedom Convoy,"" blocking highways with tractors, setting bales of hay on fire and taking other actions to protest the government’s recent goal to cut emissions that could force some farms to shutter.

""Where is our prime minister? This country is on fire and the farmers are standing up to the government,"" a spokesman for the protests said while standing on top of a hay bale in the town of Eerbeek last week, the Guardian reported.

Roughly 40,000 protesters gathered in central Netherlands to protest plans to curb the emissions of nitrogen and ammonia last month. Weeks later, the protests have continued across the country with no sign of abating.

Photos and videos show farmers causing a highway near Germany’s border to come to a halt, with some Germans reportedly even joining the protest. Hundreds of businesses in three towns were virtually shut down due to three different protests, the Guardian reported Saturday. Meanwhile, some supermarkets have barren shelves due to the farmers also targeting distribution centers earlier this month.

DUTCH POLICE SHOOT AT TRACTOR DURING NIGHT OF FARM PROTESTS

Farmers say the protests are not intended to anger their fellow citizens and consumers, but to force the government into a referendum.

The Dutch government is aiming to cut nitrogen and ammonia emissions by 50% by 2030 in a bid to improve air, land and water quality. The plans include cutting back on fertilizer used on farms and ratcheting back the number of livestock by an estimated 30%.

The country is one of the largest agricultural producers in the world, exporting roughly $97 billion in 2020 worth of fruit, flowers, vegetables, dairy products and meat.

""If you ask me now, I’d say, please don’t even think about it,"" dairy farmer Jaap Zegwaard said of whether he would recommend farming to younger generations. ""There are so many worries. Life’s much too beautiful to deal with what’s going on in the agriculture sector at the moment.""

""Ask the average farmer: it’s profoundly sad,"" he said.

Farmers say they are being unfairly targeted by the rules while other industries, such as aviation, construction and transportation, are also contributing to emissions and face fewer rules. Farmers also argued that they have not been provided a clear picture of their futures in light of the reforms.

ANGRY DUTCH FARMERS CLOG UP 700 MILES OF HIGHWAY DURING PROTEST OVER EMISSION RULES

The convoys of tractors are a nod to Canada’s Freedom Convoys, the Guardian reported, which were held across Canada earlier this year to protest the nation’s strict coronavirus vaccine policies.

Fishermen in the Netherlands have also joined the protests, blocking the port in Harlingen with trawlers last week, EuroNews reported.

The demonstrations have become so widespread that Rolling Stones’ frontman Mick Jagger gave a shout-out to the farmers in Dutch during an Amsterdam concert Thursday.

The Dutch protests gained more attention on Tuesday when police opened fire on a 16-year-old farmer driving a tractor in the northern area of the country during a protest. The teenager allegedly moved his tractor toward police, according to German outlet ​​Deutsche Welle. After initially being held on suspicion of attempted manslaughter, the teenager was released without charge. No one was injured during the incident, according to police.

Freedom Convoy: What Canadian truckers demand as US protest set to start this weekend,"The Canadian trucker ""Freedom Convoy"" continues to gain momentum, but as a splinter movement in the U.S. gains more support it is important to understand what exactly the protests demand.

The cause has drawn international attention and support, with a U.S. trucker protest possibly starting this weekend in Los Angeles around the Super Bowl, the Department of Homeland Security announced.

In a statement posted to Facebook on Jan. 26, the Canadian truckers clearly stated their demands, which they tied to personal freedoms from government overreach: The truckers demanded in the letter that the Canadian government remove the vaccine mandates and to terminate any government-backed digital tracking platform such as the COVID-19 vaccine passport and contact tracing programs.

Trudeau also accused the truckers of ""hate, abuse, and racism,"" according to the Independent.

""Specifically it is about removing the mandates,"" Canadian trucker Mat Mackenzie said on ""America’s Newsroom"" last week. ""A lot of people think it has to do with the trucker mandate in terms of border crossing, but in fact, it is about restoring the freedom to all Canadians.""

French demonstrators take to the streets for nationwide protest against the government's pension reform plans,"Public transportation, schools and electricity, oil and gas supplies were disrupted in France as demonstrators numbering in the tens of thousands took to the streets Tuesday for a third round of nationwide strikes and protests against the government's pension reform plans.

The demonstrations came a day after French lawmakers began debating a pension bill that would raise the minimum retirement from 62 to 64. The bill is the flagship legislation of President Emmanuel Macron's second term.

Tens of thousands of people marched in the cities of Nice, Marseille, Toulouse and Nantes, and in other places across the country. An afternoon protest was set to take place in Paris.

Last week, an estimated 1.27 million people demonstrated, according to authorities, more than in the first big protest day on Jan. 19. More demonstrations, called by France's eight main unions, were planned for Saturday.

Rail operator SNCF said train traffic was severely disrupted Tuesday across the country, including on its high-speed network. International lines to Britain and Switzerland were affected. The Paris metro was also disrupted.

Saad Kadiui, 37, a consulting cabinet chief who had to go through a disrupted Paris train station Tuesday, said he did not support the strikes, which he called ""wearisome."" ""There are other ways to protest over the pension reform,"" he said.

FRENCH PRIME MINISTER ELISABETH BORNE UNVEILS PENSION OVERHAUL AIMED AT RAISING THE RETIREMENT AGE

Kadiui supports the principle of the pension reform but wants the bill to be improved at parliament. ""I think that for some jobs, 64 is too late,"" he said.

Power producer EDF said the protest movement led to temporarily reduced electricity supplies, without causing blackouts. More than half of the workforce was on strike at the TotalEnergies refineries, according to the company.

The Education Ministry said close to 13% of teachers were on strike, a decrease compared to last week's protest day. A third of French regions were on scheduled school breaks.

Macron vowed to go ahead with the changes, despite opinion polls showing growing opposition. The bill would gradually increase the minimum retirement age from 62 to 64 by 2030 and accelerate a planned measure providing that people must have worked for at least 43 years to be entitled to a full pension, among other measures.

The government argues the changes are designed to keep the pension system financially afloat. France’s aging population is expected to plunge into the system into deficit in the coming decade.

FRANCE'S GOVERNMENT UNVEILS PLANS TO TIGHTEN HUNTING SAFETY RULES, NO OUTRIGHT BAN INSTITUTED

The debate at the National Assembly and the Senate is expected to last several weeks.

Philippe Martinez, secretary general of the powerful CGT union, called on the government and lawmakers to ""listen to the people."" Speaking on French radio network RT, he denounced Macron’s attitude as ""playing with fire,""

Macron wants to show that ""he is able to pass a reform, no matter what’s the public opinion, what the citizens think,"" Martinez asserted.

The head of the CFDT union, Laurent Berger, also called on the government to ""listen"" to the crowd that took to the streets. ""One can only respond to social tension through the democratic exercise of power,"" he told French newspaper La Croix.

"Gen Z climate activist: Throwing paint, stopping traffic is privileged protest and unhelpful","Defacing artwork, shutting down freeways, and pouring milk on the floor is simply privileged protest and doesn't actually inspire people to take action against climate change, a conservationist told Fox News.

""Activists are trying to deface property and artwork specifically because it is shocking,"" Danielle Butcher, executive vice president of the American Conservation Coalition, a conservative environmental nonprofit, told Fox News. ""The tactics, they're focused on sparking conversation, whatever that means, but they're not actually helping the environment tangibly.""

""I saw the video of them throwing soup on a van Gogh, and I immediately cringed,"" Butcher continued. ""It hurt to see, and I think that's what they are going for.""

Climate protesters this year have targeted Vincent van Gogh, Claude Monet and Leonardo da Vinci paintings. Two climate protestors tossed tomato soup on a van Gogh painting, two others plastered potato on a Monet piece and another threw cake at the Mona Lisa.

Protesters have also poured onto freeways to stop traffic in the name of cutting fossil fuel use and poured out milk onto the floors of stores to fight for environmental justice.

RADICAL CLIMATE ACTIVISTS TARGET PRICELESS ART BUT EXPERTS WARN VANDALS ONLY HURTING THEIR CAUSE

""I am begging them to stop using these tactics,"" Butcher said. ""You cannot annoy people into agreeing with you.""

""And certainly throwing mashed potatoes or glue or soup or dumping milk on a grocery store floor, those are not ways that you convince people you are in the right position,"" she continued.

Timing and context are essential when it comes to effective activism, Butcher told Fox News.

Greta Thunberg removed by German police from site of mass-climate change protest at coal mine,"German police reportedly removed 20-year-old climate change activist Greta Thunberg from the site of a mass protest over the demolition of an abandoned village for the expansion of a coal mine.

Thunberg, a self-proclaimed Swedish ""autistic climate justice advocate,"" joined thousands of demonstrators who showed up Saturday to protest the clearance of the hamlet of Luetzerath, walking through the nearby village of Keyenberg and past muddy fields in western Germany.

On Sunday, Thunberg again failed with police requests to leave the site, before two officers carried her away, the German newspaper BILD reported, showing a photo of Thunberg smiling with two officers, each wearing a helmet outfitted with a face shield, on each side taking her by the arms.

According to BILD, German police said that 70 officers were injured and nine protesters were taken to the hospital in an ambulance during the weekend demonstrations though no one was seriously injured. Organizers of the protest, however, claimed Saturday several demonstrators were critically hurt.

THUNBERG SWIPES AT ANDREW TATE AMID HUMAN TRAFFICKING CHARGES IN TWITTER SPAT

The operation to evict climate activists who flocked to the site in Luetzerath, west of Cologne, kicked off Wednesday morning and progressed steadily over the following days. Police cleared people out of farm buildings, the few remaining houses and a few dozen makeshift constructions such as tree houses.

On Saturday, thousands of people demonstrated nearby against the eviction and the planned expansion of the Garzweiler coal mine. There were standoffs with police as some protesters tried to reach the village, which is now fenced off, and the mine.

Environmentalists say bulldozing the village to expand the Garzweiler mine would result in huge amounts of greenhouse gas emissions. The government and utility company RWE argue the coal is needed to ensure Germany’s energy security. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last February has heightened concerns for Europe to ensure its energy independence from the Kremlin.

The German regional and national governments, both of which include the environmentalist Green party, reached a deal with RWE last year allowing it to destroy the abandoned village in return for ending coal use by 2030, rather than 2038. The Greens' leaders argue that the deal fulfills many of the environmentalists’ demands and saved five other villages from demolition and that Luetzerath is the wrong symbol for protests. Activists reject that stance.

Police said in a statement Sunday that nearly 300 people have been removed so far from Luetzerath. They added that ""the rescue by RWE Power of the two people in underground structures continues; beyond that, the clearance by police is complete."" They said that 12 people were detained in connection with Saturday's incidents. Demolition of the buildings in Luetzerath is already underway.

On Saturday, police said Thunberg briefly sat on an embankment at the edge of the mine and officers carried her a few steps away after didn't comply with calls to move for her own safety, German news agency DPA reported, adding that she then went on her way. Video shows Thunberg linking arms with other protesters as police attempt to push the group of them away from the demolition site.

By Monday, police said the last two protesters who had remained inside a self-dug tunnel for days to prevent heavy equipment from being brought in to bulldoze the hamlet had left the site.

Greta Thunberg smiles as German police carry her away during environmental protest over coal mine expansion,"A smiling Greta Thunberg was carried away by German police on Tuesday while protesting the destruction of a German village for the expansion of a coal mine, the second time that the 20-year-old Swedish activist was removed during the multi-day environmental demonstration.

Video from the protest near the village of Luetzerath in western Germany shows Thunberg with dozens of activists sitting in the dirt near the mine in protest and chanting as police stand nearby.

Thunberg was one of several protesters carried away by police after running to the edge of the Garzweiler open pit mine and standing on the brink of the open pit, German news agency dpa reported.

The mine has a sharp break-off edge, according to the news outlet. Police said it was dangerous and people were prohibited from staying there.

GERMAN POLICE SURROUND AND CRACK DOWN ON CAMP OF ANTI-COAL PROTESTERS

Video shows the climate activist only smiled as two police officers carried her away. As Thunberg stands with the officers away from the mine’s edge, another activist walks and asks Thunberg for a selfie before the two share a laugh.

Energy company RWE said that one protester was able to enter the mine in a ""very reckless"" move, according to the news agency.

Police and RWE started evicting protesters from Luetzerath on Jan. 11, removing roadblocks, chopping down treehouses and bulldozing buildings.

Thunberg had joined the protests over the weekend and was previously carried away by police after she failed to comply with their requests to leave the site.

Protests continued Tuesday at several locations in North Rhine-Westphalia.

Dozens of climate activists glued themselves to a main street in Germany’s western city of Cologne and to a state government building in Duesseldorf. Near Rommerskirchen, a group of about 120 activists also occupied the coal railroad tracks to the Neurath power plant and were carried away when they refused to leave the tracks, DPA reported.

"Hundreds protest after Iranian woman's alleged murder over hijab law, demand 'death to the dictator'","Video from Iran shows hundreds gathered in protest at the funeral for a 22-year-old whom police arrested and allegedly beaten to death for violating strict laws requiring women to cover their hair, prompting further calls to deny Iran's president entry to the U.S. as he prepares to speak at the U.N. General Assembly this week.

Iran’s morality police arrested Mahsa Amini, a Kurdish-Iranian woman, on Sept. 14 near a train station while visiting the capital with her family. No explanation was offered, but witnesses said that the police accused Amini of failing to properly wear her hijab (headscarf).

The police rushed Amini to hospital shortly after she fell into a coma during her detention, claiming that she had collapsed while in custody, but her family said they saw evidence of beatings. Amini died three days later, but the police deny that Amini was killed.

Stéphane Dujarric, the spokesman for the U.N. Secretary-General, told Fox News Digital that the colleagues in the U.N. office in Iran were ""deeply saddened"" by Amini’s death and extend their ""heartfelt condolences."" He did not confirm whether the secretary-general would raise the topic during a potential meeting with Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi this week.

IRAN'S ‘MORALITY POLICE’ ACCUSED OF MURDERING WOMAN FOR NOT PROPERLY WEARING HIJAB, SPARKING PROTESTS

Her death prompted waves of protests over the weekend, with women gathering in the streets to remove their hijab or cut their hair. Other reports indicate that mobile internet has been cut in several areas of Tehran as the protests continue.

According to an Iranian news Twitter account 1500 Tasvir, ""A group of women in Tehran took the hijab off and blocked the street to protest the murder of Masha Amini by the Hijab Police of the Islamic Republic, chanting ‘ISIS, ISIS.’""

Ashok Swain, a professor at Uppsalla University in Sweden, posted a video on Twitter and noted that protestors shouted ""death to the dictator"" at Amini’s funeral, calling the women ""simply inspirational.""

IRANIAN LEADER APPEARS IN PUBLIC AFTER CANCELING ENGAGEMENTS DUE TO ILLNESS

Additional video posted online Monday showed Iran security forces beating protestors in Tehran near the detention center where Amini was held prior to falling into her coma. Anti-riot forces also sprayed protestors in an effort to clear them from the streets.

""Mahsa Amini represents every young Iranian man and woman,"" Foreign Desk Editor-in-Chief Lisa Daftari told Fox News Digital. ""Her senseless death is symbolic not only of the regime’s barbaric treatment of its citizens, but she represents the many victims whose lives have been taken.""

Iran executed second detainee over anti-theocracy protest,"Iran executed a second prisoner on Monday who was detained and convicted during nationwide protests against the country's theocracy.

Footage was aired on state television that the country claimed shows the man stabbing and killing two security force members before fleeing the scene.

The public hanging of Majidreza Rahnavard came less than a month after his alleged stabbings were carried out in frustration over security forces killing protesters. The short turnaround shows how quickly Iran is executing those detained in the demonstrations.

Activists said at least a dozen people have already been sentenced to death in closed-door hearings. Nearly 500 people have been killed since the demonstrations began in mid-September, according to Human Rights Activists in Iran, a group that has been monitoring the protests. An additional 18,200 people have been detained.

AT LEAST 24 IN IRAN FACE EXECUTION FOR INVOLVEMENT IN PROTESTS

Iran's Mizan news agency, which is under the country's judiciary, claimed Rahnavard fatally stabbed two security force members and wounded four others on November 17 in the city of Mashhad. The agency said the execution was carried out Monday morning in Mashhad.

State TV aired footage showing a man chasing another around a street corner before then standing over him and stabbing him after he fell against a parked motorbike. The same man was also shown stabbing another man immediately after the first attack. The attacker then ran away from the scene.

Mizan identified the individuals killed as ""student"" Basij, paramilitary volunteers under Iran's Revolutionary Guard. The Basij have deployed in major cities and have attacked and detained protesters. In many cases, the demonstrators have fought back against the Basij.

A heavily edited state television report aired after Rahnavard's execution showed footage of him in the courtroom saying he started hating the Basijis after watching social media videos of the forces beating and killing protesters.

The Mizan report alleged that Rahnavard had attempted to flee to a foreign country when he was arrested.

Mashhad, a Shiite holy city activists say has been subject to strikes, closed shops amid demonstrations after Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman, died in custody after she was detained by Iran's morality police.

According to Mizan, Rahnavard was convicted in Mashhad's Revolutionary Court. The tribunals have been criticized internationally for not allowing those on trial to select their own lawyers or see the evidence against them.

Rahnavard had been convicted on the charge of ""moharebeh,"" a Farsi word meaning ""waging war against God,"" which carries the death penalty.

"Iran government's protest crackdown kills dozens of children, prompts calls for removal from United Nations","Dozens of children have died during the Iranian government’s crackdown on protests across the country, prompting some to urge the United Nations to kick Iran from the global body.

""The time has come for the international community to stand with the people of Iran, to accept their will, and to recognize their right to resist and defend themselves,"" the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) told Fox News Digital. ""This can be done by closing the regime's embassies and designating the Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist group, in order to hold the regime accountable and to put an end to their impunity.""

""The time has come to refer the dossier of the mullahs’ crimes to the United Nations Security Council and to take steps toward expelling this murderous regime from the U.N.,"" the statement concluded.

Iran's regime has failed to stop protests that spread across the country over the past three months following the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini while in police custody, reaching over 140 cities and towns. Reports indicate that at least 700 people have died due to the government’s crackdown, including dozens of children.

IRAN HAS SENTENCED 400 PROTESTERS TO PRISON SENTENCES UP TO 10 YEARS: REPORT

UNICEF on Nov. 27 issued a statement in which it reported that as many as 50 children may have died during the protests, but that the number could be as high as 65. Iran has periodically denied such actions.

""The Islamic Republic of Iran is a party to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and has an obligation to respect, protect and fulfill the rights of children to life, privacy, freedom of thought and peaceful assembly,"" UNICEF said in a statement last month.

""The best interest of children should be at the center of government action, creating ways where children can safely claim their rights in all circumstances.""

According to NCRI, five of the victims are under 10 years old, and the majority of the victims have been male. The largest number of child victims came from Zahedan. Most of the children died due to gunshots, but some were killed by baton blows or severe beatings from the security forces.

Iran’s policies toward protesters, as well as its generally oppressive policies for women, prompted the U.N. on Wednesday to oust the country from its seat on the Commission on the Status of Women.

NCRI told Fox News Digital that the U.N. should go even further and eject Iran from the entire organization, referring to Article 6 of the U.N. Charter, which states that ""a member of the United Nations which has persistently violated the principles contained in the present Charter may be expelled from the Organization by the General Assembly on the recommendation of the Security Council.""

Arshia Takdastan, 18, was sentenced by Iran’s Revolutionary Court in the northern city of Sari Tuesday after being arrested in coastal city of Nowshahr roughly 100 miles west.

The circumstances around his arrest remain vague but Takdastan is said to have participated in a Sept. 21 protest in Nowshahr before being detained.

PROTESTS AGAINST REPRESSIVE REGIMES DEMONSTRATED GREATEST PUSHBACK IN DECADES AS CITIZENS DEMAND FREEDOM

Takdastan was also sentenced to six years in prison for ""disrupting security and inciting people to kill each other,"" along with ""propaganda against the institution,"" reported Iran International.

The 18-year-old was also sentenced to two years in prison for ""insulting the Supreme Leader.""

It is unclear if he will be required to fulfill his full prison time before his execution.

The ruling on Takdastan came one day after 18-year-old Mehdi Mohammadifard was sentenced to death for participating in a Nowshahr protest on Sept. 30.

An informant told HRANA that his confession was ""extracted under torture and ill-treatment.""

FREEDOM CONVOY PROTESTERS DESCRIBE INTERACTIONS WITH POLICE: 'IT GOT REALLY BAD'

Lich was arrested last Thursday in Ottawa and was charged with counseling to commit mischief, CTV News reported. She said at a bail hearing on Saturday that she would give up on advocating for the movement and return to Alberta, the outlet reported.

Lich started the GoFundMe account that raised millions for those participating in the convoy protest , but the account was soon halted and funds were raised on a separate platform.

Lich said in a tearful clip shared to social media last Wednesday that she was anticipating the arrest , and thanked those who stood alongside her.

Thousands protest COVID mandates and restrictions in Ottawa,"Thousands of protesters gathered in Canada’s capital on Saturday to protest vaccine mandates, masks and lockdowns.

The sounds of honking horns echoed around Ottawa’s downtown core. A convoy of trucks and cars parked in around Parliament Hill with some parking on the grounds of the National War Memorial before police asked them to move.

""Parking on this sacred ground that includes the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier was a sign of complete disrespect,"" Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson tweeted.

Some compared COVID restrictions to fascism and made use of Nazi symbols on upside down Canadian flags. One truck carried a Confederate flag while many carried expletive-laden signs targeting Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

The statue of the late Terry Fox, a national hero who lost a leg to bone cancer as a youngster, then set off in 1980 on a fundraising trek across Canada, was draped with an upside down Canadian flag with a sign that said ""mandate freedom.""

David Santos said he came from Montreal because he believes the vaccine mandates are not health-related but what he calls a ""control thing"" by governments.

ARRESTED CANADIAN LEADER'S STARK WARNING TO US ON BIG GOVERNMENT: ‘YOU CANNOT TAKE YOUR FREEDOMS FOR GRANTED’

The convoy of truckers and others prompted police to prepare for the possibility of violence and warn residents to avoid downtown. A top Parliament security official advised lawmakers to lock their doors amid reports their private homes may be targeted.

Trudeau has said Canadians are not represented by this ""very troubling, small but very vocal minority of Canadians who are lashing out at science, at government, at society, at mandates and public health advice.″

The prime minister's itinerary for the day usually says he is in Ottawa if he's at home, but on Saturday it said ""National Capital Region"" amid a report he's been moved to an undisclosed location.

Some are, in part, protesting a new rule that took effect Jan. 15 requiring truckers entering Canada be fully immunized against the coronavirus. The United States has imposed the same requirement on truckers entering that country.

PSAKI: ABBOTT AND DESANTIS' POLITICALLY-MOTIVATED VACCINE MANDATE POLICIES WILL KILL PEOPLE

The Canadian Trucking Alliance said a great number of the protesters have no connection to the trucking industry, adding they have a separate agenda to push. The alliance said in a statement that the industry must adapt and comply with this mandate, noting the vast majority of drivers have done so.

The organizers of the protest have called for the forceful elimination of all COVID-19 restrictions and vaccine mandates and others called for the removal of Trudeau.

Some opposition Conservative lawmakers served coffee to the protesters and the party leader met with some truckers. The protest has also attracted support from Donald Trump Jr. and some Fox News personalities.

""Today the threat against democracy isn't only happening in America,"" former U.S. Ambassador to Canada Bruce Heyman tweeted. Heyman earlier said the confederate flag and what it represents is offensive to most Americans and should be to Canadians as well.

The Parliamentary Protective Service expects as many as 10,000 protesters as part of a weekend-long rally.

""I’m locked into my own country right now,"" said Tom Pappin, an unvaccinated man who came from just outside Ottawa. ""I can’t go on a holiday. I can’t go to a restaurant, I can’t go bowling. I can’t go to a movie. You know, these are things that it’s just gotten out of control.""

The 52-year-old said attendees are likely to stay parked by Parliament until vaccine mandates are lifted.

Phil Haggart was among the group to counter-protest the convoy's message, saying he wanted to show that there were voices in favor of public health measures to slow the spread of the virus. ""Masks are important, vaccines are important, and mandates are important only because we need them to stay alive and not fill our hospitals up,"" he said as protesters rang cow bells close by.",https://www.foxnews.com/world/thousands-protest-covid-restrictions-ottawa,N/A
Thousands protest economic hardship in Sudan,"Thousands have taken to the streets in several Sudanese towns to protest economic hardship, especially higher bread prices, with a mob in the northern city of Atbara torching the ruling party's offices, activists said Thursday.

Photos and video clips posted by the activists on social media purported to show protests in several cities in Sudan, with demonstrators chanting anti-government slogans. A video clip obtained by The Associated Press late Wednesday showed the headquarters of President Omar Bashir's National Congress Party in Atbara engulfed in flames. Vehicles parked outside were also torched.

Authorities responded by declaring a state of emergency in the city and a nighttime curfew.

Protests broke out in the Red Sea city of Port Sudan, Barbar in the north and Nohoud in the western Kordofan region. There were no reports of clashes with security forces.

After weeks of shortages, authorities hiked the price of bread by three folds to about six U.S. cents, a move that is largely responsible for the latest wave of protests. The price of a range of basic items has significantly increased over the past year, pushing inflation rates up to at least 60 percent.

This week's protests coincided with the return to Sudan of opposition leader Sadeq al-Mahdi, the country's last freely elected leader, whose government was overthrown in a 1989 military coup led by Bashir. Al-Mahdi was living in self-imposed exile outside Sudan for nearly a year. Thousands of his supporters welcomed him home on Wednesday.

Addressing supporters, al-Mahdi proposed the formation of a national unity government to tackle the country's chronic economic problems and the internal displacement of Sudanese as a result of violence.

The protests also follow the start of a campaign by lawmakers loyal to Bashir to rally support to amend the constitution to allow the Sudanese leader, in power for nearly three decades, to run for re-election in 2020.

The Sudanese leader was indicted in 2010 by the International Criminal Court for genocide during the conflict in Sudan's western Darfur region which began in 2003 and is blamed for at least 200,000 deaths.

Sudan's economy has struggled for most of the 29 years Bashir has been in power. The situation has rapidly deteriorated since the secession of the south of the country in 2011, which deprived Khartoum of the oilfields there.

In the hope of securing aid and investments, Bashir has in recent years moved closer to oil-rich Gulf Arab nations, especially Saudi Arabia. He has deployed Sudanese troops in Yemen to fight alongside a Saudi-led coalition backing the government there against Iran-aligned rebels.",https://www.foxnews.com/world/thousands-protest-economic-hardship-in-sudan,N/A
Turkey says Swedish decision not to probe Kurd protest 'absurd',"Turkey on Tuesday denounced as ""absurd"" a decision by a Swedish prosecutor not to open an investigation into a protest by Kurds in central Stockholm where an effigy of the Turkish president was hung from a lamppost.

Last week’s protest outside Stockholm City Hall drew an angry backlash from Turkey, a NATO member which has been holding off on approving Sweden’s application to join the military alliance until the Swedish government cracks down on groups that Ankara regards as security threats. Turkey summoned the Swedish ambassador and canceled a visit by the speaker of the Swedish parliament in reaction to the incident.

In Sweden, a newspaper reported that a prosecutor has decided not to open a criminal investigation into the hanging of an effigy of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Stockholm, saying no illegal act was committed. District Attorney Lucas Eriksson told Sweden’s tabloid Aftonbladet about the decision.

But Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu disagreed, saying the protest amounted to racism and hate crime.

TURKEY DEMANDS NATO HOPEFULS 'HAND OVER YOUR TERRORISTS' BEFORE IT APPROVES MEMBERSHIP: REPORT

""The decision to not investigate made by the (Swedish) prosecution is extremely absurd,"" Cavusoglu said during a joint news conference with the visiting Iranian foreign minister. ""This was a racist incident which consists of hate crimes. Therefore (the decision to not prosecute, investigate) is also against universal law and is a crime under international law.""

""If Sweden thinks it is stringing us along with these word games, I’d like to say they’re kidding themselves,"" he said.

Alarmed by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Sweden and Finland dropped their longstanding policies of military nonalignment and applied to join NATO in May. All 30 member countries must agree to admit the two Nordic neighbors into the security organization.

The Turkish government has pressed Finland and Sweden to crack down on Kurdish exiles it accuses of links to the banned Kurdistan Workers’ Party and groups it considers to be terrorist organizations, and to extradite people suspected of terror-related crimes. Cavusoglu said last month that Sweden was not even ""halfway"" through addressing his country’s concerns.

Photographs posted on social media showed a mannequin resembling Erdogan hanging upside down. A group calling itself the Swedish Solidarity Committee for Rojava claimed it was behind the protest. Rojava is a Kurdish name for north and east Syria.

Last week, Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson called the protest as an act of ""sabotage"" against Sweden’s bid to join NATO.

Turkey will oppose Sweden's membership in NATO after Stockholm protest sees Quran burned,"Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says his country will oppose Sweden's bid to join NATO, citing pro-Kurdish protests in Stockholm this weekend.

Turkey has long faulted Sweden for its tolerance of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, a group Turkey, the U.S. and the E.U. have condemned as a terrorist organization. Rasmus Paludan, a Swedish politician, burned a Quran outside the Turkish embassy during a protest this weekend, and the PKK joined other pro-Kurdish groups in a separate protest.

""It is clear that those who allowed such vileness to take place in front of our embassy can no longer expect any charity from us regarding their NATO membership application,"" Erdogan said Monday. ""So you will let terror organizations run wild on your avenues and streets and then expect our support for getting into NATO. That’s not happening.""

""They won’t see any support from us on the NATO issue,"" unless Sweden begins respecting Turkey's views, he added.

Sweden and Finland were invited to seek NATO membership in 2022 following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Each new member must be approved by unanimous consent, however, and Turkey is the sole country opposing Sweden's membership.

The PKK has been operating as an insurgent group in northern Syria harassing Turkey for decades.

Sweden announced changes to its anti-terror laws in an attempt to address Turkey's concerns in June 2022, but Erdogan was not satisfied.

Erdogan demanded last week that Sweden deport roughly 130 PKK members that he has deemed terrorists.

""We said look, so if you don't hand over your terrorists to us, we can't pass it [approval of the NATO application] through the parliament anyway,"" Erdogan said at the time. ""For this to pass the parliament, first of all, you have to hand more than 100, around 130 of these terrorists, to us.""

WATCH: China censors struggled with surge of protest videos; protesters learning 'sophisticated' loopholes,"Videos posted across social media show not only Chinese residents' anger with their government over strict COVID-19 policies but also a rare lack of control from Beijing over media that exposes the weaknesses in the country.

""It has been a very interesting week for China watchers,"" Craig Singleton, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and an expert on China, told Fox News Digital. ""What we have seen in China this last week is very much akin to a ‘cat and mouse’ game between Chinese netizens and Chinese censors.""

Chinese citizens have turned out in the boldest rejection of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and its policies due to years of ""zero COVID,"" a system that Beijing employed in order to contain the coronavirus wherever it appeared.

Officials enforced days of lockdown and widespread testing when just a few cases of COVID-19 appeared in any city and moved residents to quarantine facilities if they tested positive for the virus – even asymptomatic cases.

PROTESTS IN CHINA ARE ABOUT MUCH MORE THAN COVID LOCKDOWNS

The protocols may have even played a part in the tragic deaths of 10 people who were trapped in their apartment building while it burned. Video showed some residents hanging out of their windows and off ledges to try and escape.

The building had remained under a partial lockdown for almost two months, prompting many to blame ""zero COVID"" for the tragedy and setting off the greatest pushback against the CCP in years as videos posted to social media showed citizens clashing with police during protests in the streets.

WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT

The flood of videos proved difficult for Chinese censors to control, with many of the videos appearing on Twitter and other Western platforms. The task proved so difficult that China reportedly spammed Twitter with posts about porn and escorts to make it difficult for users to find protest videos when they searched for cities by name.

CHINA EASING ‘ZERO-COVID’ POLICY A ‘RARE DISPLAY OF WEAKNESS’ FROM XI JINPING, TIANANMEN SQUARE PROTESTER SAYS

""Chinese censors have been overwhelmed by a barrage of so-called ‘illegal’ content several times over the last year, for instance, after isolated bank protests in several Chinese provinces,"" Singleton explained. ""There was also a groundswell of intense online activity in places like Shanghai after draconian lockdowns began taking their toll on the population.""

""In these and other cases, censors proved incapable, at least initially, of blocking much of this content – there simply was too much of it,"" he added.

Singleton also noted that Chinese citizens have developed a greater literacy with using virtual private networks (VPNs) – a program that hides a user's location from internet services – and similar methods to evade the ""Great Firewall"" of China.

""VPNs allow them to post messages, videos and other materials on Western platforms, like Twitter and even Instagram,"" he said. ""In some cases, citizens are taking screenshots of posts they see online before they are deleted by censors and then sharing them with each other or posting them on Western platforms.""

CHINA DEPLOYS RIOT POLICE IN HAZMAT SUITS TO CRACK DOWN ON COVID PROTESTS

In each case, the issue – and China’s attempt to combat it – came down to a problem with volume, which speaks to how widespread the protests grew and in such a short period of time. Jacqueline Deal, co-founder of the American Academy for Strategic Education (AASE), told Fox News Digital that the Chinese government may have been ""shell-shocked"" by the sheer scale of the protests, which delayed their response to the videos and other content.

""I think everyone was surprised by the fact that in a very short period of time there were demonstrations in such a large number of cities and on such a large number of campuses,"" Deal said. ""So I think it's difficult to see where this could go.""

A former Chinese censor told the New York Times that Beijing would need to hire more censors and develop more sophisticated algorithms to cut off the flood of videos reaching the West. Deal noted that the algorithm would also require time to develop and learn what to recognize and what actions to take against offending content, which also presents and opportunity for protesters in the near-term.

But U.S. intelligence suggests that the protests are unlikely to spread across the whole of the country: a U.S. government communication obtained by Politico describes the protests as disorganized and leaderless, indicating they would more than likely fizzle out.

BIDEN MUTE AS PROTESTS DEMAND FREEDOM AROUND THE WORLD

Deal argued that it’s hard to see how things will go, which makes it all the more important that the U.S. determines whether it will and how it can support the protests.

""The question for the administration is and for members of Congress is: What kind of expressions of solidarity do they want to make?"" Deal continued. ""For the tech firms and the people with technical expertise: What kind of contributions do they want to make?""

The protesters have made sure to take full advantage of their opportunities by developing more nuanced tactics, such as the ""blank paper"" protests, which involve the user posting a picture of a blank page and tagging the post with keywords that would otherwise evade the censors like ""good,"" ""yes"" and ""correct.""

WATCH: Chinese anti-COVID lockdown protest betrays frustration with severe measures,"Video allegedly from Guangzhou in China shows demonstrators breaking down barriers as they protest against the nation's severe COVID-19 lockdown policy.

In a video posted by Disclose.tv, hundreds of people march down the street, kicking aside barriers and chanting. At one point, people turn around and run back the other way, kicking over what barriers remain standing.

China has maintained a strict policy called zero-COVID in which it would shut down entire cities with only a few cases of COVID-19 detected in order to identify and isolate any infected individuals. The treatment of those individuals has bordered on inhumane.

Officials ordered the arrests of nine lockdown enforcers in the Shandong province who had beaten a resident, who refused to comply with orders, after a video captured the incident and went viral online.

""The public security force will severely crack down on illegal and criminal acts that infringe upon citizens' personal safety and other legitimate rights and interests in accordance with the law, and spare no effort to maintain social harmony and stability,"" the police said in a statement.

Last week, officials reaffirmed their commitment to the policy, saying prevention measures must not be relaxed.

When will the Freedom Convoy protest end?,"Canadian truckers protesting in Ottawa told Fox News they have no plans on leaving anytime soon.

""I plan on staying here until I get my freedom back,"" Canadian truck driver Adrien de Medeiros, who has been in Ottawa since the protest began in late January, told Fox News.

WATCH:

Wednesday marked the 13th day of protests in Ottawa where truck drivers are advocating for an end to the government's vaccine mandate for cross-border truckers. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has demanded the protests end.

Trucker Dave Alderton, who has also been in Ottawa since the first day of the ""Freedom Convoy"" protest, set up a mailbox on the back of his truck, though, he said the Post Office is having trouble recognizing his address.

Ottawa Police have issued more than 1,300 tickets since the beginning of the occupation. Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson asked Trudeau and Ontario Premier Doug Ford on Monday for 1,800 additional police officers to ""quell the insurrection that the Ottawa Police Service is not able to contain.""

Trudeau said Monday that ""hundreds of [Royal Canadian Mounted Police] officers have been mobilized to support the Ottawa Police Services. We're also working with municipal partners to further strengthen our response.""
