"Jennifer Lopez, Alex Rodriguez spotted kissing in Dominican Republic after split rumors","Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez appear to have snuffed rumors of a split.

Last week, reports indicated that the 51-year-old multihyphenate and former baseball pro, 45, had ended their engagement after several years together.

Not long after, the two offered a statement to Fox News that said, ""All the reports are inaccurate.""

""We are working through some things,"" the statement continued.

JENNIFER LOPEZ, ALEX RODRIGUEZ REUNITE IN THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: REPORT

Just days ago, it was reported that Rodriguez had flown to the Dominican Republic, where Lopez is currently filming a movie.

In photos obtained by Daily Mail, the pair could be seen sharing a smooch outdoors while the actress lounged in a white bathrobe.

In other photos, Lopez appears to happily greet Rodriguez upon his arrival and even wraps her arm around him as he kneels down to her level.

A source also recently told People magazine that Lopez ""was excited to see"" Rodriguez ""in person"" ahead of their DR reunion.

""They are really trying to figure things out,"" the source added. ""It was a happy reunion.""

A source further claimed to Fox News that, while reports of their breakup were premature, the two have recently run into some issues.

""Nothing was concrete. They hit a rough patch but are working through it,"" the source said.

An initial report from Page Six claimed Lopez was busy in the Dominican Republic filming a movie while Rodriguez is ""in Miami getting ready for baseball season.""

Rycroft elaborated via a rep that she “has had major stomach issues since returning from the Dominican Republic.”

“She got an upset stomach on the second day of vacation, but it passed. Once they came home, she got severe cramping,” the rep said. “It has lasted for over a week, and she’s currently getting tested for possible parasites and any other infections. She’s assuming it’s something foodborne, but no one else in her family is ill.”

On Tuesday, Tracy McCraw, of Madison, Miss., told The Post that she was on a flight full of sick passengers on her way home from Punta Cana.

Dominican Republic doctor helps impoverished community he grew up in: 'God answered my prayers',"Today, Dr. Jose Frank Piña, 30, has a wife and a daughter in his native Dominican Republic. He is a medical missionary who shares medical advice every Saturday on television.

But when he was growing up in an impoverished community, none of this seemed possible.

Piña grew up in the city of San Juan, in a home that had just two rooms, sharing a bed with two siblings, in an area ravaged by gang violence and frequent flooding.

At 4 years old, he was registered in a local church's Compassion International, a Christian sponsor program center where he received medical care, nutrition and vocational courses like English and computers.

""When I was a child living in a dangerous environment where gangs used to fight with machetes and guns, the letters from my sponsors helped me see a different reality of the world,"" Piña told Fox News. ""We saw hope.""

He added: ""I thank God for Compassion because being a kid in poverty, you can't have dreams or sometimes you have dreams but you can't make them come true because of the needs you have. They gave me the opportunity to dream and make those dreams come true.""

Speaking to Fox News from the hospital where he works now, Piña shared how he is helping others in his community break the cycle of poverty.

""I am trying to help others, not only to restore their physical health but to restore their spiritual health and help restore their relationship with God,"" he said.

It was through Compassion that he met his wife, Yaneli, also a doctor. The two met in high school and they got to know each other better during a Compassion trip.

Today they work as medical missionaries helping different communities in the area through their church, called ""Jehova Fuerte y Valiente.""

Dominican Republic confirms 1st coronavirus case cruise denied entry,"Health officials in the Dominican Republic on Sunday reported the first confirmed case of the new coronavirus in the tourist-rich Caribbean, a 62-year-old Italian citizen.

Public Health Minister Rafael Sánchez Cárdenas said the man had arrived in the country on Feb. 22 without showing symptoms. He was being treated in isolation at a military hospital and “has not shown serious complications.”

The announcement came shortly before the Braemar cruise ship that had been denied entry to the Dominican Republic due to the virus fears apparently at last found a place to dock — the Dutch territory of St. Maarten.

Fred. Olsen Cruise Lines said at least some of the passengers would be flown to Britain aboard chartered airliners. Other passengers, who had been scheduled to board the vessel on Friday in the Dominican Republic, were being flown to St. Maarten to embark there.

Dominican officials had barred the ship due to reports that a few of those aboard had a flu-like illness, but the cruise line said none had symptoms consistent with the new virus.

It was one of at least three cruise ships turned away from Caribbean ports over the past week due to concerns over possible viral infections, though no passengers on any of the ships has been confirmed to have the disease.

What to know about pesticide poisoning in wake of Dominican Republic lawsuit,"Last year, Kaylynn Knull and Tom Schwander were enjoying a relaxing vacation in the Dominican Republic when the couple started experiencing alarming symptoms. Now the two have filed a $1 million lawsuit against the resort called The Grand Bahia Principe La Romana.

The couple is seeking restoration for their experiences in the wake of 3 more American deaths that occurred there that same week.

TOXICOLOGIST SAYS A COLORLESS, ODORLESS 'INTOXICANT' COULD BE CAUSE OF DOMINICAN REPUBLIC DEATHS

According to The Sun, Knull and Schwander woke up one morning after several days at the resort, suffering from dizziness, blurred vision, drooling and stomach cramps among other symptoms.

After flying home, doctors suspected pesticide poisoning, specifically from organophosphates. That diagnosis aligned with many of their symptoms.

Knull now wonders if chemicals sprayed on plants outside the resort’s rooms were to blame, reports The Sun in an interview with the couple. Knull and Schwander wanted the resort to state the name of the chemicals used in its gardening. The two filed a lawsuit after the resort refused.

Unfortunately, last year’s cases aren’t the only episodes of tourist illness in the Dominican Republic. Investigations are ongoing for 11 recent deaths. The FBI and CDC are also investigating.

The cause of these deaths are still unknown. But media and the tourists involved speculate they could be related to harmful pesticides, spiked alcohol or tainted food.

The Problem of Pesticide Poisoning

In the United States, pesticide poisoning often happens to residents and workers around farming regions. However, the World Health Organization recognizes that poisoning does occur more often in developing countries.

DAUGHTER OF ARMY VET WHO DIED AT DOMINICAN RESORT: FUNERAL HOME 'PRESSURED' ME TO MAKE A DECISION ABOUT MY FATHER'S REMAINS

Studies in Central American countries like El Salvador and Nicaragua have shown poisonings to occur twice as much in the general population as in America’s agricultural population. That amounts to 35 cases per 100,000 versus the United States’ 18 cases in the farming community, states WHO.

However, it’s difficult to pinpoint an exact number because of lack of surveillance, long-term side effects, and inconsistent study methods.

Since millions of U.S. tourists visit areas like the Dominican Republic every year, this situation could truly happen to anyone. According to The Sun, 2.7 million Americans visit the resort where Knull and Schwander stayed last June.

Signs of Pesticide Poisoning

The big takeaway is that Americans should understand pesticide poisoning and take precautions against it, especially when traveling out of the country.

Pesticides can fall into several different categories. Those include organophosphates, carbamates, and pyrethrins or pryethroids, the last of which are considered natural pesticides.

Common symptoms you should watch for:

Abdominal cramping

Blurred vision

Chest tightness

Diarrhea or incontinence

Dizziness

Drooling

Eye irritation or tearing

Fluid-filled lungs

Headache

Muscle weakness or lack of coordination

Nausea

Seizures

Sensitivity to light or sound

Shortness of breath

Slow or irregular heartbeat

Slurred speech

Sweating

Tingling or numbness

Vomiting

If you experience any of the above symptoms after traveling to agricultural or international regions, you should seek medical help immediately.

What to Expect with Pesticide Poisoning Treatment

If you suspect pesticide poisoning, you should get medical help for even mild symptoms like headache or dizziness. Pesticide poisoning can have long-term effects that your doctor might help to improve.

For more serious cases, your doctor might prescribe medications to help with symptoms and an IV to hydrate and clear your body of toxins.

Because poisoning symptoms can escalate quickly, you should contact emergency help if you suspect a high level of exposure.

Bottom Line

Pesticide poisoning happens in the US and even more often in developing countries where pesticides are less regulated. In the midst of planning your exciting international vacation, watch for concerning news reports beforehand and stay on guard for poisoning symptoms while you’re abroad.",https://www.foxnews.com/health/pesticide-poisoning-dominican-republic-lawsuit,N/A
Banana Republic customers threaten to boycott after discounted orders are canceled,"More than a few Banana Republic shoppers are angry with the retailer after the store failed to honor a $50-off promotion on Tuesday morning.

According to a shopper who spoke with Fox News, the coupon site Dan’s Deals posted a Banana Republic promotional code promising “$50 off $50 at Banana Republic” by using the code BRSHOP at checkout. It effectively allowed shoppers to order anything — even items that only amounted to $50.01 — for $50 off.

ANTHROPOLOGIE ACCIDENTALLY LISTS $8,000 COUCH FOR FREE, CANCELS ALL ORDERS

Commenters on Dan’s Deals soon confirmed the news, with one alleging that he/she ordered a pair of $58 velvet slippers for just $7 after pairing the promo code with her GapCard discount. Another said he/she got shirts, a belt and a merino wool sweater totally free — and shipped free, too — thanks to the deal.

By 9:45 a.m. on Tuesday, however, the site reported that the deal was “dead,” and more than a few Banana Republic shoppers were informed via email that their orders were canceled, with no explanation given.

“I just got an email that my order has been canceled,” wrote one Dan’s Deals user.

“My order was canceled, said another. “I called them and was told that it was a mistake [and] you needed a $200 order to get the $50 off.”

The shopper who spoke with Fox News added that she tried to re-order her items after her order was canceled, but that BRSHOP coupon code no longer worked.

Angry customers took to Twitter to vent their frustrations with the retailer, with some adding that they no longer planned on giving Banana Republic their business.

It’s currently unclear if Banana Republic canceled all orders placed with the coupon code. A representative for the company was not immediately available to comment.

Banana Republic isn’t the first major retailer to cancel orders after an errant online deal was embraced by shoppers.

"Banana Republic manager said employee’s braids were too ‘urban’ and ‘unkempt’ for store’s image, woman claims","A Banana Republic employee from New York is claiming she was “humiliated and degraded” by a manager who said her hair was too inappropriate for the workplace.

Destiny Tompkins, 19, took to Facebook last week to recount the incident, which took place after a district manager came to visit her Banana Republic location in White Plains, N.Y.

MOM'S PICS SHOW WHY DAUGHTER STRUGGLES TO ADHERE TO SCHOOL DRESS CODE

“So today I went into work at Banana Republic at the Westchester Mall and after the district manager (a white woman) popped in for a visit, I was told to go to the office to speak with my manager,” wrote Tompkins in a Facebook post on Wednesday evening.

She then explained that she expected her store manager, a white man named Michael, to tell her something was wrong with her outfit. But instead, he began questioning her about her box-braid hairstyle, she says.

“He told me that my braids were not Banana Republic appropriate and that they were too ‘urban’ and ‘unkempt’ for their image,” wrote Tompkins, adding that Michael told her he couldn’t allow her to work until she changed her hairstyle.

Tompkins tried to explain how the braids keep her hair from drying out, but she alleges that Michael simply recommended she start using shea butter, and sent her back out to the floor.

“I have never been so humiliated and degraded in my life by a white person,” Tompkins wrote. “In that moment, I felt so uncomfortable and overwhelmed that I didn’t even finish my work shift and ended up leaving.”

MALE STUDENTS WEAR OVER-THE-SHOULDER TOPS TO PROTEST SCHOOL DRESS CODE

“Box braids are not a matter of unprofessionalism, they are protective styles black women have used for their hair and to be discriminated against because of it is truly disgusting and unacceptable,” she added. “Make this public bc [the people at Banana Republic] need to be exposed for their blatant racism and discrimination. There’s no reason why a white person should feel allowed to tell me that I can’t wear my hair the way that I want bc it’s too black for their store image.”

Tompkins’ post has since been shared more than 51,000 times. She’s also been praised by supporters, one of whom suggested Tompkins take action against the company.

Tompkins’ mother, Jess Fig, later thanked the supporters in her own Facebook post.

On Friday, New York's WABC obtained a statement from Banana Republic, who wrote that they plan to investigate.

""We are committed to upholding an inclusive environment where our customers and our employees feel respected,"" the company wrote.

Destiny also appeared on WABC to discuss the matter further, and stated that it was the district manager who told Michael to talk to her about the braids. The station also said that Tompkins and her mother are pursuing legal action.

Connecticut woman delivers baby on flight to Dominican Republic: What pregnant travelers should know,"A woman from Connecticut who gave birth on a flight to the Dominican Republic in September has returned to U.S. earlier this month after getting an emergency passport for her newborn.

Kendria Rhoden of Hartford delivered her son Skylen on an American Airlines flight, according to a series of viral TikTok videos her sister, Kendalee Rhoden, posted, which have garnered millions of views.

Kendria Rhoden and her child were able to board a return flight home in early October, according to the TikTok videos posted.

BABY NAMES THAT ARE REPORTEDLY BANNED IN AMERICA: WHAT TO KNOW

""On Sept. 8, American Airlines flight 2443 from New York (JFK) to Punta Cana (PUJ) declared an emergency before landing due to a medical emergency on board,"" an American Airlines representative wrote to Fox News Digital in an email.

""First responders met the flight upon landing and the customer was taken to a local hospital for further evaluation. We thank our team members and medical professionals on board for their professionalism and quick action,"" the airline rep continued.

Rhoden and her sister shared TikTok videos of Skylen’s red emergency passport and both videos have drawn questions from curious social media users who want to know what it’s like to give birth while traveling internationally.

Fox News Digital reached out to Rhoden for comment. It's unclear as to how far along she was in her pregnancy.

Here’s what pregnant women should know before making long-distance travel plans and what needs to be done if, by chance, they give birth in the sky, in international waters or in a foreign country.

What to know about emergency passports and other documents?

New mothers who give birth on a plane or boat while traveling internationally have to report the birth to the U.S. embassy or consulate in the country of their arrival, according to Dr. Jessica Madden, medical director at Aeroflow Breastpumps, a breast pump distributor based in Asheville, North Carolina.

Embassies and consulates will issue a Consular Record of Birth Abroad (CRBA) form, which will need to be filled out to prove a newborn’s citizenship status.

""As long as you are a U.S. citizen, your baby will also be a U.S. citizen, no matter where he or she is born,"" Madden said. ""Certain countries will offer dual citizenship if the plane was flying over their country when you gave birth, but others will not.""

UKRAINE, A LEADING SURROGACY DESTINATION, IS CAUGHT AMID WAR: WHAT TO KNOW

CBRAs take approximately 15 business days to process, according to the U.S. Embassy & Consulate government website.

Passports are required for international travel and reentering the country.

The U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Consular Affairs handles emergency passport processing, including life-or-death emergency appointments that require international travel within three days and urgent travel appointments that require international travel within 14 days.

""Newborns who are born abroad do need to have an emergency U.S. passport issued to be able to enter the U.S., unless they are born on a cruise that both leaves from and returns to the U.S. [in a] closed loop,"" Madden said.

WOMAN GIVES BIRTH ON 11-HOUR UNITED AIRLINES FLIGHT

CBRAs and emergency passport applications for newborns are usually processed at the same time, according to Madden.

She noted that newborns must be present during these document appointments, which is a requirement that could delay the process if a baby isn’t quickly discharged from a hospital.

""There is a potential that your stay might need to be extended by several weeks,"" Madden warned.

Madden noted that expecting mothers who need to travel internationally during their third trimester should check obstetric care terms with their health insurer to see if a birth abroad will be covered.

Pregnancy complications associated with preterm birth - Pre-eclampsia - Gestational diabetes - Cervical incompetence

""I recommend having a copy of your pregnancy medical record readily available. This is important information to have with you if you give birth in a foreign country,"" Madden said. ""You should try to plan ahead of time where you will seek medical treatment if you go into labor or develop an unforeseen pregnancy complication.""

FLORIDA WOMAN, 8 MONTHS PREGNANT, POLESPEARS FISH FOR POTENTIAL WORLD RECORD CATCH

Women who have pregnancy complications that are associated with a higher risk of preterm birth should avoid traveling internationally during the entire third trimester, according to Madden.

What are the logistics of traveling while pregnant?

Airlines and cruise lines have a ""no-travel deadline for pregnant passengers,"" according to Sandra McLemore, a travel industry expert and television host with 22 years of experience, who currently contributes to Travel Marketing and Media, a California-based travel business firm.

""Within the airline industry, it can vary between domestic airlines and international airlines,"" McLemore told Fox News Digital.

""If, for example, you were flying to Europe for your babymoon, you'd need to check each airline. Getting across the pond and then being denied boarding to your next destination would be terrible,"" she continued.

Cruise lines, on the other hand, are known to adjust their own rules depending on the itinerary, according to McLemore.

""The risks are higher when a ship has a significant number of sea days away from land,"" she said. ""Typically, you'll see earlier pregnancy deadlines on transatlantic or transpacific routes.""

CAN YOU TAKE PRENATAL VITAMINS WHEN YOU'RE NOT PREGNANT?

McLemore said pregnant women should follow the advice an obstetrician gives before making travel plans.

Doctors may approve of short trips or outright advise against travel (domestically and internationally), especially when mothers are in a later stage of pregnancy, McLemore noted.

""At the end of the day, a healthy baby and healthy mother are the focus,"" she said.

If travel while pregnant can’t be avoided for whatever reason, McLemore said expecting mothers should consult a travel insurance company – provided that they have one.

BABY FORMULA SHORTAGE: WHICH FOODS AND TECHNIQUES BOOST BREAST MILK PRODUCTION?

""Most travel insurance policies do not cover any form of pregnancy complications, which means that if you require medical treatment or repatriation, you could be hundreds of thousands of dollars out of pocket,"" McLemore warned.

What do doctors want pregnant women to know about travel?

The ""best time to travel during pregnancy"" is between 14 and 28 weeks, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), a Washington, D.C.-based professional association of obstetric physicians.

The group notes that ""mid-pregnancy"" is the best time for expecting mothers to travel because morning sickness and energy levels generally improve.

""You are still able to get around easily,"" the group wrote in a travel information guide. ""After 28 weeks, it may be harder to move around or sit for a long time.""

CAN YOU TAKE PRENATAL VITAMINS WHEN YOU'RE NOT PREGNANT?

The ACOG urges pregnant women to consult their obstetrician before travel and to be wary of travel if they’re experiencing pregnancy complications.

Why are air and sea travel a concern?

Dr. Kellie Lease Stecher, an obstetrician at Minnesota Women's Care, a healthcare center in Maplewood, Minnesota, said each pregnancy is unique and therefore recommendations can vary when it comes down to travel.

""If an individual is in their first trimester, but [they're] having bleeding concerns, it would be best to stay home. However, patients can travel internationally until 32 weeks,"" Stecher told Fox News Digital.

WOMAN GIVES BIRTH ON FRONTIER AIRLINES FLIGHT, GIVES DAUGHTER FITTING NAME

Some airlines require letters from a physician before they allow pregnant women board, Stecher noted.

""The concern about planes or cruises, is the inability to easily get off and go to a hospital,"" she explained, ""If you’re in the air and have an emergency, there are limited tools at your disposal.""

Stecher doesn’t recommend international travel for expecting mothers who are nearing term.

If travel can’t be avoided, she suggests mothers-to-be contact the country they’re visiting to ""see what they do legally.""

Having the information ready can help to make a backup or emergency birthing plan.

What are the risks of traveling while pregnant?

Dr. Wendy Goodall McDonald, an obstetrician-gynecologist at Women's Health Consulting, a healthcare center in Chicago, said she advises ""low-risk"" patients to avoid international travel in their third trimester and ""high-risk"" patients to stop traveling earlier than that.

""If there is a complication, not only is the pregnant person subject to whatever health system is present where they are, but if the baby were to be born early, they now have a preterm newborn who has to remain in that health system until they are old enough to be discharged, which could be months,"" Goodall McDonald told Fox News Digital.

""The same is true earlier than the third trimester, but statistically, complications are less likely to occur in the second trimester or earlier,"" she added.

Traveling for extended periods – four hours or more – with restricted movement while pregnant also puts women at risk of developing a blood clot, or deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which can be life-threatening, according to Goodall McDonald.

She said expecting mothers should ""get up and move every two to four hours"" to lower their chance of developing blood clots.

""Cruises often have medical personnel present, but there may be limitations to where further care will occur if needed,"" Goodall McDonald said. ""Air travel will allow a person to get to a destination faster than a car or bus in the event that acute care is needed, but if driving or riding a train or bus is the only option, the pregnant person should be aware of what hospitals or health systems are along their route if needed.""

Denny's Comes to the Dominican Republic,"Denny’s has arrived in the Dominican Republic.

The Spartanburg, South Carolina-based diner chain has opened its first Dominican store in the third floor food court of Santo Domingo’s Las Americas International Airport.

The store is Denny’s first airport location.

It is not, however, Denny’s first location in Latin America. The company already has three stores each in Costa Rica and Honduras, along with five in Mexico and 12 in Puerto Rico.

The store was opened by franchisee Grupo Nahas.

""We are proud to bring Denny's to the Dominican Republic,"" said Leonardo Nahas, Grupo Nahas’ general director, in a statement.

The family restaurant chain is known for staying open 24 hours a day and for its hearty breakfast meals like the Grand Slamwich and Moons Over My Hammy.

Hotel look: The Jimmy Buffett resort in the Dominican Republic,"As temperatures dip it may be easy to start reminiscing about summer's warm weather days.

The Margaritaville Island Reserve Cap Cana in the Dominican Republic is the most recent of Jimmy Buffett's resorts around the world, and it appears to be designed for laid-back luxury.

Located on the white-sand Jaunillo Beach and a quick flight from many U.S. cities, it's a 20-minute ride from Punta Cana International Airport to the resort.

The all-inclusive Margaritaville Island Reserve Cap Cana boasts a 4.5 out of 5 — or ""Excellent"" rating on TripAdvisor.

From the 5 o’Clock Somewhere bar to the St. Somewhere Spa to the LandShark Brewery, the theme is entirely Buffett — complete with complimentary flip-flops.

‘FRIENDS’-THEMED AIRBNB OPENS IN TAMPA BAY

The resort, owned by the Karisma brand, is home to 10 restaurants and five bars, including the only LandShark Brewery and Grill outside the U.S.

There's also a steakhouse named for Buffett himself, plus Frank & Lola's Italian Trattoria (back from their second honeymoon in Pensacola) and RumRunners, among others.

Room service is available 24 hours each day.

There are three pools and 519 suites, among them 40 villas.

Recently added is a private adults-only section named Hammock within the resort that includes an adults-only pool, restaurant and bar.

But the most sought-after room — and the most expensive — is the Jimmy Buffett Suite.

The premier suite at Margaritaville Island Reserve Cap Cana features a large balcony with Caribbean Sea views, a private bar, a chef's kitchen and a dining table for 10 — intended for dinner parties planned with the resort's private chef.

Meet the American who wrote 'The Battle Hymn of the Republic',"Julia Ward Howe (1819-1910) gave the United States — and the world — some of the most inspirational words ever written.

She penned ""The Battle Hymn of the Republic"" in November 1861, during a wartime tour of Washington, D.C., as Americans realized with gloom that the seven-month-old Civil War would be longer, darker and deadlier than anticipated.

Howe's masterpiece has been called America's fight song. Its lyrics inspired the United States to spiritual resolve and sacrifice.

The words tell the biblically heroic story of Union soldiers marching to their death in the name of Christ to vanquish slavery:

As he died to make men holy

Let us die to make men free

His truth is marching on

FDR’S POWERFUL PRAYER UNITED AMERICANS ON D-DAY

The lyrics are often altered in modern performances to ""let us live to make men free."" Yet some 360,000 federal soldiers, according to the American Battlefield Trust, answered the call to martyrdom in the name of human liberty. Their sacrifice freed 4 million Americans from bondage. Hundreds of thousands of Confederate soldiers died in the conflict, too.

The ""glory, glory hallelujah"" chorus of ""The Battle Hymn"" is today one of the most familiar refrains in world music.

But many people have forgotten the rest of the tune and its impassioned Christian call to arms — even willfully erased it in certain circles of the American political spectrum. Many recent accounts of the song gloss over its foundations.

Howe’s imagery is unmistakable, though; the song was deeply informed by her literary Christian upbringing.

Flickering campfires in ""The Battle Hymn"" are the light of the Lord; encampments are altars where soldiers pray ""in the evening dews and damp""; glimmering bayonets formed for battle reflect the ""fiery Gospel."" Slavery is an Old Testament serpent to be crushed beneath the heel of Jesus Christ.

The song was deeply informed by Howe's literary Christian upbringing.

The famous second line — ""He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored"" — is a plea for divine justice inspired by the Book of Revelation. (John Steinbeck lifted the phrase ""The Grapes of Wrath"" straight from Howe's pen when naming his 1939 American epic novel.)

‘The word of the hour’

The song was a sensation, embraced by soldiers in the field and beloved by ordinary Americans, legendary performers and world leaders for 160 years.

""The Battle Hymn"" was ""sung, chanted, recited and used in exhortation of prayer on the eve of battle,"" Howe later wrote. ""It was the word of the hour, and the Union armies marched to its swing.""

MEET THE AMERICAN WOMAN WHO FOUNDED PEPPERIDGE FARM

The Mormon Tabernacle Choir won a Grammy and enjoyed its only chart hit with ""The Battle Hymn of the Republic"" in 1960.

Elvis Presley closed his glitzy late-career performances with his impassioned ""American Trilogy,"" featuring ""The Battle Hymn.""

Flag-waving Whitney Houston electrified sailors returning from the Gulf War with her spirited live version of ""The Battle Hymn"" in 1991, just months after her iconic Super Bowl performance of the national anthem.

Prime Minister Winston Churchill and President Ronald Reagan are among the song’s most famous fans.

Reagan was reduced to tears by the power of ""The Battle Hymn"" on Jan. 20, 1981, when the Mormon Tabernacle Choir performed it during his inauguration parade.

""In times of danger and thanksgiving, ‘The Battle Hymn’ is now, as it was in the [1860s], the fitting vehicle of the national feeling,"" Howe's daughter, Florence Howe Hall, wrote in her 1916 book, ""The Story of the Battle Hymn of the Republic.""

And in the days after 9/11, the nation instinctively rallied around ""The Battle Hymn"" in churches and in public performances, proving that the song speaks to the spirit of the American people through the ages.

Bright, inquisitive young woman

Julia Ward Howe was born May 27, 1819, in apparent comfort in New York City to Julia Rush Cutler and Samuel Ward III. Her mother was a published poet, her father a prominent Manhattan businessman.

Among other achievements, her father was one of the founders of what’s now known as New York University, as well as a leader of the New York Temperance Society, a devout Christian and a prominent fundraiser for the Episcopal Church, according to various sources.

She published poems and essays as a young person in her 20s.

Family wealth afforded the bright, inquisitive young woman access to literature and the great minds of her time. She published poems and essays as a young person in her 20s.

The Ward family descended from notable lineage that included several American patriots. The family traced its name to a Captain Ward of Normandy who accompanied William the Conquerer on his invasion of England in 1066, according to the 1917 Pulitzer Prize-winning biography, ""Julia Ward Howe,"" written by her daughters, Laura E. Richards, Maud Howe Elliott and Florence Howe Hall — who also wrote the book about the song itself.

AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL: 50 MUST-SEE LANDMARKS THAT TELL OUR NATIONAL STORY

John Ward, of Gloucester, England, the first of the family to arrive in America, was cavalry officer in Oliver Cromwell’s army in the late 1600s before settling in Newport, R.I. Julia's great-grandfather, Samuel Ward, was governor of the Rhode Island colony and a member of the Continental Congress. He died of smallpox in Philadelphia four months before America declared independence, his death at the Congress recorded by John Adams.

His son, Samuel Ward Jr., Julia's grandfather, was a hero of the American Revolution. He survived capture by the British and then the ""snows and starvation of the winter camp"" at Valley Forge alongside George Washington.

Julia Ward ""inherited many traits from the Wards, among them a force and integrity of purpose, a strength of character,"" her children wrote.

She married acclaimed Boston doctor Samuel Gridley Howe in 1843. Among other achievements, Howe in 1829 founded the Perkins School for the Blind, the first of its kind in the nation in Watertown, Mass. It's still in operation today.

Julia spent much of her adult life living in Boston while traveling overseas and dining with literary luminaries such as Charles Dickens.

Yet her marriage was troubled, unhappy and intellectually stifling for the spirited woman.

""Howe’s husband disapproved of her literary ambitions and dictated her behavior, but he also remained physically and emotionally distant,"" according to a National Park Service biography.

Howe, 18 years older than his wife, died in 1876, when Julia was just 56 years old. She painted her widowhood as a liberating event.

Howe ""began her new life today,"" she wrote the day after his funeral, making the most of living out the next 35 years on her own terms.

Julia Ward Howe inherited … a force and integrity of purpose, a strength of character.

Notably, she spent years as one of the leading voices for women's suffrage, while championing the role of mothers in American society. She was the first president of the New England Woman Suffrage Association and a key figure in the Boston-based American Woman Suffrage Association.

MEET THE AMERICAN WHO INVENTED THE MOTOR HOME

She penned an appeal in 1870, known as The Mother's Day Proclamation, inviting women around the world to unite for peace in the wake of the terrible human carnage of the Civil War.

""The mother has a sacred and commanding word to say to the sons who owe their life to her suffering,"" Howe, a mother of six, proclaimed. Her efforts helped lead to Mother's Day celebrations enjoyed around the world today.

‘Wished-for lines were arranging themselves’

Julia and her husband toured wartime Washington, D.C., in November 1861, with Dr. Howe on duty for the federal Sanitary Commission at a time when filth and disease were deadly issues in military camps. The writer enjoyed divine inspiration the night of Nov. 18, while staying at Willard's Hotel.

""I awoke the next morning in the gray of the early dawn, and to my astonishment found that the wished-for lines were arranging themselves in my brain,"" she later recorded. ""I began to scrawl the lines almost without looking … Having completed this, I lay down again and fell asleep, but not before feeling that something of importance had happened to me.""

She scribbled the lyrics on sheet paper from the Sanitary Commission. They were published four months later, in February 1862, in The Atlantic Monthly.

Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord

He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored

He hath loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible swift sword

His truth is marching on



Glory, glory, hallelujah!

Glory, glory, hallelujah!

Glory, glory, hallelujah!

His truth is marching on



I have seen Him in the watch-fires of a hundred circling camps,

They have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps;

I can read His righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps:

His day is marching on.

(Chorus)

I have read a fiery gospel writ in burnished rows of steel:

As ye deal with my condemners, so with you my grace shall deal

Let the hero, born of woman, crush the serpent with his heel

Since God is marching on

(Chorus)

He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat

He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment seat

Oh, be swift, my soul, to answer Him! Be jubilant, my feet!

Our God is marching on

(Chorus)

In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea

With a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me

As He died to make men holy, let us die to make men free

While God is marching on.

The tune is not her own. She wrote the lyrics to the music of the existing abolitionist song, ""John Brown’s Body,"" based on a popular folk melody — a version of which she heard performed by troops during her Washington, D.C., tour.

The response to her spirited new Christian anthem, among the public and in military camps, was immediate and overwhelming.

""Singing Chaplain"" Captain Charles Caldwell McCabe of Ohio was among those Union soldiers instantly spirited by the ""The Battle Hymn.""

""He was so charmed with the lines that he committed them to memory before arising from his chair,"" Hall wrote in her tome about her mother's song.

""The Battle Hymn"" inspired the chaplain a year later, in 1863, after he was taken prisoner and sent to brutal Libby Prison in Richmond, Va., where his ""wonderful voice was wont to dispel the gloom that often settled upon the inmates of the prison.""

""He was so charmed with the lines that he committed them to memory before arising from his chair.""

The hopeless conditions of the prison grew too heavy one July day. The men were forced to cast lots to decide two officers to be executed, while word filtered in from Confederate sources that the Union had been defeated at Gettysburg and repulsed at Vicksburg.

""A pall deeper than death itself settled upon the prisoners,"" Hall wrote. ""The poor, emaciated fellows broke down and cried like babies.""

Then, good news arrived. The stories of defeat were wrong. Their comrades had, in fact, won decisively at Gettysburg. The tide of war had turned in favor of the Union.

""Five hundred voices sang the chorus, Glory, glory hallelujah,' as men never sang before.""

Chaplain McCabe immediately leaped upon a box and began to sing: ""Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the lord.""

""Five hundred voices sang the chorus, ‘Glory, glory hallelujah,' as men never sang before,"" Hall wrote. The two Union officers meant to be executed celebrated, too. Their lives were spared amid the spontaneous prison outburst.

Captain McCabe would later write: ""No hymn has ever stirred the nation’s heart like ‘The Battle Hymn of the Republic.’""

National Women's Hall of Fame

Howe died of pneumonia on Oct. 17, 1910, at a home she kept in Portsmouth, R.I., now on the National Register of Historic Places. She was 91 years old.

Her contribution to American culture has been celebrated through the decades. She was the first women elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1908. She was in the inaugural class of the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970 alongside Irving Berlin, George Gershwin and W.C. Handy. And she was selected for the National Women's Hall of Fame in 1998.

Howe was honored in 1987 in the ""Great American Series"" of U.S. postage stamps.

Lighter versions of her song are spirited sports anthems around the globe.

""Glory, Glory"" is a beloved ritualistic tune for the University of Georgia football team dating back more than a century. Soccer fans sing joyous full-throated versions with altered lyrics, such as ""Glory, Glory Tottenham Hotspur,"" a tribute to the English Premier League power.

Howe's trumpet of Christian justice helped inspire greater causes — including the Civil Rights Movement, born in the pulpits of the South.

Its most notable figure was fire-and-brimstone Baptist minister Martin Luther King Jr., who led the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. MLK and his organization picked up the march for equality in the name of Christ where the nation had fallen short a century earlier.

King, just 39 years old, made his last soaring public speech on the night of April 3, 1968.

""I’m not worried about anything. I’m not fearing any man,"" bellowed the reverend with chilling conviction in his faith and his cause, after hinting at his fate.

""Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord!"" King thundered — then he turned and walked off the Memphis stage to delirious applause.

He was killed the next afternoon.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg's famous 'dissent' necklace sells out at Banana Republic before it even goes on sale,"Well, that was fast.

A limited-edition release of Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s iconic “dissent” collar-style necklaces have reportedly flown off Banana Republic’s online shelves before they even went on sale. The Supreme Court’s oldest justice has made headlines in recent weeks as she recovers from early-stage lung cancer.

Earlier this week, Banana Republic announced that they'd be reissuing a black, bib-like collar necklace with faux-jewel detailing that the ""Notorius RBG"" first made famous in 2012. The retailer said they that planned to “proudly” donate 50% of the purchase price to the ACLU’s Women's Rights Project – and the item quickly sold like a hotcake.

MEGHAN MARKLE MADE A 'CONSCIOUS EFFORT' TO NOT DRESS LIKE KATE MIDDLETON, SOURCE CLAIMS

“In just a few hours, we pre-sold all units of the necklace that were made in limited edition for January delivery. Given the overwhelming response, we are working quickly to create additional quantities,” reps for Banana Republic wrote on Instagram just one day later.

According to ABC, 85-year-old Ginsburg first received the stylish accessory from the VIP gift bag distributed at Glamour magazine’s “Women of the Year” gala in 2012 and has worn it many a time since.

“It looks fitting for dissents,” Ginsburg told Katie Couric of her so-called “dissenting” collar in a 2014 interview, as per ABC.

Famed for her accessorizing her black judicial robes with fancy collars, oversized eyeglasses, fishnet gloves, and scrunchies, the unlikely style icon and octogenarian has become somewhat revered by many millennial women.

As RBG fans cheer on her recovery, they’re also eager for the necklace to be available for sale again, too.

“I would be willing to pay triple the cost for this necklace. I want to know as soon as there are more in stock so that I can order,” one fan wrote on Instagram.

"Man proposes to his girlfriend underwater, during diving trip in Dominican Republic","This man didn’t just get down on one knee for his girl — he went 30-feet underwater.

Travis Grenier recently proposed to girlfriend Kenna Seitz during a diving trip in the Dominican Republic. Fortunately, she said yes, because nothing ruins a good diving experience like a broken heart.

Grenier spent months planning the proposal, SWNS reports. The couple, who live in Georgia, booked a trip to Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic. Grenier booked a boat, and made sure to sneak along his GoPro camera to capture the moment.

According to SWNS, Grenier was incredibly worried about losing the ring. So worried, in fact, that Seitz noticed he was acting oddly.

“Travis was insistent on wearing this fanny pack and I couldn’t understand why, but I just tried to forget about it,” Seitz told SWNS. “He even wore it into the water, which I thought was very weird, but I didn’t put two and two together.”

“The snuba was incredible, it is so beautiful down there. The instructor started to gesture for us to get together for a picture on our GoPro towards the end of the dive,” Seitz told SWNS. “I stood up and when I looked down Travis was on his knee holding a little treasure chest. I opened the box and it was the most beautiful treasure I could have imagined. I started screaming. It was the most special moment. We even kissed through our masks.”

Harris ripped for gaffe touting US ‘alliance with Republic of North Korea’: Kim Jong Un ‘is laughing at us',"Twitter users blasted Vice President Kamala Harris for her recent gaffe in which she claimed the U.S. has an ""alliance with the Republic of North Korea.""

Harris made the blunder while visiting the Demilitarized Zone between South Korea, the actual U.S. ally on the peninsula, and the People’s Republic of North Korea, the rogue state run by dictator Kim Jong Un.

The U.S. is still technically at war with North Korea as the Korean War ended with an armistice rather than a peace treaty in 1953.

While making a speech at the DMZ this week, Harris stated, ""So the United States shares a very important relationship, which is an alliance with the Republic of North Korea and it is an alliance that is strong an enduring.""

WHITE HOUSE CALLED OUT FOR COVER-UP OF BIDEN TELEPROMPTER GAFFE: ‘PAID TO LIE FOR A LIVING’

The blatantly obvious error caught the attention of Harris’ critics online, who weren’t willing to look the other way.

Conservative commentator John Cardillo lambasted the Biden administration after seeing this clip, tweeting, ""Let's just keep making believe these morons are remotely functional and not complete idiots.""

Former Trump 2020 press communications director Erin Perrine also slammed Harris within the context of Biden’s ""Where’s Jackie?"" gaffe from yesterday. She wrote, ""It is very obvious the VP misspoke here but it leads to a serious question, will the White House admit the mistake or double down like they did yesterday when it was clear Biden messed up big time calling out for a dead member of Congress?""

Podcast host Monica Crowley tweeted, ""Please tell me this is a deep fake.""

GOP communications expert Matt Whitlock tweeted, ""Between this and Biden’s chaotic Taiwan rhetoric and cleanup we are sending some very mixed signals into Asia. The only thing they’re likely clear about is that the Biden administration is a hot mess.""

Hot Air managing editor Ed Morrisey mocked Harris by way of White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre’s widely rebuked defense of Biden’s ""Where’s Jackie?"" gaffe. He wrote, ""I can't wait for @PressSec's explanations of how South Korea was ‘top of mind’ for Harris in this moment.""

Journalist Ian Miles Cheong remarked, ""Kamala Harris says the US is now in an alliance with North Korea. South Korea fall out of favor or something?""

PRESIDENT BIDEN SHOCKS TWITTER WITH CRINGEWORTHY GAFFE ABOUT DECEASED CONGRESSWOMAN

Toronto Sun political columnist Brian Lilley torched the Vice President, writing, ""If the Dems decide Biden isn’t their guy in 2024, they won’t be looking to Kamala Harris as the candidate. This is something straight out of an episode of Veep - praising the U.S. alliance with North Korea?""

Republican California state senator Melissa Menendez asked, ""Aside from the obvious blunder here, why can she go to the DMZ but not the border here in our own country?""

And Townhall.com web editor Rebecca Downs wrote, ""Kim Jong Un is laughing SO hard at us right now. Who thought it was a good idea to send her?

America has gone from government of laws to semi-political banana republic,"The rule of law has been replaced in Washington by ""yes we can."" The events we witnessed Thursday in the Senate, that is Majority Leader Harry Reid's success at invoking the so-called 'nuclear option,' stripping the minority party of its primary power to block nominations, have become a stunning capstone to what has been already a steady erosion of a government of laws down to a sort of semi-political banana republic.

We are now living in a republic in which politicians do what they want without regard to tradition or the best interests of our country.

The rule of more than 200 years since the Senate was formed, as described by James Madison, to be ""...the saucer of the hot cup of the House"" has been overthrown.

[pullquote]

The role of the Senate is to be a deliberative body. The rule of filibuster was overthrown Thursday by a change in the rules. It's a change which could never have even been conceived of before in our history, even in those periods when we've had total one party rule.

However, let me state for the record that when the Republicans tried the ""nuclear option"" I was as outraged then as I am now.

It was as wrong then as it was today in Washington.

It's depressing to see the people who put their party registration ahead of their responsibilities as American leaders.

Then, Democrats where screaming like stuck pigs. Yet many of those same representatives supported the nuclear option Thursday.

But this is not a short term, temporary political matter. This is not just about the upsetting of short term political rules. It's much bigger and should be upsettting to any America who puts their country ahead of their party.

For some time now we have been living in a period where a government operating on this slippery slope has been evident.

Consider in recent months, the reports, which are yet unproven but appear look serious about the possible tampering with official unemployment numbers.

In the past, even when the unemployment numbers have been gathered -- and not always without error -- the mere thought and the appearance that they were not published in good faith or tainted by politics never entered into the discussion.

The process of picking the numbers is sacrosanct. The possibility that politics influenced official employment figures strikes at the very core credibility of government. It means that government is now being turned into a mere servant of politics.

This is most troubling because for the first time we cannot dismiss the possibility of this out of hand. Such an issue, even the suspicion, goes to the very core of the credibility in the people's government.

The most recent and jarring example is the Affordable Care Act where the president has, despite the actual language of the law, assumed powers to exempt people, to change the meaning of the law. Of actual legislative statue.

In a way that is stunning. Indeed, the most egregious was the Democratic and Republican leaders coming together to agree to ignore the language in the Affordable Care Act legislation and grant themselves and their staffs a special subsidy. Sadly, this is something very few people have bothered to speak out against.

The slippery slide into semi-banana republicanism was not just a problem with President Obama.

You could see this disturbing trend emerge in the presidency of George W. Bush. And it has only accelerated from there.

For example, President Bush's claim, on signing statements, that he had the right to not enforce some of the things that were included in the law. That he believed he could designate parts of the law he had just signed as something he was not required to enforce.

Barack Obama campaigned against this in 2008 but since ascending to the presidency he has only expanded the process.

President Bush in his administration claimed ""presidential prerogatives"" that were never heretofore known in the areas of national security and in war powers.

It was a Republican administration and a Republican Congress that passed the Medicare Part D provision by illegally holding the vote in the House open for four and a half hours while the White House threatened and wheedled members of Congress into voting for it.

And of course it was a Republican-led Senate, supported by a Republican president that first threatened to invoke the nuclear option until responsible Republican senators were willing to act for constitutional government, and protectionary institutions and for the nation's greater good, over a short-term partisan agenda.

Thursday, only three Democrats were willing to put the institution before this effort

to achieve a short-term political goal.

That, my friends, this is the very definition of a slippery slope.

Surprisingly the outrage from the Republicans has been somewhat muted to say the least.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has complained that this event today was merely to distract attention from ObamaCare.

Really?

I have had conversations today with at least two conservatives who have said, ""so what? It will work for us next time, as soon as we take the Senate back."" And I doubt that those sentiments that were expressed are unique only to me.

What is missing, the dog that is not barking here, is that the Senate Republicans have not been willing to bring the body to a screaming halt to stop this institutional crime against a government of rules. And they could.

First of all, the Senate, by it's own rules, has a specific way of operating. There are many, many things, mundane things every day that occur only by ""unanimous consent."" The dissent of one senator can often delay the workings of the Senate.

Imagine what would happen if 45 or 48 Senators decide that they will agree to nothing in the face of this.

But they don't.

Imagine if every bill and every proposal in front of the Senate were filibustered on principle and that it required an effort to constitutionally over it?

Is not preserving representative government important enough?

Should not this effort, this coup d'état not be greeted with an attitude of ""wait till we get there"" but with a genuine outrage of men and women of principle?

We are in grave danger.

Tuesday we honored the 150th anniversary of government of the people, by the people and for the people when we remembered Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.

Now, just two days later, we are reminded just how grave the danger to that concept exists by members of a political class and their apologists in the maninstream media who will put political interests before the good of the United States of America.

What is astounding is the large degree and matter of fact complacency about this institutional act of coup de etat.

American self-government is under threat. And the American people no doubt know it. And something must happen.

This is why an undeclared war now exists between the mainstream of American and the established political class of both parties.

I feel, without question, that there will soon be open warfare between the great vast majority of the American people and this self-perpetuating and self-aggrandizing ruling class that is willing to put their ambitions and power above a government of the American people.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/america-has-gone-from-government-of-laws-to-semi-political-banana-republic,N/A

On the roster: A Republic, not a Democracy - Trump son huddled with pro-Kremlin group on Syria - Q poll shows good vibes for Trump from voters - Audible: Ommmmmmmmmmmmm… - Sweet ride

A REPUBLIC, NOT A DEMOCRACY

As Hillary Clinton’s lead in the popular vote stretches out to 1.5 points and may grow more with ballots still being counted in California, the sour grapes caucus in the Democratic Party is getting louder.

This is the fourth time in history that Democrats have won the popular vote but lost in the Electoral College. And this one is shaping up to be the widest discrepancy since 1876 when just one elector and the threat of renewed civil war stood between Republican Rutherford Hayes and Democrat Samuel Tilden.

Pressure is growing on members of the Electoral College to refuse to vote for the winners of their states. Given Donald Trump’s 74-vote lead in the Electoral College based on state returns, the effort seems to be a symbolic one at best.

More tantalizing for Democrats though, is the claim from “top computer scientists” that they see evidence of electronic ballot rigging in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. The fact that the experts made their case to the remnants of Clinton’s campaign that she dispute the official election results has allowed some embittered supporters of Clinton to remain in denial about the actual result.

But as data dervish Nate Silver explained Tuesday night on Twitter, the computer guys might have benefitted from some practical knowledge of politics. The claims don’t bear even modest scrutiny once you take into account the composition of the counties in question.

Part of the problem here, of course, is that many Democrats believed their nominee’s campaign rhetoric that Trump’s election would bring about the apocalypse. Here, some Democrats have fallen into the same trap that led Republicans, including the now president-elect, to search for conspiracy theories and loopholes to invalidate the Obama presidency all the way through his first term.

It’s sick stuff.

But leaving aside the sad consequences of eliminationist rhetoric on politics, there remains the question of how Americans pick their president and the utility of the Electoral College.

Some Californians are even discussing a “Caliexit” in which the largest state would secede from the Union. This is probably the same kind of blatherskite in which some Texas Republicans engaged during peak Obamism. Anger begets frustration which begets fanciful thinking as a means of mental escape.

But if California wanted to do something more practical, its residents might reconsider the failed plan to subdivide the golden state six ways. While some of the new post-California states might be Republican, the new Electoral College would include a dozen electors from states currently part of California.

What’s that you say? The Electoral College is undemocratic? Well, yeah. That’s the point.

Trump himself, as any good populist would, has heaped some scorn on the Framers’ model for picking the chief executive. Clinton is ahead by more than 2 million votes out of more than 133 million counted, so why should she lose?

The creation of the Electoral College was certainly part political pragmatism. The proponents of the proposed Constitution wanted a way to reassure skeptical states that their voices would be preserved in a system with a strong federal government. Having states, not the nation as a whole, choose the president was a reassurance.

But it was also philosophical, as the Federalists were eager to avoid rule of the mob and demagoguery. As resentful as they were of the aloof tyranny of George III and the British nobility, the American patriots were, if anything, more alarmed by the prospect of the tyranny of the masses.

Remember, Russia is a democracy. Iran is a democracy. America is a republic.

What set our experiment apart from all of human history before it, as well as almost all that has followed, is the primacy of the law. In a pure democracy, people could vote to enslave their neighbors, confiscate others’ property, deny rights to minority groups and outlaw unpopular positions. Those things are not possible here because our system values liberty over popularity.

Many in America today are worried that Trump is in fact the kind of demagogue the founders warned us of: using irresponsible, divisive talk, anger and blandishments to whip voters into a frenzy. His rallies, and rhetoric, no doubt struck fear into many hearts.

What is odd, then, is that some of those same people would be seeking the diminution of republican protections of the rights of minorities in our system.

Most alarming in that regard is the effort to “hack” the Constitution by getting all of the states to change their laws to bind their electors to the results of the national, not state, returns. This is a dodgy end-around and exactly the kind of thing that weakens our already battered institutions.

Yes, the Electoral College allowed Trump to win with a popular minority. But it also prevents the next president from winning by simply running up the score with voters in the most-populous areas.

Imagine what campaigns would look like if candidates were seeking popular rather than electoral majorities. If you think politics are crass and appeal to the lowest common denominator now, picture what would happen when one could win by ignoring much of the country and driving up the score in the most populated areas.

Welcome, President Camacho!

The Democrats who favor the idea of popular elections do so in the belief that they would be advantaged. They ought to not be so sure. In fact, both sides, and the larger goals of humanity and liberty, would be ill served by cutting out the role of states in the process.

Those who are the most alarmed about Trump ought to be working harder than anyone to reinforce, not undermine, the protections built into our system.

THE RULEBOOK: AND TURKEYS TOO

“The expediency of vesting the power of pardoning in the President has, if I mistake not, been only contested in relation to the crime of treason.”–Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 70

TIME OUT: FEZ OR FEATHERS?

Ever wonder why Turkey and turkeys have the same name? No, the country is not a breeding ground for the American Thanksgiving dinner. Dictionary.com: “The word turkey has been used to refer to ‘land occupied by the Turks’ since the 1300s … following World War I and the fall of the Ottomans, the republic of Turkey was declared, taking on the name that had long referred to that region…So how did the land occupied by the Turks become associated with a North American bird? First, we have to get to know another bird: the guinea fowl. This bird bears some resemblance to the American bird. Though it’s native to eastern Africa, the guinea fowl was imported to Europe through the Ottoman Empire and came to be called the turkey-cock or turkey-hen. When settlers in the New World began to send similar-looking fowl back to Europe, they were mistakenly called turkeys.”

TRUMP SON HUDDLED WITH PRO-KREMLIN GROUP ON SYRIA

WSJ: “Donald Trump’s eldest son, emerging as a potential envoy for the president-elect, held private discussions with diplomats, businessmen and politicians in Paris last month that focused in part on finding a way to cooperate with Russia to end the war in Syria, according to people who took part in the meetings. Thirty people, including Donald Trump Jr., attended the Oct. 11 event at the Ritz Paris, which was hosted by a French think tank. The founder of the think tank, FabienBaussart, and his wife, Randa Kassis, have worked closely with Russia to try to end the conflict… In an interview, Ms. Kassis said she pressed the younger Mr. Trump during the meeting on the importance of cooperating with the Russians in the Middle East…Kellyanne Conway, a senior adviser to the president-elect, confirmed the younger Mr. Trump’s attendance at the event in Paris. But she played down his direct contact with Ms. Kassis.”

Q POLL SHOWS GOOD VIBES FOR TRUMP FROM VOTERS

The latest poll from Quinnipiac University says that voters are generally optimistic about Donald Trump’s presidency, reaffirming a win bonus for the president-elect shown in other polls. While voters disagree or are narrowly divided on several of Trump’s policy positions, his first big-ticket item – a plan for massive borrowing and spending on infrastructure – is a smash hit with voters. Eighty-three percent of voters in the sample backed increasing federal spending with infrastructure.



SUBSTITUTIONS

--South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley has been named UN ambassador today, despite being an outspoken critic of Trump and campaigning for Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., in her state’s early primary. Haley released a statement saying that pending her Senate confirmation, she has accepted the position.

--Trump transition team has also announced that the president-elect has offered the nomination to be secretary of Housing and Urban Development to Ben Carson.

--Former Democratic Tennessee congressman and MSNBC persona Harold Ford Jr. is reportedly under consideration for a post in the Trump administration. Politico got a hold of Ford who demurred, but wasn’t saying no either.

--Newt Gingrich poured vinegar on the news that his 2012 Republican presidential rival Mitt Romney was a frontrunner for the secretary of state position telling “Tucker Carlson Tonight” that he could “think of 20 other people” better suited for job than Romney.

--Trump is reportedly looking at a long list of House members for cabinet posts. In addition to the much discussed potential appointment of Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, as treasury secretary, The Hill says others eyed for potential administration posts include: Reps. Cathy McMorris Rogers, R-Wash., Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., and Mike McCaul, R-Texas.

--Trump’s leading candidate to lead the Department of Defense, retired Gen. James Mattis, would require Congress to pass a law circumventing the requirement that military leaders be out of service for at least seven years before assuming the post. The WSJ explains the complexities.

--What were Trump-tormentor extraordinaire Mark Cuban and Trump senior adviser Steve Bannon talking about on Tuesday? Who knows? But Politico had the picture.



AUDIBLE: OMMMMMMMMMMMMM…

“I have no worries.” – Dalai Lama reacting to Donald Trump’s election at a press conference, reports AP

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Do you think that President elect Trump is saying he will not prosecute Mrs. Clinton until after he’s sworn in so that President Obama won’t pardon her while he’s still in office? Also, does Trump have any say over what the congressional committees that are investigating her will do? Thank you.” – Jean Patrick, Wayne, Pa.

[Ed. note: I prefer to not overthink such matters when it comes to politicians. I generally take their statements at face value, since they reverse themselves so often. My guess is that Trump would like a new start, and that he grows increasingly aware of the dangers of retributive justice between parties as he prepares to ascend to the presidency. Another factor to bear in mind is that Attorney General designee Jeff Sessions would not much care to have the affairs of his independent prospective office so minutely directed by the chief executive. The same goes for the members of Congress who very much would resent executive direction on the matter of their duties.]

“Halftime is a must with my morning coffee! It is ‘hightime’ I say thank you for the folksy, witty, way you deliver news. The real stuff is found between the lines, however, a tribute to your unique style. I think I’ll start using my Ole iron skillets again! Thank you, kind sir.”– Michele Chandler, Panorama Village, Texas

[Ed. note: Shucks, Ms. Chandler…you are too kind. Nothing cooks better than cast iron and nothing reads better than a note like yours.]

“I was lucky and privileged enough to meet you at the RNC convention in Cleveland, Ohio. As always, your political coverage is spot on and reading Halftime Report is always a blast-I noticed in a recent post that you said your mom made ham-bone bean soup. My family and I are big proponents of ham and cook it whenever we get the chance. Of course, we always make soup with the bone. If it isn’t too much trouble I would love your mom’s recipe-if you’re willing to share it of course. Nobody knows how to make ham-bone soup better than West Virginians and I would be honored to try my hand at it.” – Anthony C. Fix, Ashtabula, OH



[Ed note: Mr. Fix, if you are from Ashtabula, then I bet your bean soup isn’t too different than the one lovingly made by the late Joan Marie McCarthy Stirewalt, a daughter of Detroit. The quality of the ham matters much, as does the act of sending your husband to the garage with the bone to cut it with a hacksaw so that as it cooks, the marrow and flavor infuse the broth. Plenty of white onions, yes. Some celery, diced finely, certainly. Pale, white dried navy beans, sifted and soaked overnight, yep. The real issue with bean soup though is philosophical. Do you love it the way my grandfather Newman Claude Stirewalt did, thin, so that the beans rattle around in the bottom of the bowl? Or do you like it thick, like some others, so that the beans rupture and produce a porridge-y consistency? These are eternal questions that every man and woman must answer for themselves and then cook their pot for the appropriate length. But the soup is magical, to be sure. My father, a gourmand of the first waters, made up his mind to marry Ms. McCarthy the night she invited him over for a bowl of bean soup.]

SWEET RIDE

Belleville [Ill.] News-Democrat: “RED BUD -- When the repo man showed up, ‘Baby’ lost her ride. The little Pomeranian dog loved to curl up on 82-year-old Stanford Kipping’s lap when he and his wife Patty, 70, went for a drive. But in recent months a sharp increase in the cost of prescription medicine and other bills were more than a match for the couple’s fixed incomes…the repo man, Jim Ford of Belleville, stopped his tow truck in front of their house…Ford had met with the Kippings. In fact he tried to work out a deal with the bank for them to keep their car, but it was a no go…he decided that he would pay off the Kippings’ debt and return their car to their driveway…Ford said he raised more than $3,500 in one night. After the fee for the service and after paying the $2,501 to the bank owed on the Buick, Ford tucked $1,000 in cash into an envelope. A co-worker at his business bought a frozen Thanksgiving turkey…Baby was in Stanford Kipping’s arms, a leash around her neck, as both eyed the Buick.”

[Ed. note: You may remember newspapers. As my son explained to his little brother, “It’s like they printed out the Internet so you can read it.” I got my start writing nighttime sports for my hometown paper when I was 17. I was a goner from the first. Part of what I loved about newspapering was the continuity – the musty old files of clips that reached back generations, making a record of who we were and how we became what we are. “Older than the state itself,” read the banner at the top of Page One. My favorite Thanksgiving newspaper tradition has for decades been that paper’s annual republishing of the same perfect column about the holiday by the late Adam Kelly, known to his readers as “the country editor.” I was privileged to have his son, Bob, a great newsman himself, as my mentor when I later learned my way around politics in Charleston, W.Va. They talk about Washington being a swamp. But trust me, if you can wrestle the political gators on the Kanawha River, you can cover politics anywhere in the world. Bob, who was taken from us far too young, taught a generation of newspapermen and newspaperwomen how to take our jobs seriously without taking ourselves seriously – to be skeptics without becoming cynics. It’s no mean feat when the world entices you always to see the story in first person rather than keeping the proper sense of first doing your duty to your country and your readers. The key to that, I’ve learned through hard-bought wisdom, is to begin with gratitude. If I count the blessings in my life, I can start to see how much more I have than I deserve. Understanding that makes us kinder, more gracious and, most importantly, less selfish. Bob’s father’s column, offered here by another newspaper, is properly called a litany, which is a kind of prayer where congregants respond to the preacher in the pulpit. The word “litany” descends from Greek, where its root “litaneia” means “entreaty.” My entreaty to you is that you read Adam Kelly’s good, old words and meditate on your blessings. I know I don’t enjoy today every blessing its author did; nor do you, probably. But we can all claim many of them as Americans. And if we could really all count our blessings, one suspects that we would be a people more inclined to mercy, more given to self-sacrifice and more committed to building up than tearing down. Fox News Halftime Report is pausing for the holiday and will resume publication Monday. In the meantime, I wish you and your families bounty and blessings, but most of all, the gift of gratitude, especially in the face of adversity.]

"Chuck Schumer weighs in on Dominican Republic deaths, says ATF should also investigate","Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., says the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) should assist the FBI and local authorities to determine what caused the deaths of at least 10 Americans who vacationed to the Dominican Republic since June 2018.

Schumer noted that the agency has offices in the Caribbean and its technical and forensic expertise could aid the ongoing investigations.

""Given that we still have a whole lot of questions and very few answers into just what, if anything, is cause for the recent spate of sicknesses and several deaths of Americans in the Dominican Republic, the feds should double their efforts on helping get to the bottom of things,"" Schumer told The Associated Press.

ARGENTINIAN TEEN WAKES FROM COMA AFTER FALLING ILL IN DOMINICAN REPUBLIC

Local officials have said the American tourists have died of natural causes, but the victim's family members believe authorities should investigate to determine if the deaths were caused by alcohol or misused pesticides.

ATF spokeswoman April Langwell said the Treasury Department primarily handles investigations involving potentially tainted alcohol. But she said ATF has offered its assistance and would work with other law enforcement agencies to keep Americans safe.

The FBI has already analyzed alcohol samples from at least one minibar in the Dominican Republic resort, Bahia Principe La Romana, and the Ministry of Health communications director, Carlos Suero told CNN that a toxicology test was being run on the samples.

The Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Punta Cana decided to remove liquor dispensers from their minibars in guest rooms following the deaths in the hotel. Family members have said that at least three people died after drinking from their hotel minibars in various resorts.

The general manager of the resort, Erica Lopez told CNN the decision to remove the liquor dispensers was not made in reaction to the deaths but hopes it will “provide more tranquility for guests.”

Autopsies for nine of those who died at various Dominican Republic results were completed, however, authorities are awaiting further toxicology results with assistance from the FBI for three of those cases - including a couple who died together inside their hotel room.

COLORADO MAN VISITING DOMINICAN REPUBLIC DIES, RELATIVES SAY THEIR QUESTIONS TO AUTHORITIES GOING UNANSWERED

Francisco Javier Garcia, the tourism minister in the Dominican Republic, has said the deaths were a normal phenomenon and not mysterious.

“It’s not true these deaths were mysterious. Science also exists here in the Dominican Republic,” García told AP. “We have determined the cause of death of all the deaths that have happened here. There are no mysterious deaths here in the Dominican Republic.”

The U.S. State Department says over 2.7 million people visit the Dominican Republic every year and they feel there is no reason to be concerned.

""We have not seen an uptick in the number of U.S. citizen deaths reported to the department,"" an official at the State Department told NPR.

Son of woman who died in Dominican Republic slams nation's 'disgraceful' response,"The Dominican government's ""disgraceful"" response to a string of Americans falling fatally ill in the Caribbean nation shows something's not right with their account, according to the son of one woman who died.

Leyla Cox did not die of a heart attack - as Dominican officials told the family, son William Cox claimed Friday on ""The Story.""

""It's absolutely disgraceful. It's disgraceful to dismiss the families with everything that's going on over there,"" Cox said.

""There's something not right with this story. How many more Americans are going to have to die before something is done and we as Americans say enough is enough?""

FAMILY AND FRIENDS OF WOMAN WHO DIED IN THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC CLAIM AUTHORITIES ARE LYING ABOUT PAST 'SEVERAL HEART ATTACKS'

Host Ed Henry asked Cox if federal officials or lawmakers have reached out to him to help his family.

Cox said he wanted the White House to comment on the matter.

""I would personally like to hear what the Trump administration would have to say about this whole incident,"" he said.

""I have not been contacted by the FBI whatsoever. If you are watching, I need your help. Please reach out to me.""

However, he added that officials he's been able to speak with have been, ""very helpful.""

He speculated there could have been more sinister reasons for his mother's death.

""For all as I know, a crime could have been committed and the Dominican authorities are not even investigating that whatsoever,"" he said.

Dominican Republic resort deaths prompt congressman to announce trip to Caribbean nation,"Rep. Adriano Espaillat, D-N.Y., announced Thursday that he plans on travelling to the Dominican Republic to meet with officials in the Caribbean nation about the recent string of mysterious deaths of American citizens.

Espaillat, the first and only Dominican-American to serve in Congress, said he will head to the Dominican Republic sometime in the next two weeks.

“More than 3.2 million Americans visited the #DominicanRepublic last year,” Espaillat said in a tweet. “I am taking this trip to see for myself and ensure the safety of American tourists and visitors to the Dominican Republic remains priority.”

Along with Espaillat, Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., sent a letter on Wednesday to the State Department and the FBI asking for timely updates in the investigations into the nine Americans who have died in the Dominican Republic since last June. Pallone also asked the State Department to reconsider its travel advisory for the country in light of the deaths.

DOMINICAN REPUBLIC'S HEALTH MINISTRY CALLS MYSTERIOUS DEATHS 'FAKE NEWS' AS OFFICIAL LASHES OUT IN INTERVIEW

The nine Americans who have died over the last 12 months in the country all were staying at luxury, all-inclusive hotels and all died under somewhat similar circumstances, sometimes involving liquor from the mini-bar.

Neither the Dominican ministry of public health nor the ministry of tourism has publicly shared the final autopsy reports showing the reasons why the men and women succumbed.

The strange cases - along with the recent shooting there of ex-MLB star David Ortiz - have triggered a wave of speculation and questions from the victims’ families in the United States and prompted many to question whether the island is safe for visitors.

Government data shows that the Dominican Republic welcomed more than 6.5 million visitors from around the world in 2018. In the first two months of 2019, the country saw more than 600,000 tourists - an increase of eight percent compared to the same time last year. Of those 600,000, 65 percent came to the Dominican Republic from North America, mainly the U.S.

The Dominican government, as well as the U.S. Embassy in Santo Domingo, have emphasized over the last few weeks that the cases are isolated incidents and that the tourist destination is safe for travelers.

Gustavo Montalvo, the minister to the Dominican presidency, has reiterated the claim, saying no city in the island appeared in a recent report of the 50 most violent in the world by the Interamerican Development Bank.

“In that list of the 50 most dangerous cities in the world, there is none from the Dominican Republic,” he said during an event Wednesday hosted by the American Chamber of Commerce in the Dominican Republic. “Actually, we find ourselves very far from any similar figure.”

The ministries of public health and tourism are expected to release more information later this week, sources told Fox News.

Media Massacre: New Republic implodes as Rolling Stone reels,"While Rolling Stone was mortgaging its credibility with a botched rape story, the New Republic was mortgaging its future.

The two debacles, and other recent events, are a bad omen for a struggling news business.

Both organizations are doing damage control because both screwed up in a way that sullies their brand. But in a larger sense, such failures hurt all other journalists as well, by fueling public suspicion and disdain for what we do.

You may not care about the New Republic, but the 100-year magazine has a storied history that came to an abrupt halt when most of its top journalistic talent resigned in a revolt against the owner. Chris Hughes, who was Mark Zuckerberg’s Harvard roommate and a Facebook co-founder, thought he knew better than all those journalists who rely on such old-fashioned methods as reporting.

This would be inside baseball if Hughes had just ousted the editor, Frank Foer (who quit after learning his replacement had been hired—nice touch), and that triggered a bunch of resignations. But the larger reason they walked out was that Hughes cut the number of print issues each year from 20 to 10, talked about turning it into a tech company and asked for more “snackable content.”

What does Hughes have left without the staff? This is a proudly liberal magazine, but Charles Krauthammer once worked at the New Republic. So did Fred Barnes. Another conservative, Andrew Sullivan, served as editor, as did such liberals as Michael Kinsley, Chuck Lane and the New Yorker’s Hendrik Hertzberg.

The problem is that the New Republic is a policy-and-politics magazine, and such publications usually lose money. Hughes, understandably, wants to make money. And maybe he was depressed after his husband, Sean Eldridge, lost a House race in November.

Ross Douthat, the conservative New York Times columnist, writes: “The New Republic as-it-was, the magazine I and others grew up reading, was emphatically not just a ‘policy magazine.’ It was, instead, a publication that deliberately integrated its policy writing with often-extraordinary coverage of literature, philosophy, history, religion, music, fine art…

“The peril isn’t just that blithe dot-com philistines will tear down institutions that once sustained a liberal humanism. It’s that those institutions’ successors won’t even recognize what’s lost.”

Another TNR alumnus, the Washington Post's Dana Milbank, says Hughes broke his promises and is ""a dilettante and a fraud.""

Hughes may employ journalists, but he rarely grants them interviews (though he did speak to NPR). Instead, he defended himself in a Washington Post op-ed:

“I didn’t buy the New Republic to be the conservator of a small print magazine whose long-term influence and survival were at risk. I came to protect the future of the New Republic by creating a sustainable business so that our journalism, values and voice — the things that make us singular — could survive.”

At least his new CEO, Guy Vidra, has given interviews. He told the Poynter Institute: “I said some things that were, unfortunately, misinterpreted. I wish I could change that because there is nothing I want more than to continue the tradition of the things that make this place special and find a larger audience for it, increase its influence and take it into the next century.”

Good luck with that.

Hughes isn’t the only tech mogul to stumble as a media owner. While Amazon’s Jeff Bezos is pouring money into the Washington Post but not interfering with the newsroom, eBay founder Pierre Omidyar has run into big trouble with his venture First Look. He hired Matt Taibbi (formerly of Rolling Stone) to launch a satirical site, but their repeated clashes led Taibbi to quit, and the staffers he had hired were soon fired. Not an auspicious start for a rich guy who said he wanted to spend $250 million on first-class journalism.

In a report on Taibbi’s departure, Glenn Greenwald, the Snowden-leak guy hired as Omidyar’s top editor, wrote with three colleagues:

“Taibbi’s dispute with his bosses instead centered on differences in management style and the extent to which First Look would influence the organizational and corporate aspects of his role as editor-in-chief. Those conflicts were rooted in a larger and more fundamental culture clash that has plagued the project from the start: A collision between the First Look executives, who by and large come from a highly structured Silicon Valley corporate environment, and the fiercely independent journalists who view corporate cultures and management-speak with disdain.”

You can say that again.

Taibbi, meanwhile, has returned to Rolling Stone, and tweeted about the rape story: “Like everyone else at the magazine, I'm both mortified and sorry -- for the public, for anyone affected, and for the source herself.” And he fiercely defended the fact-checking department as “so intense that it’s nearly caused me nervous breakdowns in the past.”

But you can only do so much to fact-check a story that essentially relies on one woman’s account. Rolling Stone has been unable to explain why it failed to reach the men accused of assaulting Jackie; why it failed to talk to her friends, several of whom contradict major portions of her account; and why it didn’t heed the warning when Jackie herself asked to be removed from the article.

In short, Rolling Stone needs to explain how this badly flawed piece was published and who if anyone will be held accountable.

Every media organization makes mistakes. And every organization needs to turn a profit. But from the Rolling Stone travesty to the meltdowns at the New Republic and First Look, it’s getting harder to be optimistic about an already tarnished news business.

Pompeo says Capitol riot has not turned US into 'banana republic',"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is pushing back against criticism that the United States has turned into a 'banana republic' after Wednesday's riot at the Capitol.

""The slander reveals a faulty understanding of banana republics and of democracy in America,"" Pompeo tweeted in a thread Thursday evening. ""In a banana republic, mob violence determines the exercise of power. In the United States, law enforcement officials quash mob violence so that the people’s representatives can exercise power in accordance with the rule of law and constitutional government.""

Former President George Bush was quick to make the criticism on Wednesday after the events.

""This is how election results are disputed in a banana republic – not our democratic republic,"" he said in a statement.

Former Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., told Fox News' ""The Story"" that if anyone was ""thinking about moving to a narcos state or banana republic,"" Wednesday's attack was a good example of what it would look like.

""That is not America. That is not this idea of America,"" Gowdy added. ""We're a nation of laws, we're not a nation of people who attack law enforcement officers trying to accomplish a goal that was never going to be accomplished in the first place.""

MIKE POMPEO CALLS FOR HONG KONG PRO-DEMOCRACY ADVOCATES TO BE RELEASED

The riot by pro-Trump supporters took place as a joint session of Congress was certifying President-elect Joe Biden's Electoral College victory, causing lawmakers to go into lockdown. The riot left four dead, including one pro-Trump demonstrator who was shot and killed by Capitol Police, and resulted in at least 68 arrests, according to Washington police.

Pompeo immediately condemned the violence on Wednesday, calling it ""unacceptable.""

""I have traveled to many countries and always support the right of every human being to protest peacefully for their beliefs and their causes,"" Pomeo said. ""But violence, putting at risk the safety of others including those tasked with providing security for all of us, is intolerable both at home and abroad.""

He also called for the people involved in the riot to be prosecuted.

""Let us swiftly bring justice to the criminals who engaged in this rioting,"" he said.

TRUMP CONDEMNS CAPITOL RIOTERS, CALLS FOR CALM, VOWS TO ENSURE 'SEAMLESS TRANSITION OF POWER'

After the chaos, lawmakers continued the certification process of the Electoral College votes. Some Republicans who initially vowed to challenge states’ results due to voter fraud concerns announced they'd instead vote to certify.

Vice President Mike Pence, who had announced he would not overturn the will of voters, confirmed the Biden victory at 3:41 a.m. ET.

US closes embassy in Central African Republic,"The State Department has closed its embassy in the Central African Republic and ordered the ambassador and his diplomatic team to leave the country as rebels there continue to advance and violence escalates, U.S. officials said Thursday.

A Pentagon spokesman, Lt. Col. Todd Breasseale, said that at the State Department's request, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta had directed U.S. Africa Command to evacuate U.S. citizens and designated foreign nationals from the U.S. Embassy in Bangui ""to safe havens in the region.""

State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell said the U.S. Embassy had temporarily suspended operations, but not diplomatic relations with the country.

""This decision is solely due to concerns about the security of our personnel and has no relation to our continuing and long-standing diplomatic relations"" with the Central African Republic, Ventrell said in a statement.

Shortly after announcing the evacuation Thursday, the State Department warned U.S. citizens against travel to the Central African Republic, saying it could not ""provide protection or routine consular services to U.S. citizens"" and urging Americans who have decided to stay to ""review their personal security situation and seriously consider departing"" on commercial flights. Four days earlier, the State Department had issued a warning recommending against travel to the country and authorizing its non-emergency personnel in Bangui to leave.

U.S. officials said about 40 people were evacuated on an U.S. Air Force plane bound for Kenya. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss the details of the operation.

The departure of Ambassador Laurence Wohlers and his staff comes as the president of the Central African Republic on Thursday urgently called on France and other foreign powers to help his government fend off rebels who are quickly seizing territory and approaching this capital city, but French officials declined to offer any military assistance.

Rebels have seized at least 10 towns across the sparsely populated north, and residents in the capital of 600,000 people fear insurgents could attack at any time.

The developments suggest the Central African Republic could be on the brink of another violent change in government, something not new to the impoverished country. The current president, Francois Bozize, himself came to power nearly a decade ago in the wake of a rebellion.

Speaking to crowds in Bangui, Bozize pleaded with foreign powers to do what they could. He pointed in particular to France, Central African Republic's former colonial ruler.

About 200 French soldiers are already in the country, providing technical support and helping to train the local army, according to the French defense ministry.

French President Francois Hollande said Thursday that France wants to protect its interests in Central African Republic and not Bozize's government. Paris is encouraging peace talks between the government and the rebels.

President Barack Obama late last year sent about 100 U.S. special operations forces to the region -- including Central African Republic -- to assist in the hunt for Joseph Kony, the fugitive rebel leader of the notorious Lord's Resistance Army. Forces have been hunting the elusive warlord in Central African Republic, South Sudan and Congo.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/us-closes-embassy-in-central-african-republic,N/A
"'A Republic, If You Can Keep It' by Neil Gorsuch","From the publisher: As Benjamin Franklin left the Constitutional Convention, he was reportedly asked what kind of government the founders would propose. He replied, “A republic, if you can keep it.” In this book, Justice Neil Gorsuch shares personal reflections, speeches, and essays that focus on the remarkable gift the framers left us in the Constitution.

Justice Gorsuch draws on his thirty-year career as a lawyer, teacher, judge, and justice to explore essential aspects our Constitution, its separation of powers, and the liberties it is designed to protect. He discusses the role of the judge in our constitutional order, and why he believes that originalism and textualism are the surest guides to interpreting our nation’s founding documents and protecting our freedoms. He explains, too, the importance of affordable access to the courts in realizing the promise of equal justice under law—while highlighting some of the challenges we face on this front today.

Along the way, Justice Gorsuch reveals some of the events that have shaped his life and outlook, from his upbringing in Colorado to his Supreme Court confirmation process. And he emphasizes the pivotal roles of civic education, civil discourse, and mutual respect in maintaining a healthy republic.

A Republic, If You Can Keep It offers compelling insights into Justice Gorsuch’s faith in America and its founding documents, his thoughts on our Constitution’s design and the judge’s place within it, and his beliefs about the responsibility each of us shares to sustain our distinctive republic of, by, and for “We the People.”",https://www.foxnews.com/shows/fox-and-friends/a-republic-if-you-can-keep-it-by-neil-gorsuch,N/A
Retired MLB star David Ortiz recounts being shot in Dominican Republic: 'I want to find out who did this',"Former Boston Red Sox slugger David Ortiz gave his first English-language interview since a near-fatal shooting at a bar in his native Dominican Republic in June.

Ortiz, 43, sat down with the Boston Globe in Fenway Park last week, explaining he’s determined to find out who is responsible for the shooting that caused him to undergo several surgeries and left him bound to a hospital bed for nearly seven weeks.

The 20-year MLB star known as “Big Papi” made his first public appearance since the shooting last Monday when he threw out the opening pitch at Fenway.

DAVID ORTIZ THROWS OUT FIRST PITCH AT FENWAY PARK MONTHS AFTER SHOOTING

“I want to find out who did this,’’ Ortiz told the Boston Globe. “I’m not going to sit around and chill if there’s somebody out there who wants to kill me.’’

“I’m not going to sit around and chill if there’s somebody out there who wants to kill me.’’ — David Ortiz

“I don’t know why I was involved in something like this because I’m not the type of person who looks for trouble or causes trouble,” he told the newspaper. “All I worry about is trying to help people, about trying to do the right thing.”

Eleven people, all of whom Ortiz said he didn’t recognize, have been arrested in connection with the June 9 shooting at the Dial Bar in Santo Domingo, where the former pro-baseball player was shot at close range while his back was turned away from an identified gunman who fled the scene.

Ortiz said he hired former Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis to investigate the case after Dominican officials released conflicting motives to explain why he was shot. Officials in the Carribean island nation now blame the shooting on a case of mistaken identity. Ortiz also told the Globe how he experienced moments in the hospital “feeling like I was going to die.""

""I had nightmares all the time about being in the desert, looking for water,"" Ortiz told the paper. ""I would wake up with my mouth dry and feeling like I'm going to die.""

""I would wake up with my mouth dry and feeling like I'm going to die."" — David Ortiz

“I felt that if I didn’t die, then I would never be the same again,’’ he continued. “I went through hell with that.” Ortiz also tipped his hat to medical staff at Massachusetts General Hospital for reassuring him that he would survive.

The Red Sox had Ortiz airlifted from the Dominican Republic to Massachusetts General Hospital where he underwent several surgeries to address his wounded intestines and liver. He also underwent surgery in the Dominican Republic the day before he was transported to Boston.

He said he contracted a dangerous acute bacterial infection during his hospital stay in Boston and had to substitute food for Jello and ice chips, causing him to lose about 40 pounds. He was released on July 27 — nearly seven weeks after he was shot.

Dominican police now believe a suspected drug trafficker and fugitive named Victor Hugo Gomez Vasquez offered to pay $30,000 for the murder of his cousin David Fernández after he was feeding information to authorities. Fernández was sitting next to Ortiz at the nightclub at the time of the shooting. Authorities initially said a $7,800 bounty had been placed on Ortiz for unknown reasons, according to the New York Post.

Ortiz is to return to his job as a Fox Sports analyst for the upcoming MLB postseason. He started his career with the Minnesota Twins then spent 14 years with the Red Sox and is one of the most popular players in the team's history. He was a key player on three World Series-winning teams in 2004, 2007 and 2013.

"Cruz, Polanco homer to lift Dominican Republic to 3-0 win","SAN DIEGO (AP) Nelson Cruz hit his third home run of the tournament and Gregory Polanco also went deep, leading defending World Baseball Classic champion the Dominican Republic to a 3-0 victory Thursday night that pushed Venezuela to the brink of elimination.

The Dominican Republic (1-1) had won 11 straight WBC games until losing to Puerto Rico in the Pool F opener on Tuesday night.

Venezuela (0-2) fell victim to a United States comeback on Wednesday night.

The Americans play Puerto Rico on Friday night. On Saturday, Puerto Rico faces Venezuela and the Dominican Republic faces the United States. The top two teams advance to the semifinals at Dodger Stadium. The Pool F winner plays the Netherlands on Monday while the Pool F runner-up plays Japan on Tuesday. The championship game is Wednesday night.

Cruz homered to right off Arcenio Leon leading off the eighth. He hit a three-run homer off Andrew Miller in the eighth inning Saturday night to help the Dominicans rally for a 7-5 victory against the United States in the opening round in Miami.

Robinson Cano hit an RBI single in the seventh.

Jhoulys Chacin (0-1), who signed with the Padres in December, locked into a duel with former Padres pitcher Edinson Volquez.

Chacin put runners on first and second with two outs in the third before punching out Jose Bautista. Chacin slapped his glove in celebration as he headed to the dugout.

But he still got the loss in his new home ballpark after he allowed Polanco's homer to right leading off the fifth to break the scoreless tie.

Chacin reached his pitch count two batters later after walking Jose Reyes, leaving after allowing one run and three hits, striking out three and walking three.

Dominican manager Tony Pena pulled Volquez after the Miami Marlins right-hander put runners on first and third with one out in the fifth. Fernando Abad (1-0) came on and got Ender Inciarte to ground into a double play.

Volquez allowed four hits, struck out six and walked two. Jeurys Familia pitched the ninth for the save, allowing two bloop singles that put runners on the corners before striking out Alcides Escobar to end it.

Dominican third baseman Manny Machado made a great play to throw out Miguel Cabrera in the sixth. Machado backhanded the ball, spun and threw from deep in foul territory.

Cubs pitcher Pedro Strop uninjured after car crash in Dominican Republic,"Chicago Cubs pitcher Pedro Strop was involved in a car crash in his native Dominican Republic but was not injured, officials said Friday.

The 29-year-old was driving an SUV when he crashed through a wall late Wednesday along a road southwest of the capital of Santo Domingo.

""We've talked with Pedro's family, and they've told us he's doing well and resting at home,"" Juan Mercado, general assistant manager of the Cibao Giants winter league team, told The Associated Press.

The cause of the crash is not clear. Strop was traveling with a friend identified as Yeudy Delgado, who also was not injured, officials said.

Video captured shortly after the crash shows the hood of a white Range Rover completely crumpled after the SUV apparently broke through a cinderblock wall along with another car.

It was the third crash within a month involving a Dominican baseball player.

Ronald Guzmán, a prospect with the Texas Rangers, was involved in a fatal accident on Tuesday in which a 27-year-old man died. On Oct. 26, St. Louis Cardinals rookie outfielder Oscar Taveras and his girlfriend died in a crash. Police said he was driving with a blood alcohol level more than five times the legal limit.

Several other players have died in the past two decades in car crashes in the Dominican Republic, which has the second-highest traffic-related death rate in the world, with nearly 42 deaths per 100,000 people.

“A life experience take place on us dropping off one of my kids at college..... good luck with everything and remember 'to be great you have to bring the best out of you everyday' lov you....mom & dad!!!”

The photos come amid the ex-slugger's reported hiring of former Boston police commissioner Ed Davis to lead an independent investigation into the Dominican Republic shooting.

“He’s damn interested in finding out what really happened,” Joe Baerlein, a spokesman for Ortiz, told the Boston Globe, adding that Ortiz hasn’t spoken to Dominican Republic authorities about the shooting since after surgery in Santo Domingo.

Baerlein said U.S. officials haven’t spoken to Ortiz either.

“David has been carefully monitoring the government and police investigation,” Baerlein told the Boston Globe. “He had no basis for a long time to challenge their theory of mistaken identity. However, as new facts continue to come up, it lends some optimism that there may be some other conclusions that are drawn before it’s over about why David was shot.”

Dominican National Police Colonel Frank Felix Duran Mejia told the Boston Globe that investigators looked into other possible motives behind the shooting but they were unsubstantiated. He added that Ortiz was “in the wrong place at the wrong time.”

Dominican Republic officials believe they have identified man who paid David Ortiz hitmen,"Dominican Republic authorities have identified the mastermind they believe paid hitmen to try and kill David Ortiz, who is still at large.

As the police close in on a motive for the shooting, officials identified the man as Alberto Miguel Rodriguez Mota and alleged he planned to provide the nearly $8,000 bounty to have the retired Boston Red Sox slugger killed. Mota was charged with attempted murder, according to the Boston Globe.

DAVID ORTIZ'S DOCTORS DESCRIBE LIFE-SAVING SURGERY: 'THE INJURIES HE HAD WERE LETHAL'

The identification of Mota came as authorities held a hearing for another suspect nicknamed “Bone.” The man, whose real name is Gabriel Alexander Perez Vizcaino, is accused of being the liaison between the alleged hitmen and the person who paid them, the Associated Press reported, citing court documents.

According to the documents, a man who is already in prison for an unrelated crime reached out to Perez for the alleged job a week before the June 9 shooting at a Santo Domingo bar. The person reportedly sent him a picture of the target so he could share it with the hit men.

The picture was shared with the other suspects as they met at a gas station minutes before the shooting. Police haven’t said whether the picture was of Ortiz. Rolfi Ferreira Cruz, the alleged gunman, had previously shouted in court that the hit wasn’t on Ortiz and that the slugger’s clothing confused him.

Perez sold a gold iPhone 6 used to plan the attack to a woman for $180 so he can rid of the evidence a day after the shooting, according to court documents. Authorities said the phone was giving him problems and that’s why he was forced to sell it.

Perez’s attorney didn’t comment on the allegations.

Police have now detained 10 suspects in connection with the shooting, which has left Ortiz bed-ridden at a Massachusetts hospital. Police said they were searching for at least two other men, including the man accused of paying the alleged hit men.

"Dominican Republic’s ‘Desperate’ Baseball Culture Fuels Steroid Use, Experts Say","For boys in the Dominican Republic, it’s about becoming a major league ballplayer – at all costs.

In a country where 40 percent of the nation lives at or below the poverty rate, Dominicans who are 12 to 14 years old regularly quit school to begin baseball training in private academies in the hopes of saving their families from a lifetime of poverty. For these boys, it’s baseball or failure.

For Major League Baseball, like in any business, it’s about the bottom line, mainly, how to find the next franchise player at the lowest cost possible.

But the combination of both priorities mix together like a toxic concoction, in the form of steroid-filled syringes, made easily available to thousands of teenage Dominicans dreaming of lifting their families out of poverty with a swing of the bat.

The recent suspension of 13 players, 9 of whom are Dominican, by Major League Baseball in the Biogenesis scandal highlights how the growing problem in the country has affected the sport – and many are questioning whether baseball is doing enough to fight the steroid culture in the Dominican Republic, a country the majors has grown more and more reliant on for top talent.

""If they see that baseball is not the only way out - you’ll see a dramatic drop in use of steroids because the win at all cost mentality will disappear."" — Charles S. Farrell, Co-founder of the Dominican Republic Sports and Education Academy

As it has each year since MLB began releasing data in 1995, the D.R. led all foreign countries with the most players in the majors in 2013 with 89 players on opening day rosters (out of 856) – the fourth most the nation has ever produced. But, at the same time, the country has a disproportionate number of players who have violated the leagues performance-enhancing drug policy.

According to the MLB, thus far in 2013, 15 of the 44 players suspended for steroids in the minor leagues are Dominican and, in 2012, 31 minor league Dominicans were suspended out of 105 total suspensions.

The problem, say experts like David Fidler, co-author of “Stealing Lives: The Globalization of Baseball and the Tragic Story of Alexis Quiroz,” is Major League Baseball’s knack for being reactionary, suspending players, instead of proactive in choosing not to attack the root of the PED problem, like the drug dealers themselves.

The players implicated in the Biogenesis scandal, including Alex Rodriguez, Nelson Cruz, and Jhonny Peralta, were only caught because MLB cut deals with the drug dealers themselves, who in this case, exchanged valuable information on their customers for immunity.

In the Dominican Republic, many of these dealers, who Fidler calls part of the root of the problem, are referred to as buscones – individuals who train players and then get a cut of their signing bonus, reportedly 10 to 40 percent, when they sign on to an MLB team.

“We’ve been making these arguments for years – we need to go after this buscones system hard,” Fidler, a lawyer, told Fox News Latino. “We can’t regulate in the Dominican Republic. But Major League Baseball has the power to tell the teams what to do. They haven’t done it. They’ve dragged their feet.”

Now, he said, “there is a cancer growing in Major League Baseball.”

Fidler said the MLB has created a business model, primarily in the Dominican Republic, with built in economic incentives for all parties involved, with teenagers and children as the most valued commodity.

The buscones invest in young 13 to15 year old prospects before they reach age 16 and helps them become eligible for one of 30 official MLB academies where teams house young Dominican players in the hopes that a handful become major league players.

Buscones make money – and the MLB pumps millions into the local economy. In return, the MLB receives top free agent talent from a country that regularly produces some of world's best baseball players.

While experts say Major League Baseball could do more to cut down on the steroid problem in the Dominican Republic, the league claims it is trying.

MLB has increased the number of drug tests in the D.R. by 50 percent between 2004 and 2013. During that time, the positive test rate has decreased from 11 percent in 2004 to 1.4 percent in 2012. They have also implemented mandatory performance-enhancing drug programs educating players on MLB’s official drug policies and the negative, long-term health effects of steroid use.

The Alderson Report

But Fidler, and others, point out that MLB did not begin addressing the seriousness of the problem in the Dominican Republic until the issue was publicly exposed in 2009, in large part because of the release of the documentary “Ballplayer: Pelotero.” The documentary followed two young 16-year-old Dominican prospects and showed how MLB – and the buscones – operate there.

At that time, MLB Commissioner Bud Selig appointed a committee, headed by current New York Mets General Manager Sandy Alderson, ""to examine Major League Baseball and Club operations in the Dominican Republic."" The results of the committee were published in September 2009, in the ""Alderson Report"" – the first comprehensive investigation by MLB into the Dominican Republic’s baseball steroid use. The report acknowledged that MLB had serious and long-term problems in the D.R., and recommended actions for reform.

The report also acknowledged that teams were hesitant in acknowledging buscones out of concern that clubs would be denied access to top talent.

MLB created an international talent committee to better regulate issues in the Dominican Republic and talked about implementing an international draft, which would effectively end the wild west buscones culture in the country. But talks of an international draft have ended for now, and, according to Fidler, the MLB has been silent about what the committee has actually done.

""Root and branch reform in the Alderson Report gave a glimpse that they needed to fix the system,"" Fidler said. ""We fear that’s gone and the talent committee isn’t serious about the rest of the issues.""

Desperate Mentality In Pursuit Of Baseball Dreams

Erick Almonte, a Dominican ballplayer player who faced suspension after testing positive while he played for the Milwaukee Brewers's Triple-A affiliate, said steroid use in the Dominican Republic is a problem the MLB needs to properly address – and now.

""Everyone knows the problem that exists in the Dominican Republic,” said Almonte, who was eventually cleared after his samples underwent further testing. “It's not the same there as it is here. You can get these substances without a prescription.”

He said Dominican players get desperate trying to make it big – and it’s so easy in the country to cut corners.

In Dominican pharmacies, testosterone is legal and easily sold over the counter. Though other types of performance-enhancing drugs are illegal in the country, they are often readily available and sold in neighborhood pharmacies.

“I know there aren't that many opportunities in our country and although we know they're prohibited, we keep trying to cheat the system,” Almonte said. “I hope that our mentality changes, too.""

Charles Farrell, co-founder of the Dominican Republic Sports and Education Academy in San Pedro de Marcoris, said he is trying to change this Dominican mentality of desperation. He has devoted his life to helping the 98 percent of Dominican ballplayers, mostly children, who sacrifice their education to try and make it to the major leagues – but don’t.

Farrell said many of those players consider themselves failures if they don’t become professional baseball players.

They think, “If I take steroids I win, and the team wins, what’s the harm if I cheat and everyone wins? They don’t realize they harm themselves,” he said.

Farrell said the recent suspensions of MLB All-Stars Rodriguez and Cruz could deter kids from taking steroids. Ultimately, though, he believes there needs to be a dramatic shift in the way Dominicans think of baseball, away from the only-way-out mentality.

But, Farrell said, that will only happen if there is a long-term solution that attacks the root of the problem. The solution, he said, is education.

""Even when I talk to kids – 98 percent will not make it to the majors – but it’s almost like every kid is sitting there saying, well ‘I’m part of the 2 percent,’"" Farrell said. ""If they see that baseball is not the only way out, you’ll see a dramatic drop in use of steroids because the win-at-all-cost mentality will disappear.""

Red Sox hero David Ortiz out of intensive care after being shot in Dominican Republic,"Red Sox fans have plenty to cheer about Saturday night.

Beantown hero David Ortiz has been moved out of the intensive care unit, two weeks after he was shot in a botched hit job in his native Dominican Republic.

SHOOTING OF DAVID ORTIZ IS RESULT OF MISTAKEN IDENTITY, DOMINICAN REPUBLIC LEAD PROSECUTOR SAYS

“David was moved out of the intensive care unit at Massachusetts General Hospital. He remains in good condition and continues to recover under the care of Drs. David King and Larry Ronan,” his wife, Tiffany Ortiz, said via a statement issued by the Red Sox.

Ortiz was shot in the back while out at a bar in his hometown of Santo Domingo on June 9. Eleven people have been arrested in connection with the shooting.

"Shooting of David Ortiz result of mistaken identity, Dominican Republic lead prosecutor says","Former Red Sox slugger David Ortiz was not the target of a shooting in a nightclub in his hometown on June 9, according to the Dominican Republic’s lead prosecutor.

Attorney General Jean Alain Rodríguez said the shooting was result of mistaken identity, and the target was another man, dressed similarly to Ortiz, who was seated with the ex-baseball star on the night of the shooting at a bar in Santo Domingo.

Rodríguez said the shooting was orchestrated by a member of Mexico’s Gulf Cartel, who remains on the run.

ACCUSED DAVID ORTIZ GUNMAN CLAIMS SLUGGER WASN’T INTENDED TARGET

He did not immediately describe a motive.

At the time of the attack, Ortiz was with TV personality Jhoel López and the apparent target, a man named David Fernandez, at Dial Bar and Lounge, which once served as a casual hangout for people getting their cars cleaned across the street. Ortiz was sitting with his back to the street when he was shot once in the back by a bullet that also injured López.

The shooting was carried out by two men on a motorcycle who were followed by several suspects in two cars, authorities said.

Eleven suspects have been arrested, including the alleged shooter identified as Rolfy Ferreyra, aka Sandy, a skinny, tattooed 25-year-old whom U.S. prosecutors said is wanted on armed robbery and gun charges in New Jersey.

The other suspects include Joel Rodríguez de la Cruz, aka Squiddy; Reynaldo Rodríguez Valenzuela, aka The Chinaman; Franklin Junior Merán, aka Rubirosa; Porfirio Ayendy Dechamps Vásquez, aka Kid; and Eddy Vladimir Feliz García, aka The Package, who was identified as the alleged motorcycle driver.

Authorities said García was captured and beaten by angry fans after he skidded and fell off his bike as the pair tried to flee. García’s attorney has said his client is an Ortiz fan and had no idea his passenger was going to commit a crime.

The weapon used in the shooting, a Browning Hi Power semi-automatic pistol, was buried in the garden of one of the suspect’s home and was later turned over to police by his mother, according to court documents obtained by The Associated Press.

Rodríguez said the shooting was orchestrated by a man named Victor Hugo Gomez, whom he described as a member or associate of the Gulf Cartel, one of Mexico’s major drug-trafficking organizations.

Officials did not say why Gomez would have targeted Fernandez.

James Wagner, a reporter for The New York Times, tweeted: “Authorities said the alleged target was wanted by Victor Hugo Gomez because he thought he'd talked and gotten him imprisoned.”

Gomez was believed to be in the United States and was being sought by the Drug Enforcement Administration, said Maj. Gen. Ney Aldrin Bautista Almonte, director of the Dominican Republic’s national police.

DAVID ORTIZ'S DOCTORS DESCRIBE LIFE-SAVING SURGERY: 'THE INJURIES HE HAD WERE LETHAL'

Ortiz remains hospitalized from the gunshot wound to his back.

Doctors have upgraded his condition from “guarded” to “good.”

Ortiz, a three-time World Series champion, had to have his gallbladder and part of his intestine removed.

Doctors who cared for him at a Dominican Republic hospital told The Washington Post that his injuries were “lethal.”

“The injuries he had were lethal, even separately, if they wouldn’t have been taken care of right away, especially the one on the liver,” Jose Smester told the newspaper. “But in that moment, you don’t think about death, you think about what you have to do.”

The <i>Other</i> Football: Should Sacramento Republic try to join Liga MX?,"When a U.S. club soccer team gets knocked back from joining Major League Soccer, its path to joining a top tier soccer league is severely limited, at least that seemed to be the thinking when Sacramento Republic F.C. of the United Soccer League was passed over by MLS as a possible expansion team earlier this year.

That is, until a sports columnist floated a rather outside-the-box – in fact, outside-the-country – idea: Why not apply to join Mexico’s Liga MX?

The Sacramento Bee Columnist Andy Furillo in May asked readers to look south of the border to Mexico’s top league.

A club team playing outside of its country is not altogether new; three Canadian teams play in the MLS, two in the NASL and Swansea City of Wales plays in the English Premiership to name just a few.

A move to the Mexican league on the surface would seem like a great idea for U.S. teams who are within a reasonable flying distance to Mexico and have thus far not had success with the MLS bidding process.

Steve Graff, who writes and covers Mexican soccer for FútMexSource, thinks one of the reasons such a question has been floated is because of the lack of a promotion-and-relegation system in the U.S.

“It would be a major story and a fantastic thing for U.S. soccer,” Graff said about Sacramento jumping to the Liga MX. “Many here want to see U.S. clubs compete in an environment where clubs are promoted and relegated between the various divisions in Mexico's soccer pyramid.”

By “pyramid,” Graff is referring to the how soccer is organized from the top professional leagues all the way down to the amateur level. In Mexican soccer, as in Europe and the rest of Latin America, teams rise and fall between top league and the lower ones according to their performance.

“It [would] be historic in many ways,” Graff said. “If Sacramento Republic is able to play its way up to Liga MX and win there, it will likely have a better shot at glory in both North America (with the CONCACAF Champions League) and South America (Copa Libertadores) than any other team in the United States.

However, Graff noted that such a move might prove problematic.

“There will be a lot of legal questions that have to be sorted out,” he told Fox News Latino. “But the fact this is a thought speaks to how poor [the U.S. and Mexican] confederations are managing their pyramids.”

Jason Marquitz, a freelance writer specializing in Mexican soccer, questions the feasibility of such a move given the ongoing and profitable ties between the MLS and the Mexican soccer federation and wonders whether the owners of Liga MX teams would go for such an arrangement.

“Ultimately, there are too many difficulties to foresee something like this happening. Liga MX is not in need of a U.S.-based franchise because it already has a substantial following in the States.”

Yet Marquitz, who also edits the blog SoccerMexicana.com, believes the rewards, if it ever were to happen would be significant.

“A U.S. team would gain access to a major television revenue stream,” he told FNL. “Liga MX television ratings both in Mexico and the U.S. are substantial, and the money that follows those ratings is enough to transform a club outside of the constraints of the MLS single-entity system. This revenue could be spent to bolster the club's roster with freedom of choice.”

Mariano Trujillo, a former player for El Tri who played both in Liga MX and MLS, is now an analyst with Fox Deportes and host of host of ""Fox Deportes en Vivo.""

Unlike MLS teams, Trujillo noted, “in Liga MX you have your own budget, you can spend as much money as you want, or you can, and there’s relegation so there’s some rules that are quite different comparing it to the MLS, so I think it will be a little bit tricky for them business wise,” he said.

Trujillo expressed interest in the proposal.

“Now that you mention it, I’m getting excited, because that would be good,” he said. “[Sacramento] is probably three and a half hours in an airplane, so that’s not too far.”

As for the Liga MX owners, Trujillo left some room for hope: “I don’t see an issue with the team owners or the big teams in Mexico.”

As Sacramento Republic FC gets ready for a friendly this week against Atlas F.C. of the Liga MX, one can only wonder if sometime soon this fixture will turn into something more permanent.

"To the quarters: USA routs Czech Republic, 119-84 in Tokyo","The U.S. lost its first two exhibition games of the summer in Las Vegas, dropped its opening game at these Olympics and had a difficult time shaking free of the Czech Republic in their group-play finale.

None of that matters now.

The Americans are headed to the quarterfinals at the Tokyo Games — with a shot of being good as gold once again. Jayson Tatum scored 27 points, Kevin Durant added 23 and set a pair of USA Basketball men's Olympic records, and the U.S. defeated the Czechs 119-84 on Saturday to clinch a berth in the knockout stage.

""I think our guys really focused well and did a good job in gaining ground, day by day, practice by practice,"" U.S. coach Gregg Popovich said. ""Hopefully we'll continue that moving forward. We have to if we want to be successful.""

Zach LaVine scored 13 points, Jrue Holiday had 11 and JaVale McGee finished with 10 points for the U.S. The Americans shot 7 for 20 in the first quarter — then made 33 of 44 shots over the next 26 minutes, including a staggering 21-for-25 start to the second half.

""It's fun to watch,"" Holiday said, ""and fun to be part of.""

The U.S. (2-1) finished second behind France in Group A, but will join the French, Australia and the winner of Sunday’s game between Slovenia and Spain as a top-four seed for Tuesday’s quarterfinals based on FIBA's tiebreaker system that includes point differential.

Those quarterfinal matchups will be decided in a draw on Sunday night, but the U.S. has now assured itself of not having to face any of the three group winners until at least the semifinals.

Blake Schilb scored 17 for the Czech Republic (1-2), which led by 10 early and was still within 60-54 midway through the third quarter.

In a flash, the Czech hope of a stunner ended there.

""I think the first half, we played amazing. ... Second half, we ran out of gas,"" Czech Republic coach Ronen Ginzburg said.

Durant — who passed Carmelo Anthony as both the U.S. Olympic men’s all-time points and all-time field goals leader during the game — hit a 3-pointer to end the third quarter, capping a 22-6 run that put the Americans up by 22 going into the final quarter.

The outcome was not in doubt again, and Durant said the scoring record was ""special"" to him on a night where the Americans engineered a 48-point turnaround from being down 10 to leading by as many as 38.

""You just think about all the players that played in this program,"" Durant said. ""Pretty cool to be amongst names like that. Carmelo is a guy that I played on two Olympic teams with, I've seen his approach to these games and I've tried to steal some of his techniques.""

Ondrej Balvin scored 15, Jan Vesely had 13 and Tomas Satoransky added 12 points for the Czechs, who were eliminated. The U.S., France, Australia, Spain, Slovenia, Germany, Italy and the winner of Sunday's game between Argentina and host Japan will be playing on Tuesday, their medal hopes still intact.

Once in the quarters, it is win-or-else time. And the quarterfinals were the round where it all went awry for the U.S. at the last major international competition, the Basketball World Cup in China two years ago. The Americans lost to France, ending all hope of a medal and eventually finished seventh.

Here, it's all about the medal — that is, one medal, and one medal only.

""We don't plan on getting bronze or silver,"" U.S. reserve Keldon Johnson said.

This U.S. team — which lost to France to open the Olympics before posting a 54-point win over Iran and a 35-point win on Saturday — hasn’t looked much like that World Cup team did two years ago, though it needed some time to find its best stride against the Czechs.

The Czechs led by as many as 10 in the first quarter, shooting 65% to the Americans’ 35% in the opening 10 minutes. With a roster featuring just one current NBA player — Satoransky — they did not look the least bit intimidated by the U.S.

""Congratulations to the USA,"" said Satoransky, who revealed he's been playing in the Olympics with a groin injury that he said will need time to heal. ""Unfortunately, we couldn't continue with the same type of basketball after the first half. ... Obviously, they're the best team in the world.""

Durant gave the U.S. its first lead midway through the second quarter, a 3-pointer putting the Americans up 34-33. The lead eventually got to as much as seven, before the U.S. settled for a 47-43 edge at halftime.

And that left some in the crowd — hundreds of people were in the lower bowl of the arena, even though no tickets were being sold — more than a bit anxious. Among them: Members of the German team; their hopes of qualifying as one of the top third-place teams hinged on the outcome of this game.

By the start of the fourth, the Germans could relax. So could the Americans, who are ""extremely"" confident heading into the quarterfinals, McGee said. After some time together, some adversity together, the world's No. 1-ranked team looks like the one to catch yet again.

Japanese Families Return to Dominican Republic,"Between Teruki Waki's porch and the Constanza mountains lies the blooming farmland that hundreds of his fellow immigrants thought would never grow.

It is the unlikely triumph over a mistake made 50 years ago — a story of failure and heartbreak only now coming to closure.

Thousands of poor Japanese families came to the Dominican Republic in the postwar 1950s, encouraged by the Tokyo government to take the offer of free land and a new life. But the soil was bad and the Caribbean nation would soon be plunged into political chaos. In less than a decade nearly all the Japanese were gone.

Their story is a striking example of the convulsion that gripped post-World War II Japan. The ripples were still being felt last week, when the emigrants finally won an apology from their prime minister.

Dominican dictator Gen. Rafael Trujillo pushed the free-land program in hopes of creating a vegetable industry and bringing lighter-skinned genes to his country's bloodline. A similar Trujillo plan brought Jewish Holocaust refugees to the country's north coast from Europe to set up a dairy industry.

Postwar Japan liked the idea; it was desperate to house its soldiers and families returning from a collapsed empire. So from 1956 to 1959, some 1,300 Japanese made the 30-day, 8,000 mile voyage across the oceans.

The Nishio family was given arid, salty soil near the Haitian border.

""There was no water. There were so many mosquitoes. It was a disgrace,"" said Yoko Nishio, who arrived as a teenager and is now a 65-year-old grandmother.

Her family struggled to farm and sell crops to Dominicans unaccustomed to eating vegetables. Four years later, at age 20, her father demanded she find a husband to support her. She married a Japanese soil engineer and moved to the Constanza valley, where the land was more fertile, though overgrown with pine trees.

But in May 1961 Trujillo was assassinated, kicking off four years of violence and political turbulence that would end with a U.S. invasion. Nishio's parents moved to Brazil. She never saw them again.

Most of the other Japanese left too, including nearly all of the 37 families in Constanza. Only some 257 immigrants stayed past the early 1960s, according to the committee organizing the community's 50th anniversary celebration this month.

Ashamed of their failure to farm the difficult land and crushed by the breakup of their families, some committed suicide, said committee spokesman Yoshihiro Iguchi.

In 2000, Nishio and more than 170 other immigrants sued the Japanese government, claiming they were deceived into leaving Japan and taking bad land.

Japan settled the lawsuit this month, promising to pay up to $17,000 to each plaintiff as well as $10,000 to emigrants who did not take part in the suit.

And on Friday, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi issued a formal apology, ""for causing immense suffering due to the government's response at the time.""

Still, for some who stuck it out, the Dominican Republic is a comfortable home.

""It's good here. The mountain climate is very similar to where we're from,"" said Waki, a thin, 51-year-old man with skin tanned reddish-brown from five decades in the Caribbean sun.

The half-dozen families who stayed in Constanza blend prewar Japanese culture with their modern Dominican lives.

Even the youngest speak a dated version of the mother tongue. In Japan, a camera is a ""kamera,"" but here it's still a ""shashinki.""

Koki Sato, a 42-year-old vegetable farmer, swears in Spanish but makes his daughters watch Japanese television via satellite to keep them connected to their ancestral language and culture.

The next generation of Japanese-Dominicans will now inherit the land. Waki's fields of ornamental flowers will pass to his 29-year-old son and Dominican daughter-in-law.

It will complete a journey begun by Waki's mother, Choko, from her childhood in Japanese-occupied China, back to Japan and then to this Caribbean island five decades ago. At 75, she looked across the wide valley where her family once struggled.

""It is paradise for us,"" she said.",https://www.foxnews.com/story/japanese-families-return-to-dominican-republic,N/A

“My deepest sympathies go out to the families of the American tourists who have passed away. Their recent and tragic deaths appear to have had a dramatic impact on travel to the Dominican Republic,” Ponti said. “Our analysis of leisure travel shows a striking correlation.”

""It amounts to a dreadful image crisis for the Dominican Republic because the USA is the number one source market for tourism to the destination and its economy is highly dependent on foreign visitors,” he continued.

In 2018, the Dominican Republic welcomed over 6.5 million visitors from around the globe.

An expert on Dominican tourism told Fox News last week that the country should anticipate a temporary decline in visitors this summer, particularly from the US.

The official spoke on the condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.

""I think the (downward) curve started in June and will continue in July before starting to recover again in August and September,"" the source said.

He warned, however, that if Dominican authorities do not determine the cause of death for the victims, and soon, it could potentially be just as damaging to the island's tourism industry, akin to the May 2005 disappearance of American teenager Natalie Holloway in Aruba.

""If this is not figured out, it will be a catastrophe [for the country],"" he claimed.

Meanwhile, flight bookings are reportedly up for other Caribbean islands – including Jamaica (26 percent,) the Bahamas (44.5 percent,) and Aruba (31.3 percent,) Fox Business reports.

As for some of the major domestic carriers, Delta Air Lines is allowing passengers to rebook or cancel their Dominican Republic travel plans without incurring additional fees.

Other major airlines, including United and American, have confirmed to Fox News that the carriers are dealing with passengers on a “case by case” basis.

“With safety as our top priority, we continue to monitor the events in the Dominican Republic,” wrote United Airlines in a statement obtained by Fox News. “We have not issued a travel waiver at this time, but will work with customers on a case by case basis.”

Southwest’s standing policy, meanwhile, is that customers may cancel travel plans up to one hour before the scheduled flight for “full store credit,” travel advisory or not.

"Bodega clerk Jose Alba leaves NYC 'afraid for his life,' mulls move back to Dominican Republic: report","New York City bodega clerk Jose Alba has reportedly left the Big Apple and is mulling a more permanent move back to his native Dominican Republic after murder charges against him were finally dropped.

Alba, 61, no longer works at the Blue Moon convenience store in Manhattan, where he was attacked behind the counter on July 1 by 35-year-old Austin Simon.

Surveillance video shows Simon threatened Alba, came behind the counter and shoved him into a wall before Alba reached for a knife and fatally stabbed the six-foot tall man. Despite claiming self-defense, Alba was charged with murder.

Simon’s girlfriend apparently grew enraged with Alba for taking back items out of her daughter’s hand that they couldn’t pay for using her electronic welfare card. Simon came back into the store wanting to fight Alba, but Alba tried to avoid further confrontation before he was attacked, according to court documents.

NYC JUDGE DROPS MURDER CHARGE AGAINST BODEGA WORKER AFTER MANHATTAN DA BACKTRACKS

The girlfriend, who has not been charged, also reportedly stabbed Alba in an arm during the incident.

""He doesn’t work here anymore. He’s getting ready to move out of the country,"" the manager of the store recently told the New York Post. ""He doesn’t come [to the store anymore], but we go visit him at home from time to time.""

Francisco Marte, the head of a bodega association assisting Alba, told the Post that Alba is still processing the attack and its aftermath. He was jailed at the notorious Rikers Island for about a week before prosecutors cut a deal lowering his $250,000 bail amid widespread outcry from New York City’s Dominican community.

Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s office later backtracked and dropped the murder charge against Alba on July 19, saying in a memo that prosecutors ""cannot prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was not justified in his use of deadly physical force.""

Among many other supporters, New York City Mayor Eric Adams and former NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton had publicly decried the initial charging decision, saying Alba acted in self-defense to thwart what appeared to be either an attempt on his own life or a robbery in progress.

Marte said that Alba is now spending time in upstate New York before heading to the Dominican Republic.

""He is taking a hiatus right now,"" Marte said. ""He went upstate to get away from everything.""

""He is not going back to work at the bodega. He is taking a break fighting with his trauma, and he said he is afraid for his life,"" Marte added. ""He is trying to get back to normal, but he said it’s very hard when you have flashbacks of what happened. We are getting him professional help, and then [Alba and his family] decide whether he goes back to the DR for good or just spends some time there.""",https://www.foxnews.com/us/bodega-clerk-jose-alba-leaves-nyc-afraid-his-life-mulls-move-back-dominican-republic-report,N/A
Bodies of Maryland couple found dead in Dominican Republic returned to US,"The bodies of a Maryland couple who died on May 30 while vacationing in the Dominican Republic were returned to the United States on Tuesday, according to their family lawyer, Steven Bullock.

Edward Holmes, 63, and Cynthia Day, 49, were engaged and enjoying a five-day vacation at the Bahia Principe Hotel in La Romana; their bodies were found by hotel staff after they failed to check out of the hotel on the day they were to fly back to the United States.

EX-RED SOX SLUGGER DAVID ORTIZ LEAVES DOMINICAN REPUBLIC HOSPITAL FOR BOSTON AFTER BAR SHOOTING

Autopsy results said the couple died from pulmonary edema, or excess fluid in the lungs, according to Dominican officials. A full toxicology report is pending.

A slew of recent deaths in the Dominican Republic have forced the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the FBI to team up with experts from several international agencies to assist Dominican authorities in investigating the resort. This, despite Dominican officials' insistence the deaths were due to natural causes.

Just five days before the bodies of Holmes and Day were found, another woman, vacationing with her husband at the same resort in an adjacent hotel also died of pulmonary edema.

Miranda Schaup-Werner, 41, a psychotherapist from Allentown, Pa., was celebrating her ninth wedding anniversary with her husband when she collapsed at the minibar at the Bahia Principe Bouganville hotel after having a drink.

Schaup-Werner's husband told Dominican authorities she ""suffered from heart conditions in the past,"" the Bahia Principe resort group told Fox News in a statement.

Jay McDonald, a family spokesman for Daniel Werner, Miranda's husband, said his sister was diagnosed with inflammation around the heart 15 years ago, and sought treatment for it, but has since been medically cleared.

The family disagree with authorities' efforts to pin her death on a previous health condition.

“That was beyond coincidence,” McDonald said, responding to the Maryland couple's death. “They died five days after, and the cause was determined to be the same; this just puts this whole thing through the stratosphere – something is going on, and we want to know what it is.”

Also before the most recent deaths, a Delaware woman, Tammy Lawrence-Daley, has alleged that she was attacked by a man dressed in a hotel uniform at the Majestic Elegance resort in Punta Cana, where she was staying with her husband and two friends in January.

Lawrence-Daley, who posted to Facebook a graphic photo of her face, badly bruised and swollen from the alleged incident, said she was brutally beaten and thrown in a maintenance closet by her attacker, where she was found the next day by hotel staff.

“I was strangled multiple times to unconsciousness. My lifeless body was drug down concrete stairs to an underground wastewater area. I was kicked in the head, I was beaten with a club. And then strangled again for the kill; at which time he disposed of my body into an area I refer to as the ‘hole.' I was unconscious multiple times during this savage attack, so I have no idea what else was done to me during that time,” she wrote.

A fourth U.S. citizen also died recently in the Dominican Republic, his family said on Sunday, telling Fox News they became suspicious about his death after learning about Schaup-Werner.

Robert Bell Wallace, 67, from California, was staying at the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in Punta Cana to attend his stepson's wedding, almost a month before the other incidents occurred. On April 11, he had a scotch from the hotel's minibar and became suddenly ill.

""He started feeling very sick, he had blood in his urine and stool right afterward,"" his niece, Chloe Arnold told Fox News.

Wallace was seen by a hotel doctor who then decided on April 13 that he needed to be hospitalized. He died the next day, and Dominican authorities have yet to give the family a cause of death, Arnold said.

The U.S. State Department issued a travel advisory for the Dominican Republic in April, urging those visiting there to “exercise increased caution … due to crime.”

“Violent crime, including armed robbery, homicide and sexual assault is a concern throughout the Dominican Republic,” the advisory said. “The wide availability of weapons, the use and trade of illicit drugs, and a weak criminal justice system contribute to the high level of criminality on the broader scale.”

"Lincoln Memorial vandalized by student from Kyrgyz Republic, police say","A student from the Kyrgyz Republic was arrested Monday for allegedly using a penny to engrave the letters “HYPT MAEK” into the fifth pillar on the north side of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, Fox 5 DC reported.

Nurtilek Bakirov, 21, was arrested and charged with malicious destruction of property, the report said. If convicted, the maximum penalty he faces is 10 years in prison and a $25,000 fine.

The report — citing U.S. Park Police — said an officer caught Bakirov the act.

NYC corrections captain at Rikers dies in Dominican Republic after Brazilian butt lift from bogus doc: report,"An NYC Department of Correction captain died reportedly after traveling to the Dominican Republic to receive a Brazilian butt lift from a phony doctor once indicted for operating without a medical license.

Tandra Bowser-Williams, a 49-year-old Corrections Captain at Rikers Island, suffered a massive stroke just days after jetting off to Santo Domingo to receive a fat transfer surgery from plastic surgeon, Dr. Hector Cabral, on May 13, her husband, Curtis Williams, recently recounted to N.Y. Daily News.

Cabral was previously indicted in March 2011 under former New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman on 10 counts of operating without a medical license and fraud and conspiracy charges.

He was accused of charging for consultations and medical examinations at med spas and beauty parlors in New York before luring unsuspecting patients with bargain prices to the Dominican Republic for discount cosmetic surgeries, which ultimately left many women permanently disfigured.

ADAMS' NYC JAIL CHIEF RESISTS FEDERAL TAKEOVER AMID SCANDALS, TRANSGENDER INMATE RAPE CONVICTION

Bowser-Williams’ husband said his partner since 1996 was confident in Cabral’s abilities despite his past indictment.

""Her exact words to me were, ‘you’re gonna love Dr. Cabral’s work.’ I didn’t care one way or another. I accepted my wife the way she was,"" he said. ""Everybody is distraught. She was the heart, the lifeline of the family. The heartbeat.""

The Daily News reported that Cabral ultimately cut a plea deal with prosecutors that guaranteed no jail time. He was fined $5,000 and was ordered to pay $23,055 in restitution and complete 250 hours of community service in the Dominican Republic, according to the newspaper.

Cabral returned to Santo Domingo and opened Centro Internacional de Cirugia Plastica Avanzada, where Bowser-Williams received her recent surgery.

Her husband said he received a call a day later from a nurse at United Hearts Clinic, where she had been moved about a mile away after the procedure and ultimately died before Williams could arrive to the Caribbean in time to be by her side.

In 2017, the New York City Department of Health warned of eight patients in New York City and two in Connecticut who returned from ""lipo-tourism"" trips from the Dominican Republic with dangerous bacterial infections and other serious symptoms including abdominal abscesses, pain, wound discharge, and fever. No deaths had been immediately reported in connection to those cases.

Daily News reported that Cabral’s clinic footed the bill for Williams’ travel to the Dominican Republic, as well as other costs related to his wife’s death, including paying the local funeral home to have her body embalmed. The newspaper said Bowser-Williams’ death does not appear to be under investigation.

"20,000 flee latest fighting in Central African Republic","Gunmen looted humanitarian compounds as fighting gripped the Central African Republic town of Bria while more than 20,000 people have fled to a nearby U.N. peacekeeping base, authorities said Friday.

Concerns are mounting that sectarian violence is again spiraling out of control in the country, even in places that previously were spared during the conflict that began in late 2013.

At least 20 people have been killed and several dozen wounded since the unrest in Bria began on Tuesday, said U.N. mission spokesman Herve Verhoosel.

He told The Associated Press that fighting was focused on the Bria airport Friday morning between rebel groups. Meanwhile, U.N. troops intervened to stop youth from looting and burning houses in an area where most humanitarian organizations are based. More than 50 aid workers were now sheltering at the U.N. base, he said.

Verhoosel called the situation ""calm but unpredictable,"" with peacekeepers deployed in key areas of town.

The U.N. mission ""deeply regrets that one more time, civilians pay the highest price,"" he said.

Earlier, the U.N. humanitarian agency's chief of office for the country, Joseph Inganji, told the AP that armed groups came to humanitarian compounds in Bria and pillaged a warehouse. ""There's fighting taking place but we don't know who's fighting who,"" he said.

Attacks also targeted places of worship and government buildings, the medical charity Doctors Without Borders said in a statement, adding that at least 44 casualties had been treated at the local hospital since Monday. ""These are stirring up ethnic and religious divides.""

Bria in November was the site of fierce clashes between two splinter groups of the mostly Muslim rebel movement called Seleka that has battled with Christian militia fighters. Human Rights Watch said at the time that at least 14 people were killed.

Other previously calm parts of the country have seen deadly fighting in recent days.

Since May 8 more than 150 people, including six U.N. peacekeepers, have been killed in attacks in the southeastern town of Bangassou, the southern town of Alinadao and in Bria, according to the U.N., which has warned the death toll may rise.

In the capital, Bangui, tensions were running high. People spoke of the fighting in Bangassou and Bria in hushed tones, turning up the radio whenever the names of the towns came on. Businesses in the Muslim neighborhood of PK5 were closed in protest of the violence in Bangassou, where Muslims reportedly were targeted.

Bribery scandal met with near-silence in Dominican Republic,"next Image 1 of 2

prev Image 2 of 2

One of the most sprawling corruption scandals in modern history has deep roots in the Dominican Republic: The Brazilian company behind the operation placed its international ""bribery bureau"" in this Caribbean country and shoveled out nearly $100 million in bribes to local officials.

Yet five months after the scheme was exposed, nobody has been charged here and no corrupt officials have been named — infuriating both political reformers and opposition parties. By contrast, investigations in Brazil, Colombia, Panama and Peru have produced hundreds of charges, including cases against former presidents.

Government critics hope the silence will break Friday when Odebrecht is expected to reveal the recipients of its bribes in the Dominican Republic under a deal that protected the Brazilian construction company from prosecution and allowed it to keep doing business in the country.

Odebrecht's executives confessed to U.S. prosecutors that they paid around $788 million to officials in 10 Latin American countries and two more in Africa in order to get multimillion-dollar contracts with local governments.

They said they spent $92 million on bribes in the Dominican Republic alone as the company won 17 contracts to build highways, dams and a big coal-burning power plant. One of the key figures in the scheme worked as President Danilo Medina's adviser in two presidential campaigns.

When Brazil's own corruption investigations began to turn up the heat on Odebrecht in 2014, the company moved its office in charge of handling bribes — the innocuously named Bureau of Structural Operations — to Santo Domingo, apparently to distance it from Brazilian prosecutors.

Attorney General Jean Alain Rodriguez, a member of the ruling party's central committee, struck a deal with Odebrecht for a $184 million fine and an agreement to protect its executives from prosecution in exchange for information that might be used to prosecute local graft recipients. It's the first deal of its kind Odebrecht reached outside Brazil.

That has prompted anti-corruption activists to hold marches protesting government inaction and to file court cases demanding an independent investigation. Many say they are pessimistic that Friday's expected announcement will reveal the full extent of corruption in the Dominican Republic.

""For Odebrecht, the Dominican Republic wasn't just any country,"" said Manuel Robles, a member of the Green Movement, a group created to protest against corruption and is demanding an independent probe into the bribery scheme and audits of all Odebrecht's local contracts.

""The Dominican people have been vilely affected by a business mafia complicit with politicians and thieving bureaucrats,"" Robles said.

Odebrecht's contracts in the Dominican Republic since 2001 totaled $5 billion — 7 percent of the annual GDP in a country where most people earn $200 a month or less.

""You can follow the money through here. There must be records, information,"" said Rosalia Sosa, director of the activist group Citizen Participation, which has called for a more thorough investigation.

Fifteen of the contracts were signed during the 13-year tenure of Medina's Dominican Liberation Party, now led by former President Leonel Fernandez. The party's popularity is based largely on Latin America's highest rate of economic growth and extensive social programs.

Fernandez has refused to discuss the bribes. Medina in February defended the deal that allowed Odebrecht executives to avoid prosecution.

The Medina administration's signature infrastructure project is a $2 billion, 720-megawatt coal-burning plant about 38 miles (60 kilometers) west of Santo Domingo that was contracted to Odebrecht in 2013 even though the company's bid was the highest of all those submitted and more than $500 million above the limit set by the country's Congress.

In January, Medina created a special commission to investigate the bidding process.

""I'm absolutely certain that the bidding committee and the technical teams carried out a transparent process and awarded the contract to the party that won it, the one that made the best offer,"" said Ruben Bichara, head of the Dominican Republic's state energy regulator.

The plant is expected to go into operation this year.

A major focus of critics here is Joao Santana, who worked on Medina's 2012 campaign and was arrested in Brazil last year while advising on Medina's re-election effort. He also had been a campaign strategist for several presidents in other countries: Luiz Inacio Lula Da Silva and Dilma Roussef in Brazil, Hugo Chavez and Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela, and Mauricio Funes in El Salvador.

Medina's government has said investigations will clear Medina and his aides of any wrongdoing and show they received no money from Odebrecht.

""We financed our own campaign and we paid Joao Santana ourselves,"" Medina said in March.

Peru's attorney general is investigating three former presidents, has jailed five government officials and has requested the jailing of former President Alejandro Toledo for allegedly receiving $20 million in Odebrecht bribes to help the company win a highway project. Toledo is a fugitive last seen in the U.S. Prosecutors say 100 former officials could be jailed in the case.

Venezuelan authorities have frozen Odebrecht's assets in the country, searched its offices in Caracas and asked Brazilian and Swiss officials for information. They have brought no charges, however, and witnesses in court testimony have implicated Maduro. The president has not commented publicly on the allegations. The government has no commented either. Odebrecht executives confessed they paid $98 million in bribes in Venezuela.

Ecuador has detained a business magnate and a former electricity minister and is reviewing 30 contracts awarded to Odebrecht since 1980. Odebrecht says it paid $33.5 million in bribes in Ecuador. It's been banned from the country due to the scandal.

The 88-page report released Tuesday details the atrocities committed by both sides in the impoverished country and urged the re-establishment of a legal and penal system to stop the wave of crime and violence and to begin trying those behind the massacres.

""The leaders of the violence and its perpetrators of mass human rights violations are known, we have proof and the government and international community have to take this opportunity and arrest them and end the organized violence,"" said Florent Geel, the director of the federation's Africa Desk, lamenting the lack of jails or security for judges in the country.

The Central African Republic has been rocked by unrest since March 2013 when a largely Muslim alliance of rebel groups known as the Seleka overthrew President Francois Bozize. More than a million people, nearly a quarter of the population, have been displaced by the violence pitting Muslim rebels against Christian militias known as the anti-Balaka.

""Seleka and anti-Balaka forces mirror one another in the horror of the acts that they have perpetrated in the context of a conflict that has become so vile that more people are killed than injured,"" warned the report, which was researched with two local human rights organizations between the summer of 2013 and February 2014.

After the Seleka were forced out of the capital and back to the northern and eastern parts of the country, enclaves of besieged Muslims civilians were left at the mercy of the anti-Balaka militias, who soon switched their targets from just those allied to the rebels to all Muslims.

The report's investigators discovered that the militias were in many cases led by members of the former government military and organized by politicians close to the deposed president. One militia leader told researchers ""they all have to leave or die.""

Before the conflict, there were some 800,000 Muslims in Central African Republic and now only about 20,000 remain, scattered around in 16 different enclaves surrounded by hostile militias. It is a situation reminiscent of Bosnia in the 1990s when Serbs attempted to ethnically cleanse Muslim areas, said the report.

There are currently 5,000 African troops and 2,000 French troops in the country which have largely taken over the role of maintaining order, following the disintegration of the government's army.

Aside from France, the report said the global community has largely been indifferent to the plight of the country.

For its part the United States announced late Monday another $51 million in humanitarian support for Central African Republic to provide clean water, food, emergency health services and relief supplies as well as programs to reunite lost family members.

But ultimately, the report maintained, the key to saving the country is to halt the cycle of violence by ending the impunity of those behind it and restoring of the country's justice system, something that can only be done with more troops.

Despite the installation of President Catherine Samba-Panza after the Seleka was pushed out of the capital, there has been little evidence of a central authority and even the most brazen crimes go unpunished. Militia leaders arrested by international forces are soon at large again, said the report. It recommends the creation of an interim legal system -- including building functional jails.

Help may come with a new 12,000-strong U.N. force set to start arriving in September, but even that number may not be enough, said Geel of human rights organization. He said Central African Republic ""could become a sanctuary for armed groups, instability and mercenaries so it has to be fixed quickly.""",https://www.foxnews.com/world/central-african-republic-at-risk-of-genocide-group-says,N/A
Central African Republic killings send entire town fleeing,"Scores of blackened homes dot this town where more than 41,000 people have fled for their lives.

Deadly sectarian violence that has gripped Central African Republic since 2013 is surging again, even spreading to parts of the country that once had been spared. The number of people displaced could reach half a million by month's end, the United Nations says, a level not seen in more than three years.

Some people have had little time to escape.

""I have nothing. No sheets, no covers. I have nothing,"" says 50-year-old Marie Edith Mambleka.

She sits on the ground in a squalid camp for the displaced, surrounded by people constructing makeshift shelters. Her son was killed when the clashes erupted in Bria last week. Her house was destroyed.

She has yet to bury her son. ""We suffer a lot,"" she says. ""We don't even have the ability to recover our dead.""

The United Nations says about 300 people have been killed and 200 wounded in the past two weeks alone in Bria and a handful of other towns.

The upsurge in violence in Central African Republic began late last year. The government, with the support of a 12,000-strong U.N. peacekeeping mission, has been trying to calm the country that descended into sectarian fighting in 2013 when Muslim rebels overthrew the Christian president.

But large parts of one of the world's poorest countries remain unstable, and the U.N. mission has said it doesn't have enough troops to protect civilians.

In Bria, more than 20 people were killed in the recent fighting between armed groups, likely elements of a mostly Muslim Seleka faction clashing with elements of Christian anti-Balaka rebels. Dozens were wounded.

The U.N. humanitarian agency said the unprecedented violence emptied Bria of its population, sending an ""uninterrupted stream"" of residents toward makeshift camps.

The largest has been set up near the local U.N. base, swelling to over 25,000 people in just two days.

Elsewhere, hundreds of people are staying in the courtyard of the local hospital, seeking respite from the blazing sun under a large tree. Small cooking fires fill the air with smoke.

Scores of other people fled to a local church.

""Christians thought God would protect us,"" says 61-year-old Matthias Mackayendji, gesturing at the scene around him. Children are everywhere. Women chop wood and rinse beef next to a crude fire.

As Mackayendji speaks, torrential rain begins to fall. Water soaks the mats and housewares strewn on the ground. The deluge drives everyone, sweating, into the darkened church, where the pastor quietly chimes in.

""They didn't attack another armed group. They attacked the population. Civilians,"" Pastor Andre Sandje laments.

He says his focus has been on offering moral and spiritual support to those seeking shelter.

Mackayendji says he is too scared to return home until the fighters have been disarmed or driven out of town.

""They are cruel. They don't have pity,"" he says. ""They kill people without cause.""

Even though the armed groups are divided along religious lines, both Muslims and Christians alike are huddled in the camps. Several Christians shared stories of how their Muslim neighbors saved them or hid them.

They are now united in misery. ""There's been too much loss,"" says 49-year-old Galbert Ndemaba, who is too scared to return home and doesn't know if his home is still standing. He pleads for help from Europe and the United States. ""Please, think of us.""

The humanitarian appeal for aid for Central African Republic is only 16 percent funded. The U.N. humanitarian agency warns that aid stocks have quickly diminished and there is a food emergency.

Now the rainy season's downpours are turning the camps for the displaced into pits of mud, which means the risk of epidemics is strong, says Oxfam's field manager in Bria, Noel Zigani.

""The living conditions are very hard for the displaced,"" Zigani says, ""even unhuman.""",https://www.foxnews.com/world/central-african-republic-killings-send-entire-town-fleeing,N/A
"Central African Republic violence 'highly worrying,' UN says","A series of attacks in remote areas of Central African Republic have forced more than 15,000 people to flee their homes over the past week while at least 130 are feared dead, authorities said Tuesday.

Among the victims are six U.N. peacekeepers, marking the deadliest month for the mission since it began in 2014.

The U.N. high commissioner for human rights warned that the violence in areas previously spared major sectarian bloodshed was ""highly worrying.""

""The hard-earned relative calm in Bangui and some of the bigger towns in CAR risks being eclipsed by the descent of some rural areas into increasing sectarian violence, with defenseless civilians — as usual — paying the highest price,"" Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein said.

Gen. Balla Keita, commander of the U.N. mission, said at least 30 people were killed and 32 wounded when militia fighters from a predominantly Christian group known as the anti-Balaka attacked the southeastern town of Bangassou over the weekend.

It was the first death toll given since the attack apart from the confirmation of the peacekeepers' deaths. Humanitarian agencies have called it impossible to retrieve corpses from the streets because of the ongoing insecurity.

The U.N. mission noted that ""deliberate attacks in Bangassou, with heavy weaponry, seem to be well-planned as the perpetrators made access very difficult by destroying bridges and blocking all accessible roads to town,"" said Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for the U.N. secretary-general.

Humanitarian agencies indicated more than 7,200 people fled Bangassou after the weekend fighting sparked by the anti-Balaka attack. An unknown number of people fled toward the border with Congo.

Meanwhile, the U.N. said unconfirmed reports suggest up to 100 were killed in attacks in the town of Alindao. Some 8,500 people have been displaced by violence there, Dujarric said.

These areas of Central African Republic did not experience major violence during the sectarian bloodshed that erupted in late 2013 and ultimately forced nearly all of the Muslims in the capital, Bangui, to flee to the country's north and beyond to neighboring Chad.

Fighting has mounted, however, and last month Doctors Without Borders warned of ""levels of violence that have not been seen since the peak of the conflict in 2014.""

Zeid, the U.N. human rights chief, said the death toll prior to the attacks on Alindao and Bangassou already was at least 121 since March.

In Bangui, dozens of people held a demonstration against the violence in the southeast. Prime Minister Simplice Mathieu Sarandji assured those protesting that the government would punish those responsible.

""There are widows and orphans in front of us today,"" he said. ""These people only want one thing: that justice is done.""

Children suffering in Central African Republic 5 years on,"next Image 1 of 2

prev Image 2 of 2

Children are bearing the brunt of five years of fighting in Central African Republic as thousands are trapped in armed groups, many suffer sexual violence, tens of thousands go hungry and one in four have fled their homes, the United Nations children's agency said Friday.

The new report pleads for millions in funding for one of the world's most ""neglected"" crises.

Deeply impoverished Central African Republic has faced interreligious and intercommunal fighting since 2013, when predominantly Muslim Seleka rebels seized power in the capital, Bangui. Mostly Christian anti-Balaka militias fought back, resulting in thousands of people killed and hundreds of thousands displaced.

Violence has intensified and spread in the past year after a period of relative peace as armed groups battle over lands rich in gold, diamonds and uranium.

Fighters often target civilians rather than each other, attacking health facilities and schools, mosques and churches and camps for displaced people, the UNICEF report said. At least half of the more than 640,000 people displaced are children.

""This crisis is taking place in one of the poorest and least developed countries in the world, and one of the most dangerous for humanitarian workers,"" said Christine Muhigana, UNICEF's Representative in Central African Republic. ""Conditions for children are desperate.""

Children are often separated from their parents amid the violence, becoming vulnerable to armed groups who now control four-fifths of the country, UNICEF said. Thousands of children, mostly boys, are thought to be in armed groups. Thousands more, most of them girls, are sexually exploited and abused.

One former child soldier told the U.N. agency that ""you are given a weapon and you use it. . If told to kill or attack, you do it."" Other former child soldiers, freed from the armed groups, later returned so they could make money, he said.

""Whether by the ex-Seleka or the anti-Balaka, children's rights are trampled on,"" said Olivier Mirindi-Chiza, chief of UNICEF's field office in the city of Bambari.

Frustration with the fighting spilled over this week as opposition parties and civil society groups demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Simplice Mathieu Sarandji's government.

""The people are helpless,"" said Ferdinand Alexandre Nguendet, president of the collective known as Rassemblement pour la Republique.

The groups also called for part of the U.N. peacekeeping mission to withdraw, alleging that Pakistani and Mauritanian contingents didn't react to a deadly attack earlier this month.

More than 42 people, including two priests, were killed on Nov. 15 as rebels with the group Union for Peace in the Central African Republic attacked a displaced persons camp in Alindao in the central part of the country, according to witness Cardinal Dieudonne Nzapalainga.

The U.N. peacekeeping mission chief, Parfait Onanga-Anyanga, later acknowledged that the mission ""unfortunately ... was not able to react to prevent this type of violence.""

And in a speech days after the attack, the prime minister acknowledged the government's limits. ""I knew that we did not have all the necessary means to protect our people; our defense and security forces were not well-armed,"" he said.

Young people, both Christians and Muslims, in Bambari have been organizing joint marches calling for peace, Mirindi-Chiza with UNICEF said.

""I believe the only way towards that peace is through dialogue,"" Mirindi-Chiza said. ""It won't be perfect, but the killing will stop, families can go back home, and children - the future of this country - can finally get the opportunity they so desperately need.""

"Czech Republic in talks on EU oil embargo exemption, PM says","The Czech Republic will seek an exemption period to the European Union's proposed embargo of Russian oil, gaining time for pipeline capacities to be increased, Prime Minister Petr Fiala said on Wednesday.

""We are ready to support this decision (on sanctions including oil), given the Czech Republic will have some postponement until capacity is increased in oil pipelines which can deliver oil to the Czech Republic,"" Fiala said.

GERMANY WILL SUPPORT RUSSIAN OIL EMBARGO AFTER SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING DEPENDENCE: REPORT

""We are trying to get that postponement for two, maybe three years.""

The European Commission on Wednesday proposed a phased oil embargo on Russia, along with other tough measures to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. The measures include phasing out supplies of Russian crude oil within six months and refined products by the end of 2022.

The Czech Republic has been seeking an increase to capacity of the TAL pipeline - running from Italy via Austria to Germany - which is waiting for the approval by Bavarian authorities.

Fiala said he would debate the issue with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz during a visit to Berlin on Thursday.

SLOVAKIA SAYS IT WILL SEEK EXEMPTION FROM ANY EU EMBARGO ON RUSSIAN OIL

Czech Republic opens tender for new nuclear reactor,"The Czech Republic launched a tender on Thursday to build a new reactor at the Dukovany nuclear plant as the country aims to increase nuclear power generation.

Three companies — U.S. Westinghouse, France’s EDF and Korea’s KHNP — have passed a Czech government security appraisal and are expected to bid for the lucrative project.

CHERNOBYL UNDER SIEGE IN UKRAINE WAR: RUSSIANS HOLDING MORE THAN 200 EMPLOYEES HOSTAGE

The project’s estimated cost of around 6 billion euros ($6.6 billion) is the biggest single investment in the Czech Republic, Industry and Trade Minister Jozef Sikela said.

Russian and Chinese companies, including Russia’s energy giant Rosatom and China’s CNG, have been excluded from the tender on security grounds.

Prime Minister Petr Fiala said Russian participation in the key project for the country’s energy security was ""unimaginable"" following the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine.

The new reactor will complement Dukovany’s four 510-megawatt units that were completed in the late 1980s. It should become operational by 2036, Fiala said.

""We want to make another step for the Czech Republic to become energy self-sufficient,"" Fiala said. He said more such projects will follow but didn’t disclose details.

The winning bidder is expected to be selected by 2024 with a construction permit to be issued by 2029, Fiala said.

US NUCLEAR EXPERTS 'MINDFUL BUT NOT FEARFUL' OF RADIOACTIVE THREAT AMID RUSSIA INVASION OF UKRAINE

The Czech Republic already relies on six nuclear reactors to generate more than a third of its total electricity. Besides the four in Dukovany, state-controlled power company CEZ operates another two 1,000-megawatt reactors at the Temelin plant. CEZ will be in charge of the tender.

CEZ chief executive Daniel Benes said participants will have to submit preliminary bids by the end of November and then will have another 20 months to complete the final bids. A deal with the winner will be signed in 2024.

Unlike its western neighbors Austria and Germany, the Czech Republic is doubling down on nuclear power and renewable energy sources after deciding to phase out coal as a fuel for energy generation by 2033 in order to reduce carbon emissions.

Another two European Union countries in Central Europe, Slovakia and Hungary, have also been working to expand nuclear power production.

Daughter of Army vet who died at Dominican resort: Funeral home 'pressured' me to make a decision about my father's remains,"The daughter of an American veteran who died at a Dominican Republic resort said she's tried for a year to get answers about her father's death to no avail.

Meghan Arnold's father, 41-year-old Army veteran Chris Palmer, died suddenly in his room at the Villa Cocatal Palma resort in the Dominican Republic in April 2018. From the moment she learned of her father's death, Arnold said she began contacting anyone who might have information about the circumstances.

""Obviously his death was a complete shock to us because he was completely healthy,"" she told Harris Faulker during a Friday appearance on ""Outnumbered Overtime.""

""From the very beginning, I was contacting anybody I knew - the U.S. Embassy, the Dominican embassy, friends, co-workers, anybody.""

DOMINICAN REPUBLIC OFFICIALS DOWNPLAY SPATE OF AMERICAN TOURIST DEATHS IN CARIBBEAN NATION

Eventually, she found out that his body had been moved to a funeral home. When she got in contact with the facility, she said they pressured her to make a decision about what would be done with her father.

""Immediately, I was pressured to make a decision whether it was going to be cremation or embalming or I was told he would be stuck there,"" she continued.

Arnold said she was persistent in asking for a toxicology report to be done on her father to find out his cause of death and didn't want to make a decision about his remains until she could determine what exactly happened. She said she was told that the toxicology results would be included with the death certificate, which could take months.

""Any time I would try to return calls to try to get more information, it was always just dead ends,"" she said.

FAMILY AND FRIENDS OF WOMAN WHO DIED IN DOMINICAN REPUBLIC CLAIM AUTHORITIES ARE LYING ABOUT PAST 'SEVERAL HEART ATTACKS'

""Nobody had help for me and then slowly as the process began to switch over to him finally being brought home, the calls immediately stopped. I have not heard from anyone from that day on,"" she continued.

Arnold decided to have her father's body embalmed to be returned to their home in Kansas, then cremated once it was returned. His official cause of death was determined to be pulmonary edema - when fluid fills the lungs - and that he died of a heart attack.

His death, and that of another woman, 69-year-old Barbara Diane Maser-Mitchell, are now being newly scrutinized after nine other people suddenly died under similar circumstances at Dominican resorts. Most died of heart attacks despite being largely healthy and without pre-existing conditions.

Dominican officials have downplayed the deaths and asserted that the vacationers died of natural causes.

“It’s all a hysteria against the Dominican Republic, to hurt our tourism, this is a very competitive industry and we get millions of tourists, we are a popular destination,” Ministry of Public Health spokesman Carlos Suero told Fox News on Wednesday.

Ex-Red Sox slugger David Ortiz leaves Dominican Republic hospital for Boston after bar shooting,"David Ortiz is on his way to Boston on Monday after the former Red Sox slugger affectionately known as “Big Papi” was ambushed by a gunman at a bar in the Dominican Republic, investigators said.

The 43-year-old retired athlete had been in stable condition in intensive care at a Santo Domingo hospital after doctors removed his gallbladder and part of his intestine.

His spokesman, Leo López, said Ortiz’s liver also was damaged in the shooting Sunday night.

The Red Sox offered “all available resources” and sent an aircraft to bring him back to Boston.

“He’s on the Mount Rushmore of Boston sports,” said Eddie Romero, the team’s assistant general manager.

DAVID ORTIZ, FORMER RED SOX SLUGGER, WOUNDED IN DOMINICAN REPUBLIC BAR SHOOTING

Ortiz’s father, Leo, said he will be transferred to Boston so he can be with his wife and the Red Sox medical team.

“He is resting,” the elder Ortiz said. “Big Papi will be around for a long time.”

Ortiz was at the Dial Bar and Lounge in Santo Domingo on Sunday night when a gunman approached from behind and shot him at close range in the torso, officials said.

The gunman was not immediately identified or arrested, and the motive for the shooting was under investigation, with investigators trying to determine whether Ortiz was the target.

The operator of the motorcycle that was carrying the gunman was captured and beaten by a crowd of people at the bar, the investigators said.

The bar is in a bustling nightlife district packed with dance clubs and expensive bars that Ortiz is known to frequent.

Eliezer Salvador, who was at the scene, said the gunman said nothing, just fired once. Salvador then drove a wounded Ortiz to the hospital, telling reporters they had a brief conversation in the car as he urged the baseball great to stay calm and breathe.

“Do you have any problems with anyone?” Salvador recalled asking him, to which Ortiz replied: “No, my brother, I’ve never wronged anyone.”

Salvador held up Ortiz’s bloody belongings for reporters, along with some of his jewelry. He also apologized for hitting several cars while rushing to the hospital: “That wrongdoing was justified.”

Two other people were wounded, including Jhoel López, a Dominican TV host who was with Ortiz. López apparently was wounded by the same bullet, National Police Director Ney Aldrin Bautista Almonte said. López was shot in the leg, and his injuries were not life-threatening, said his wife, Liza Blanco, who is also a TV host.

Police did not identify the third person or detail that person’s injuries.

Ortiz is one of the most beloved figures in sports history in the Dominican Republic and Boston. He led the Red Sox to three World Series championships, was a 10-time All-Star and hit 541 home runs.

Ortiz, who retired after the 2016 season and lives at least part of the year in the Dominican Republic, is often seen getting his cars washed and hanging out with friends, including other baseball players, artists and entertainers.

The Red Sox retired his number, 34, in 2017, and Boston renamed a bridge and a stretch of road outside Fenway Park in his honor. He maintains a home in Weston, on the outskirts of Boston.

Ortiz galvanized the city in the aftermath of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing that left three people dead, bellowing through a megaphone at Fenway Park: “This is our (expletive) city!”

"California man died in April at Dominican Republic resort after drink from hotel room minibar, family says","A fourth U.S. tourist died after he fell critically and suddenly ill at an all-inclusive resort in the Dominican Republic about a month before three others died in their rooms, Fox News has learned.

Robert Bell Wallace, 67, of California, became ill almost immediately after he had a scotch from the room minibar at the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino resort in Punta Cana, his niece, Chloe Arnold, told Fox News on Sunday. He was in the Dominican Republic to attend his stepson’s wedding.

Arnold said her uncle, an avid traveler, had been in relatively good health and just the month before had been skiing in Lake Tahoe.

Arnold said the family has been particularly concerned after having recently learned of the other seemingly mysterious deaths in the Dominican Republic. Miranda Schaup-Werner, a Pennsylvania woman, died almost four weeks later, on May 25, after she had a drink from her minibar at another hotel, the Bahia Principe La Romana.

U.S. TOURIST BEATEN DURING DOMINICAN VACATION ACCUSES RESORT OF VICTIM-BLAMING

""He was fine,"" Arnold said of her uncle, who owned a construction business and whose obituary page was filled with comments about his generosity and compassion. ""He and his wife arrived there at around midnight on April 10. On April 11 he had scotch from the minibar. He started feeling very sick, he had blood in his urine and stool right afterward.""

She said a hotel doctor had checked Wallace, then decided on April 13 that he needed to be hospitalized. He died April 14. Dominican authorities have yet to give the family a cause of death, Arnold said.

""We have so many questions,"" she said. ""We don't want this to happen to anyone else.""

The U.S. State Department, responding to questions about Wallace's death, said in a statement to Fox News: ""We can confirm the death of a U.S. citizen in April 2019 in the Dominican Republic. We offer our sincerest condolences to the family for their loss. Out of respect for the family during this difficult time, we do not have additional information to provide.""

PENNSYLVANIA WOMAN DIED AT SAME DOMINICAN RESORT COMPLEX FIVE DAYS BEFORE MARYLAND COUPLE IN SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES

In recent days, a Maryland widow went public with concerns about the death of her husband, David Harrison, last year at the same Hard Rock resort under similar, sudden circumstances. The two had gone there with their 12-year-old son to celebrate their wedding anniversary.

""My husband was a very fit, very healthy person when he passed away,"" she told Inside Edition. She said he'd had a physical shortly before the trip and, except for high blood pressure which he kept in check with medication, everything was fine.

""I started seeing all these other people that were dying of the same exact causes, which made me start to second guess. I no longer feel like my husband died of natural causes,' McCoy told local TV station WTOP. ""We went down there as a happy family, and we came home a broken family. I came home a widow and my 12-year-old son came home fatherless.""

Efforts to get a comment about the deaths of Harrison and Wallace from Hard Rock in Punta Cana were unsuccessful.

On May 30, an engaged couple from Maryland, Edward Holmes, 63, and Cynthia Day, 49, died in their room at the Bahia Principe La Romana. A hotel employee found them unresponsive in their room after they failed to check out.

Dominican authorities have said either preliminary or final autopsies indicated they all died of natural causes, and that they were isolated incidents, but the families said they had doubts. Some have hired lawyers and planned additional autopsies and tests in the United States.

U.S. officials have been restrained in their comments, only confirming deaths when asked. Neither the State Department, Bahia Principe, nor Dominican authorities have responded to repeated questions by Fox News about how many tourists from the U.S. and elsewhere have died in their rooms, or anywhere in resorts, in recent years.

Nearly half of the roughly 5 million tourists who visit the Dominican Republic each year are from the United States, statistics have shown.

While saying little publicly, however, teams of experts and inspectors from several international agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, conducted tests Thursday at the Bahia Principe properties where U.S. tourists died. It was unclear whether they inspected other resorts. The FBI confirmed to Fox News on Friday it was assisting Dominican authorities in investigating the deaths.

The testing and the FBI's involvement marked the first public indications that officials in the U.S. and the Dominican Republic have considered the possibility of something other than natural causes.

Dominican officials said Schaup, Holmes and Day had pulmonary edema, a condition in which the lungs fill with fluid. They said Schaup, 41, who collapsed after having the minibar drink at the Luxury Bahia Principe Bouganville -- which is adjacent to the sister hotel where Holmes and Day died -- died of a heart attack, though her family said she was healthy.

In recent days, the family of a Pennsylvania woman who was vacationing in the Dominican Republic last year said she died in her room at the Bahia Principe Resort in Punta Cana resort after she had a drink from the minibar. Relatives of Yvette Monique Sport, 51, told Fox 29 Philadelphia she was visiting the popular tourist spot last June, had a drink, later went to bed, and never woke up. Her death certificate said her official cause of death was a heart attack.

“It’s a complete fabrication,” Felecia Nieves, Sport's sister, said, “that you could have as many people and they all have the same cookie-cutter outcome. It’s impossible.”

Nieves said she planned to reach out to other families and press for answers.

Georgia man confirmed dead in Dominican Republic only the latest case in string of American fatalities there,"The State Department on Sunday confirmed another American fatality in the Dominican Republic, a tourist who died of ""respiratory illness"" in March -- and who is the 11th American to die in the Caribbean country this year.

Tracy Jerome Jester, Jr., a 31-year-old from Georgia, died after a day of sightseeing with his sister, his family said. It was not immediately clear what resort the Forsyth native stayed at during his trip.

""We can confirm the death of a U.S. citizen in the Dominican Republic in March 2019,"" a state department spokesperson told ABC News in a statement Sunday. ""We offer our sincerest condolences to the family for their loss. Out of respect for the family during this difficult time, we do not have additional information to provide.""

Jester's relatives say they still have unanswered questions about the 31-year-old's death.

""They had a good day. Saturday, they went out, they explored. They said they had a good day,"" Jester's mother, Melody Moore, told WSB-TV.

Moore said she talked to her son after the day trip and he seemed alright, but around 3:30 a.m. the next day, Jester's sister called Moore ""and she told me he was calling her saying he couldn’t breathe, just saying, 'Mama I can’t breathe, I can’t breathe.""

Jester's sister called emergency services but it was too late, Moore said. Jester reportedly suffered from Lupus, but it was unclear if that had any connection to his death.

""Being a mom, I want to go to where he was, where he died at last. Something is wrong, my son is gone. Something is really wrong,"" Moore said. ""As a mother, you're not there when your son takes his last breath. That hurts and I mean, you’ve got so many questions.""

In June, Francisco Javier Garcia, the country's tourism minister, castigated journalists for allegedly overblowing the string of deaths, and said the U.S. State Department's figures show there hasn't been an increase in American tourist deaths for reasons other than natural causes.

“The Dominican Republic has seen an exaggerated number of Americans in the Dominican Republic who have died,” Garcia said. “And media have taken it as an avalanche of deaths.”

But several relatives of deceased Americans have raised doubts about the accounts Dominican authorities have given them of their relatives' deaths, and many have also expressed exasperation with the U.S. State Department, which they say has played too passive a role in investigating.

The FBI has said they were testing alcohol from at least one mini-bar in at least one of the rooms at the Bahia Principe resort, where a number of guests died.

"Dominican Republic Has More Than 1.5 Million Single Moms, Report Says","More than 1.5 million women in the Dominican Republic – by choice, being widowed, divorce or some other reason – are single moms, according to a report.

More than 35 percent of the homes in the Caribbean nation are single-parent homes – and of those, 90 percent are women, according to a story in ElCaribe.com.do. Those women are poor, too, according to the story – a little over 20 percent of them survive on less than two dollars a day.

Doña Mireya, 75, says there's been a great difference in household dynamics, and it concerns her.

""When I moved here, there weren't too many single mothers,"" she said. ""But now, in nearly every house, you see young ladies, even girls, getting pregnant and then living with their parents.""

The last study to measure single mothers in the Dominican Republic was conducted in 2007. It found that 1.4 million women in the country were solely responsible for raising their children.

Dominican Republic leader in China after cutting Taiwan ties,"next Image 1 of 2

prev Image 2 of 2

China rolled out the red carpet Friday for the second time this week for a Latin American leader whose country recently switched its allegiance from Taipei to Beijing.

President Danilo Medina of the Dominican Republic met with Chinese President Xi Jinping after a formal welcome ceremony at the Great Hall of the People.

The summit came one day after a similar ceremony and meeting for Salvadoran President Salvador Sanchez Ceren.

Both El Salvador and the Dominican Republic broke their diplomatic ties with Taiwan earlier this year. They are among a number of countries that have established or resumed relations with China in recent years.

Beijing has been stepping up diplomatic and economic pressure on those that recognize Taiwan since Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen took office in 2016.

Beijing's aggressiveness is largely driven by Tsai's refusal to endorse the ""One-China"" principle, which maintains that Taiwan is part of China and that the Communist Party-ruled administration in Beijing is China's sole legitimate government.

""When Tsai Ing-wen took office, she adopted unfriendly policies toward the mainland,"" said Cui Shoujun, director of the Center for Latin American Studies at Renmin University in Beijing. ""Therefore, to some extent, the mainland believes that the time to set up ties with these countries is ripe. It is a kind of warning to Taiwan.""

Only 17 mainly small, developing countries still recognize Taiwan as a sovereign nation. Taiwan split from mainland China during a civil war in 1949. China considers the self-governing island to be part of its territory.

Cui said that establishing ties with China can bring economic benefits, noting that Xi has said Latin America is a natural extension of the maritime half of China's Belt and Road Initiative.",https://www.foxnews.com/world/dominican-republic-leader-in-china-after-cutting-taiwan-ties,N/A
Dominican Republic officials downplay spate of American tourist deaths in Caribbean nation,"After feeling besieged for the better part of the week by reporters covering the recent spate of American deaths in the Dominican Republic, the Caribbean island's officials appeared defiant Friday, using a news conference to downplay the deaths and castigate the media for turning the nine fatalities into ""an avalanche of death.""

Tourism Minister Francisco Javier Garcia accused journalists investigating the deaths of overblowing the numbers, and noted even the U.S. State Department 's figures show there hasn't been an increase in American tourist deaths for reasons other than natural causes.

TOXICOLOGIST SAYS A COLORLESS, ODORLESS 'INTOXICANT' COULD BE CAUSE OF DOMINICAN REPUBLIC DEATHS

“The Dominican Republic has seen an exaggerated number of Americans in the Dominican Republic who have died,” Garcia said. “And media have taken it as an avalanche of deaths.”

At least nine Americans have died suddenly in the Dominican Republican since June 2018, and family members have recently come forward to highlight at least two other similar deaths in September 2016 and April 2018. But the news coverage has worried government officials, who fear the country's successful tourism industry could take a hit if visitors start viewing the island as unsafe.

Garcia, who assured reporters officials have “nothing to hide,” also used the Friday news conference to boast about the country’s tourism industry.

“The Dominican Republic has a history of success with the tourism industry,"" he said ""We are the top travel destination in the Caribbean. It is the product of the work of the people in the Dominican Republic. The Dominican Republic is a safe country.”

He added, unequivocally: “In the Dominican Republic, there are no mysterious deaths.”

But several relatives of the deceased Americans have raised doubts about the accounts Dominican authorities have given them, and many have also expressed exasperation with the U.S. State Department, which they say has played too passive a role.

In June, a New Jersey woman, Leyla Cox, died in her room at the Excellence resort after falling critically and suddenly ill, according to her family. Cox, an MRI technician, had gone on a solo trip to celebrate her 53rd birthday. With the help of the U.S. Embassy in the Dominican Republic and his congressional representatives, her son, Will Cox, successfully got the authorities there to agree to send a vial of her blood to the U.S., where toxicology tests will soon be conducted at the New York hospital where she worked.

JUAN WILLIAMS: DOMINICAN REPUBLIC HASN'T 'BEEN TRANSPARENT OR CLEAR' AMID RESORT DEATHS

Cox's family and co-workers say they do not believe that she died of a heart attack, the official cause of death.

Several relatives of those who have died are also planning to conduct their own tests in the United States. Since Dominican authorities have attributed nearly all the deaths to natural causes, they have declined to conduct toxicological tests, leading to complaints from the relatives.

At least two members of Congress this week said they would press for answers.

The FBI revealed they are testing alcohol from at least one mini-bar in at least one of the rooms at the Bahia Principe resort, where a number of guests died, the New York Post reported.

The FBI announced their involvement last week, and are reportedly taking blood samples from the individuals who died under suspicious circumstances.

Garcia brushed off reports that there was bootleg alcohol being sold. He also criticized theories of poisonings because “if there was any ‘poisoning’ because of poor use of pesticides, then more people should have been affected.”

"Dominican Republic's economy most robust in Latin America, Caribbean region","The economy of the Dominican Republic grew 7 percent last year and established itself as the most robust in the Latin American and Caribbean region, officials said Wednesday.

Central Bank Governor Héctor Valdez credited in part the drop in international oil prices and the strengthening of the U.S. economy for the economic growth, which he said helped generate more tourism and remittances for the Dominican Republic.

The GDP grew 7 percent for the second consecutive year, according to central bank figures, with help from strong performances in construction, tourism and banking, he said.

""The results have been extremely satisfying. I would say better than expected,"" Valdez said, adding that the growth comes as other countries in the region struggle with sluggish economies.

The Dominican Republic's foreign exchange earnings from tourism, remittances, foreign investment and exports of goods and services exceeded $23 billion, or 35 percent of the total GDP, Valdez said. Inflation remained at 2.3 percent, below the 4 percent target set by the government. However, Valdez noted that despite the positive economic performance, a large part of the population still does not earn enough to buy basic food staples.

Statistics released by the World Bank showed that while Panama's economy also remains strong, with its GDP growing 6 percent last year, Latin America overall saw a nearly 1 percent drop in its GDP. The bank predicts the region as a whole will see zero economic growth this year, but says there is potential for 2.2 percent growth in 2017-18.

Dominican Republic resort deaths mystery: timeline,"The Dominican Republic, long one of the top Caribbean destinations for U.S. travelers, is in the spotlight for reasons no country heavily dependent on tourism ever wants to be associated with — a rash of deaths of seemingly healthy people who succumbed under oddly similar circumstances.

So far, we know of at nine Americans who have died over 2018 and 2019 — with word of their deaths coming not from U.S. or Dominican officials, but in dribs and drabs from relatives or friends who come forward, driven by concerns that the official cause may not be credible or tell the whole the story.

June 2018

Yvette Monique Sport, 51, checked into the Bahia Principe resort in Punta Cana with her fiancé, Howard Taltoan, and some friends. Sport had a drink from the room mini bar. Sport, of Pennsylvania, took a shower and went to bed, her sister Felecia Nieves tells local reporters.

The next morning, Taltoan tried to wake Sport, but she is unresponsive.

“He tried to nudge her again and there was no sound and then she was gone,” Nieves said.

Her death certificate listed the cause as a heart attack, she says.

COLORADO COUPLE FILES SUIT ALLEGING CHEMICALS AT DOMINICAN REPUBLIC RESORT MADE THEM CRITICALLY ILL

July 2018

David Harrison, 45, of Maryland, checked into the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Punta Cana. He and his wife, Dawn McCoy, are there with their 12-year-old son to celebrate their wedding anniversary.

After several days, on July 12, Harrison started to feel ill, McCoy tells Fox & Friends. The next day, after lying in bed, still not feeling well, he decided to join his wife and friends in the hotel casino. McCoy noticed there was a “strange smell…a very potent smell” coming from her husband. In the casino, he began feeling ill again and told McCoy he wanted to return to the room. She wanted to call for an ambulance, but was told by hotel staff that the resort doctor must check Harrison first. McCoy said it took a long time for the doctor to arrive, and her husband died.

The official cause of death was pulmonary edema and heart attack.

""My husband was a very fit, very healthy person when he passed away,"" she told Inside Edition.

""I started seeing all these other people that were dying of the same exact causes, which made me start to second guess. I no longer feel like my husband died of natural causes,' McCoy told local TV station WTOP. ""We went down there as a happy family, and we came home a broken family. I came home a widow and my 12-year-old son came home fatherless.""

January 2019

Jerry Curran, 78, and his wife traveled to the Dominican Republic with another couple in late January and stayed at Dreams Resort in Punta Cana. Within three days, he died, his daughter told WKYC.

“He went to the Dominican Republic healthy and he just never came back,” daughter Kellie Brown said. ""I thought something's not right. My father was a healthy 78-year-old, he took care of himself and I just didn't think anything like this was possible, but then I started to hear other people's stories.""

Curran died from four things, per his death certificate: Cerebral hypoxia, pulmonary edema, subdural hematoma and severe encephalitic cranial trauma, meaning a traumatic brain injury.

In nearly all of the Americans reported dead in the Dominican Republic, officials said there were signs of pulmonary edema — a condition in which the lungs fill with fluid. Those tourists ranged in age from 41 to 67.

April 2019

Robert Bell Wallace, a 67-year-old businessman from California, headed to the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in Punta Cana with his wife, Beverly, for the wedding of his stepson.

He drank Scotch from the minibar in his room. The drink did not come from the kind of miniature bottles found in such minibars and served on airplanes, but from a dispenser, his family tells Fox News.

He became critically ill and is taken to the hospital, where he is kept for a couple of days. He died on the day of his stepson’s wedding. Authorities said the cause was a heart attack.

May 25, 2019

Miranda Schaup-Werner, a 41-year-old psychotherapist from Pennylvania, and her husband, Dan, checked into the Luxury Bahia Principe Bouganville in La Romana, one of the Dominican Republic’s largest cities. They were there to celebrate their ninth wedding anniversary.

In the evening, she had an alcoholic beverage from the minibar, the family spokesman, Jay McDonald, who is Dan Werner’s brother-in-law, told Fox News. Schaup, who had been fine until that point, started to get up from a chair and shrieked, calling out for her husband, who was in another part of the room. She collapsed and was declared dead when the medical help arrived.

Hotel employees spoke to Dan Werner, asking him questions, including some about Schaup’s health. He mentioned a heart condition that was diagnosed about 15 years earlier, but that was not ongoing or considered serious.

Her death certificate mentioned pulmonary edema and cardiac abnormalities. The cause of death was ruled a heart attack.

May 30, 2019

On May 25, Edward Holmes, 63 and his fiancé, Cynthia Day, 49, checked into the Grand Bahia Principe La Romana, which is nearly adjacent to the Bahia Principe hotel where Schaup-Werner stayed.

At some point either on Wednesday, May 29, or early Thursday, May 30, Holmes contacted hotel staff, saying he was feeling unwell. When they offered to give him medical treatment, he declined. Some published reports said it was because of the cost. Holmes and Day were scheduled to fly back to Maryland on May 30, but they did not check out. A hotel employee went to their room, where both are found dead.

A preliminary autopsy listed pulmonary edema, and internal bleeding, including in their pancreases. Holmes was listed as having an enlarged heart and cirrhosis of the liver.

Hotel officials and Dominican authorities stressed that medication for blood pressure, and other conditions, are found in their room, though they provide no context.

Unaware of the other deaths, relatives of the couple went public, and told reporters that they found the sudden passing of both Holmes and Day suspicious.

Their bodies were returned to the U.S. on July 11. The family attorney, Steven Bullock, said to reporters that the family plans to have autopsies conducted before Holmes and Day are buried.

The Dominican tourism minister, Javier Garcia, said the deaths are isolated incidents, and that the public must keep in mind that the island had been host to more than 30 million tourists in the last five years.

“These are situations that can occur in any country, in any hotel in the world,” he said. “It’s regrettable but sometimes it happens.”

June 11, 2019

Leyla Cox, 53, of New Brighton, New York, went on vacation June 5 and was expected to return a week later.

Cox, who traveled alone, was found dead of a heart attack in her hotel room on June 11.

Her son Will Cox, 25, told Fox News that Dominican authorities were resisting doing toxicology tests and pressuring him to have her body cremated or embalmed before its return to the U.S.

June 12, 2019

On Wednesday, Dominican tourism officials sought to reassure U.S. tourists in a lengthy statement stressing that U.S. federal agents and health specialists are taking an active role investigating the deaths.

The Tourism Ministry said it wanted to “extend its sincerest condolences to the families and friends of those affected in the tragic events that have been reported over the last few weeks in the country.”

The Dominican tourism officials noted that U.S. agencies were working closely with Dominican investigators, citing U.S. Embassy comments about both countries “actively working in collaboration…to ensure that all U.S. citizens are and feel safe within the country.""

The FBI is conducting deeper analyses of toxicological results, the statement said, warning that conclusions may take up to a month and urging “patience during this process.”

"Elnaz Rekabi, who competed without hijab, hauled back to Islamic Republic for arrest: report","A female Iranian climber who competed in a South Korean championship without a hijab has reportedly gone missing and is expected to be placed under arrest upon her return to the Islamic Republic.

Elnaz Rekabi, who went viral for competing without the Islamic headscarf at the International Federation of Sport Climbing's Asian Championships in Seoul on Sunday, has not been heard from.

Her friends told the BBC's Persian service, which has extensive contacts within Iran despite being banned from operating there, that they had been unable to contact Rekabi. The outlet quoted an unnamed ""informed source"" who said Iranian officials seized both Rekabi's phone and passport.

BBC Persian also reported that Rekabi was to be arrested upon her return to the Islamic Republic.

IRAN ANTI-RIOT POLICE SEXUALLY ASSAULT WOMEN IN PUBLIC AS PROTESTS NEAR ONE-MONTH ANNIVERSARY

A later Instagram post on an account attributed to Rekabi said not wearing a hijab was ""unintentional,"" though it wasn't immediately clear whether she wrote the post or what condition she was in at the time.

The Iranian government routinely pressures activists at home and abroad, often airing what rights group describe as coerced confessions on state television, according to the Associated Press.

Rekabi, 33, didn’t put on a hijab during Sunday’s final at the International Federation of Sport Climbing’s Asia Championship, according to the Seoul-based Korea Alpine Federation, the organizers of the event. Federation officials said Rekabi wore a hijab during her initial appearances at the one-week climbing event.

She wore just a black headband when competing Sunday, her dark hair pulled back in a ponytail; she had a white jersey with Iran's flag as a logo on it. The video of Rekabi competing without the headscarf went viral as protests sparked by the September in-custody death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman detained by the country’s morality police for wearing the hijab too loosely, have entered a fifth week in more than 100 Iranian cities.

Rekabi left Seoul on a Tuesday morning flight, the Iranian Embassy in South Korea said. Her departure was initially scheduled for Wednesday, but the flight was moved up.

In a tweet, the Iranian Embassy in Seoul denied ""all the fake, false news and disinformation"" regarding Rekabi’s departure. But instead of posting a photo of her from the Seoul competition, it posted an image of her wearing a headscarf at a previous competition in Moscow, where she took a bronze medal.

IranWire, another website focusing on the country founded by Iranian-Canadian journalist Maziar Bahari who once was detained by Iran, reported that Rekabi was somehow tricked by Reza Zarei, the head of Iran's Climbing Federation, to enter the Iranian embassy in Seoul and hand over her passport and phone in exchange for her guaranteed safe return to Iran.

According to the outlet, Zarei was instructed to do so by Mohammad Khosravivafa, Iran's Olympic Committee chairman. Khosravivafa had been ordered by Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) to move Rekabi into the embassy. The quick flight was reportedly to avoid protesters gathering outside the embassy in South Korea.

IranWire reported that once Rekabi arrived at Imam Khomeini international airport, she was to be immediately transferred to Tehran’s Evin Prison. The prison was the site of a massive fire that killed at least eight prisoners.

Rekabi reportedly made the decision to compete without the hijab about a month ago but did not opt to seek asylum in South Korea because her husband is back in Iran and she, therefore, wanted to be able to return to her home country after the competition.

Haitian-descended residents of Dominican Republic stripped of citizenship by high court,"Thousands of Dominican Republic residents have been thrown into limbo by a ruling from the country's highest court that strips citizenship from anyone born to migrants who entered illegally. The decree affects mainly people of Haitian descent and is likely to worsen already acrimonious relations with neighboring Haiti.

Advocacy groups for immigrants expressed anger over Thursday's ruling, saying it ignored the rights of those affected and was based on bigotry against predominantly black Haitians.

""This is outrageous,"" said Ana Maria Belique, spokeswoman for a nonprofit group that has fought for the rights of children born in the Dominican Republic to migrants, such as herself. ""It's an injustice based on prejudice and xenophobia.""

The Constitutional Court's decision cannot be appealed, and it covers those born since 1929 — a category that overwhelmingly includes Haitians brought in to work on farms and their descendants.

David Abraham, a law professor at the University of Miami, said the decision was part of a larger effort to keep Haitians from entering the Dominican Republic and to encourage self-deportation of those already here.

He cited the racial differences between the predominantly black Haitians and mixed-race Dominicans as well as Haiti's plight as one of the world's poorest countries.

""The fear of the Dominican Republic, of being pulled down to the level of Haiti economically and the 'blackening' of the country, has been an obsession of Dominican politicians for well over a century,"" he said.

Spanish-speaking Dominicans and Creole-speaking Haitians share the Caribbean island of Hispaniola and have a long history of troubles, including wars and massacres. Relations warmed after Haiti's devastating 2010 earthquake that killed an estimated 300,000 people, but tensions have since resumed.

The office of Haitian Prime Minister Laurent Lamothe declined to comment about the ruling.

Edwin Paraison, a former Haitian Cabinet minister who has been working to improve relations between the two nations, criticized the court and warned that the ruling could hurt Dominicans. ""The sentence expresses a rejection of the Haitian diaspora while setting a dangerous precedent that can be reproduced, if appropriate action isn't taken, against other immigrant communities, including Dominicans, in several countries worldwide,"" he said in an email.

The Constitutional Court said officials are studying birth certificates of more than 16,000 people and noted that electoral authorities have refused to issue identity documents to 40,000 people of Haitian descent. It gave the electoral commission a year to produce a list of people to be excluded from citizenship.

The Economy Ministry recently calculated that about 500,000 people born in Haiti now live in the Dominican Republic, but it gave no estimate for the number of people of Haitian descent living in the country. The Dominican Republic's total population is a little over 10 million.

The debate over citizenship began to escalate in 2007, when electoral authorities refused to issue identity documents or return copies of them to Dominican-born people of Haitian descent. In 2008, several people challenged those decisions in court, including Belique, whose birth certificate was seized by government officials when she tried to enroll in a local university.

Until 2010, the Dominican Republic followed the principle of automatically bestowing citizenship to anyone born on its soil. But that year, the government approved a new constitution stating that citizenship will be granted only to those born on its soil to at least one parent of Dominican blood or whose foreign parents are legal residents.

Citing that constitution, the court ruled that all Haitian migrants who came to work in Dominican sugarcane fields after 1929 were ""in transit,"" and thus their children were not automatically entitled to citizenship just because they were born here.

Dominican lawyer Cristobal Rodriguez said the court disregarded the principle of law retroactivity by applying the criteria of a new constitution approved in 2010 to people born decades earlier.

Rights groups and migrant activists said the decision would force many people underground and deprive them of basic needs and public services.

Activists said they would likely seek help from the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, which in turn might submit the case to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights.

Jorge Duany, an anthropology professor at Florida International University who has studied the migration of Dominicans in the Caribbean, said the decision comes after countless years of friction between the two countries.

""The impact could be truly catastrophic,"" he said. ""They are stigmatizing an entire Haitian population.""

"Hard Rock's Dominican Republic resort, where two US tourists died, pulls minibar dispensers from all rooms","The Hard Rock resort in the Dominican Republic, where two U.S. tourists died in the past year, says it is removing minibar dispensers from all its guest rooms.

The resort said in a statement that it is also contracting with a U.S. health care facility to ensure that the clinic at the resort “is complying with all international and U.S. standards of care.”

The move comes on the heels of the news that celebrity Steve Harvey has dropped plans to hold his third annual Sand and Soul Festival at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, which is in Punta Cana. The event, planned for October, is being canceled because of concerns about tourist safety in the Dominican Republic, where at least 11 U.S. tourists are known to have died in the past year after suddenly falling critically ill at all-inclusive resorts. Another U.S. tourist died in a luxury resort on the popular Caribbean vacation spot in 2016.

CALIFORNIA MAN DIED IN APRIL AT HARD ROCK RESORT IN DOMINICAN REPUBLIC AFTER DRINK FROM MINIBAR, FAMILY SAYS

Dominican authorities have insisted from the time the first deaths were reported in May – when news broke that a Maryland couple were found dead in their room -- that they were triggered by natural causes. But because the families of the tourists have raised doubts, saying that their loved ones had been generally healthy and showed no signs of illness prior to suddenly getting sick and dying in the Dominican Republic, Dominican authorities and the FBI are conducting tests of the minibars.

“Today, June 21, 2019, the Ministry of Public Health in the Dominican Republic has released further information on the American tourists who passed away in 2019, including autopsy findings that reveal these deaths were unrelated and from natural causes and pre-existing conditions,” the resort statement said. “We are deeply saddened by these unfortunate incidents, and extend our sincerest sympathy to the families of those affected. We will continue to respect the privacy of our guests and their families.”

“The safety and health of our guests is now, and has always been, our highest priority,” the statement continued. “Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Punta Cana follows internationally recognized regulations regarding guest health, sanitation and security.”

DOMINICAN TOURISM OFFICIAL VOWS 'DISCIPLINARY ACTION' IF U.S. TOURIST DEATH PROBE FINDS NEGLIGENCE

Questions have arisen about whether the tourists who died after consuming a beverage actually drank bootleg or counterfeit alcohol, where sometimes a legitimate brand of alcohol, or water, is mixed with a lesser grade and sometimes deadly substance such as methanol and other indigestible alcohol compounds and chemicals. Safeproof.org says that methanol, ""a common additive to solvents, antifreeze and other industrial products is deadly for human consumption.""

The Hard Rock statement said the resort implements ""rigorous food and beverage protocols, including purchasing products from U.S. licensed and reputable vendors, as well as daily inspections of all products served throughout the hotel.”

""Additionally, our team members are trained to inspect all supplies, equipment and products that enter the property,"" it continued. ""The property employs more than 70 security personnel per shift and has hundreds of cameras on property to provide the utmost safety for guests and team members.""

Two of the known 12 U.S. tourists who died fell suddenly ill while at the Hard Rock resort.

Robert Bell Wallace, 67, of California, became ill almost immediately after he had a scotch from the room minibar at the Hard Rock resort, his niece, Chloe Arnold, told Fox News. Wallace, who died on April 14, was in the Dominican Republic to attend his stepson’s wedding.

Arnold said her uncle, an avid traveler, had been in relatively good health and just the month before had been skiing in Lake Tahoe.

""He was fine,"" Arnold said of her uncle, who owned a construction business and whose obituary page was filled with comments about his generosity and compassion. ""He and his wife arrived there at around midnight on April 10. On April 11 he had scotch from the minibar. He started feeling very sick, he had blood in his urine and stool right afterward.""

In July 2018, David Harrison, 45, became severely ill in his room at the Hard Rock resort and died at a hospital.

His widow, Dawn McCoy, said that it took nearly a half hour for a doctor to show up at the resort room, where her husband's condition had been deteriorating quickly. A funeral director came over to her at the hospital to tell her that Harrison was dead. Like many relatives of the other U.S. tourists, McCoy said she was repeatedly pressured to cremate her husband's body.

On Saturday, McCoy said on ""Fox & Friends"" that she does not trust what Dominican authorities told her about her husband's death.

The Hard Rock statement noted ""All of the alcohol on property will continue to be brand name and sourced from the U.S., with the exception of a Dominican Republic specialty, Mama Juana, and local beer, Presidente, that we carry to support our community.""



The resort also noted that while it has been inspected by the Ministry of Public Health, it nonetheless has contracted a U.S. third-party testing lab ""to provide inspections and laboratory testing of all food and beverage products and public spaces.""

The Nickelodeon Hotel & Resort in Punta Cana, which has not had any reported U.S. tourist death, meanwhile, is purportedly scrambling to find out what made former ""Bachelorette"" star Melissa Rycroft severely ill during her stay at the resort recently.

Page Six quoted a representative of Rycroft as saying she was still very ill, battling ""major stomach issues"" even after being back in the United States.

TMZ, the celebrity gossip site, reported that its sources say ""the Nickelodeon Resort is freaking out and lots of people are canceling their reservations, though it's unclear if news of Melissa's mysterious illness is the reason for the cancellations, or simply the general hysteria involving tourist deaths on the island.""",https://www.foxnews.com/world/hard-rock-resort-where-two-u-s-tourists-died-pulls-minibars-from-all-rooms,N/A
Hip hop in Central African Republic brings hope in crisis,"Lionel Fotot once watched a crowd kill a 6-year-old Muslim boy with a machete. He can't shake the memories of the brutalities he witnessed as Central African Republic collapsed into sectarian violence.

So the young hip hop artist was heartened when his One Force group, comprised of Christians and Muslims, performed to a packed crowd at the largest venue in the capital, the 20,000-seat Barthelemy Boganda Stadium.

""Our music is like a medicine that can heal the country,"" Fotot said. ""Before they disarm their weapons, the youth have to disarm their hearts.""

Central African Republic has faced interreligious and intercommunal fighting since 2013, when predominantly Muslim Seleka rebels seized power in the capital, Bangui. Anti-balaka militias, mostly Christians, fought back, resulting in thousands of people killed and hundreds of thousands displaced.

The situation has worsened in recent months, with more than 300 people killed and 100,000 people displaced since mid-May after attacks in the impoverished country's southeast and center.

Music is one approach in trying to pull the nation together again.

Twenty young rappers from Central African Republic recently attended a jam session and cultural exchange with visiting Congolese-American rapper and academic Omekongo Dibinga. Organized by the U.S. Embassy and U.N. peacekeeping forces in the country, the event was meant to ""try to inspire them and to give them hope,"" said U.N. spokesman Herve Verhoosel.

""Sometimes people here lack confidence in themselves and their future, because all that they have known since they were born has been conflict, people dying,"" Verhoosel said.

One of the young rappers at the event was Marlon Bisseni, who practices every day at home or with members of his rap group Enigmatique. The 21-year-old also studies human resources at a local university, knowing he needs a way to survive in a country where most people make less than a dollar a day.

""I love hip hop. Without music, I am nothing,"" said Bisseni, also known as ""Rym Thug.""

The country's growing community of hip hop artists looks toward a brighter future.

""We say, 'No. Stop. We don't need war,'"" said 23-year-old artist Felix Ngobo. ""We say, 'It doesn't matter if you're Christian or Muslim.' We are all the same.""

Ngobo performs as ""Felika Joker"" in his LK City group, with songs entitled ""We need peace"" and ""Reconciliation Street.""

Dibinga, the visiting rapper and academic at American University, advised the young rappers in Bangui to stay true to their voice and draw on their own experiences instead of emulating U.S. artists.

""Art is community,"" Dibinga said. ""Whether you're Muslim or Christian, whether you're whatever ... you have more things in common than things that are different. That's how we start to build. And when people are picking up the microphone, they're not picking up the guns.""",https://www.foxnews.com/world/hip-hop-in-central-african-republic-brings-hope-in-crisis,N/A
Hurricane Fiona makes landfall in Dominican Republic after hitting Puerto Rico,"Hurricane Fiona made landfall in the Dominican Republic on Monday after unleashing havoc in Puerto Rico, where the power grid was knocked out and residents suffered floods and landslides.

Maximum sustained winds at landfall in the Dominican Republic are estimated to be 90 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center.

Significant flooding caused by the hurricane is being blamed for at least one death on the French Caribbean island of Guadeloupe, a local official said . No deaths have been reported in Puerto Rico, but authorities say it is too soon to weigh the damage from the storm that is expected to unleash torrential rain across the region on Monday.

The U.S. territory is forecasted to receive up to 30 inches in its eastern and southern regions.

PUERTO RICO IN BLACKOUT AFTER HURRICANE FIONA STRIKES, RESIDENTS COULD BE WITHOUT POWER FOR ‘SEVERAL DAYS’

Ernesto Morales, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in San Juan, said it is ""important people understand that this is not over.""

Morales explained that flooding has reached ""historic levels"" and authorities are evacuating or rescuing hundreds of people across the region.

""The damages that we are seeing are catastrophic,"" Gov. Pedro Pierluisi said.

Brown water flowed through streets and into homes and even consumed a southern Puerto Rico runway airport.

The hurricane tore up asphalt from roads and washed away a bridge in the town of Utuado, which police said was added by the National Guard after Hurricane Maria hit in 2017.

Hurricane Fiona also ripped off the roofs of several homes on the island.

The storm was centered 50 miles southeast of Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, and had maximum sustained winds of 85 mph Sunday night, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center. Fiona was moving northwest at 9 mph.

PUERTO RICO BRACES FOR FIONA AS STORM ESCALATES INTO HURRICANE BEFORE LANDFALL

Authorities are continuing to assess the damage endured from Fiona, and many residents are unsure when power may be restored.

The company Luma, which operates power transmission and distribution, said bad weather, including 80 mph winds, had disrupted transmission lines on Sunday.

Health centers were running on generators, some of which had failed. Health Secretary Carlos Mellado said crews rushed to repair generators at the Comprehensive Cancer Center.

More than 3,000 homes still have a blue tarp in place of a roof. Infrastructure, including the power grid, remains weak. Reconstruction only recently began and outages remain frequent.

More than 1,000 people with around 80 pets across the island were in need of shelter by Sunday night.

U.S. President Joe Biden declared a state of emergency in Puerto Rico as the eye of the storm approached the island’s southwest corner.

Fiona was forecast to strike northern Haiti and the Turks and Caicos Islands on Monday after making landfall in the Dominican Republic.

"In blow to Taiwan, Dominican Republic forges ties with China","next Image 1 of 2

prev Image 2 of 2

The Dominican Republic established diplomatic relations with China on Tuesday, breaking ties with Beijing's rival Taiwan in the latest blow to the self-ruled island democracy China has been trying to isolate on the global stage. Taiwan said it was ""deeply upset"" by the move.

Officials from China and the Dominican government signed a joint communique at an event in Beijing announcing the establishment of ties. The Dominican Republic ""breaks diplomatic relations with Taiwan, which is an inalienable part of China, and will not maintain any kind of official relations or contacts,"" said foreign minister Miguel Vargas, who sat alongside Chinese State Councilor Wang Yi.

The decision was the latest setback for Taiwan in the Caribbean and Latin America. Panama dropped its longtime ties with Taiwan last year and established relations with China, which considers Taiwan to be Chinese territory. The island is recognized as a sovereign nation by only 19 mainly small, developing countries.

Taiwan criticized what it called China's ""dollar diplomacy"" and announced it would terminate ties with the Dominican Republic immediately, including all projects and assistance it provides to the Caribbean nation.

""This is an unfriendly and destructive approach to cross-strait relations,"" Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen told reporters at an event in Taipei, referring to China's action. ""These actions will make the people in Taiwan feel disappointed and increase the variables in cross-strait relations.""

The announcement came just a day after Tsai had met with the foreign minister of Haiti, one of Taiwan's allies, in Taipei.

Beijing has been seeking to increase pressure on Tsai, whose independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party says it wants stable relations with China, but refuses to endorse the ""one China"" principle.

Some analysts say Chinese President Xi Jinping, one of the most powerful Chinese leaders in decades, seems determined to bring Taiwan under Beijing's control during his time in office, something that would place him in the history books alongside Mao Zedong.

The island's 23 million residents are strongly in favor of maintaining their de facto independent status, but Xi has previously warned a Taiwanese envoy that the issue of unification cannot be put off indefinitely.

Wang, China's foreign minister, hailed ""a new page in the history of bilateral ties"" between Beijing and the Dominican Republic. ""From now on, China has one more good friend in Latin America with whom we could help each other,"" Wang said.

Taiwan's Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said Beijing had offered ""vast financial incentives"" to the Dominican Republic to get it to end 77 years of diplomatic relations with Taiwan. Wu warned that Beijing has failed to deliver on hundreds of millions of dollars in pledges to some of Taiwan's former diplomatic allies. He said the Taiwanese government was ""deeply upset by China's actions.""

Taiwan ""strongly condemns China's objectionable decision to use dollar diplomacy to convert Taiwan's allies,"" Wu said.

""While Taiwan faces serious diplomatic challenges, the government will not bow down to pressure from Beijing,"" Wu said.

Flavio Dario Espinal, legal consultant to the Dominican presidential office, said at a news conference Monday in Santo Domingo that the change in foreign policy was based on the ""needs, potential and future prospects"" of his Caribbean nation.

""History and socioeconomics reality now force us to change course,"" he said.

Espinal said that even without formal diplomatic relations with China, trade between the two countries ""has grown year after year to the point that today China is the second biggest supplier of our imports.""

After Panama cut its ties with Taiwan, then-Taiwanese Foreign Minister David Tawei Lee visited the Dominican Republic last July as part of a campaign to shore up its relations and propose new cooperation projects. During his stay in Santo Domingo, Lee also met with Taiwan's ambassadors in Latin America to discuss strategies for not losing more allies.

The Dominican Republic has received millions of dollars in donations for development programs from Taiwan, but the government also started commercial and political contacts with China beginning in the middle of the past decade.

According to the Dominican government, bilateral trade with China has reached $2 billion a year, making the Dominican Republic the second-largest trading partner for China among the Caribbean and Central American nations.

Espinal said the government informed Taiwan of its move earlier Monday and thanked the Taiwanese for ""the cooperation that we have shared for years."" He said that had allowed ""the development of very important programs"" for the Dominican Republic.

Taiwan split from mainland China amid civil war in 1949, and Beijing campaigns relentlessly to isolate the island globally. It cut off relations with Tsai's government shortly after she took office in 2016 and has been steadily ratcheting up both diplomatic and economic pressure. Chinese analysts say Beijing will likely continue to use its economic and political clout to lure away other Taiwanese allies until Tsai accedes to China's demands.

Tsai said Beijing's actions against Taiwan — including ramped up military drills around the island — have increased tensions.

Beijing's actions have ""unilaterally undermined the peaceful status quo across the strait and are not what a responsible member of the international community should be doing,"" a statement from her office said. ""Such mistakes should be stopped immediately.""

Beijing insists that only it has the right to represent China in international society. The island is excluded from the United Nations and other multinational bodies that require official governmental recognition at China's insistence.

'In turmoil again': Central African Republic unrest spreads,"No soldiers or police patrol this remote town in the far southeast of Central African Republic, where armed groups have attacked several times in the past few months. A company of U.N. peacekeepers here ventures no more than three miles (4 kilometers) from their base.

Local authorities' requests for more help to secure the area have gone unanswered as Central African Republic's deadly sectarian violence moves closer to the region along raw dirt roads. The town of 10,000 people feels increasingly unsafe, community leader Pierre Yakanza said.

The violence has killed hundreds in the past month and is spreading through parts of the country far from the capital, Bangui. The U.N. peacekeeping force of 12,000 troops is not enough to protect civilians.

""With just the U.N., it's not enough. It can't secure the people 100 percent,"" Yakanza said. ""We don't know what's coming."" Some people have fled to Congo, a few kilometers' walk away.

The U.N. peacekeeping force commander in Central African Republic, Lt. Gen. Balla Keita, told The Associated Press he is constantly moving forces around the impoverished country to stop the resurgent violence.

""The whole country is in turmoil again,"" said Keita, who commands the multinational force, known as MINUSCA, and wants additional troops to protect civilians. ""If we want to be successful, really we need some additional capacity.""

Central African Republic has been unstable since its longtime president was ousted by northern rebels in March 2013. By the end of that year, sectarian violence had exploded and eventually forced most of the capital's Muslims to flee to neighboring countries.

The southeast was mainly spared bloodshed, but all that has changed this year.

Since May 8, fighting in the southeastern city of Bangassou, the southern town of Alindao and the central mining town of Bria has left more than 150 people dead and displaced more than 25,000, according to the U.N.

The U.N. troops are ""stretched too thin to respond to all of the hotspots right now, including in the southeast,"" said Evan Cinq-Mars, ?the U.N. advocate and policy adviser at the non-profit Center for Civilians in Conflict.

""There needs to be a serious discussion about how to reinforce the U.N. mission given the precarious dynamics gripping CAR right now.""

While there are hopes that the Central African Republic army, or FACA, can secure the area, that's unlikely anytime soon. It's estimated to have about 7,500 troops and is poorly armed and trained.

In Bangui, European Union soldiers are training thousands of new Central African Republic army troops that could be deployed to the countryside.

""We are trying to make an army and an army takes years in order to form,"" said Brig. Gen. Herman Ruys, commander for the EU training mission.

The recent increase in violence comes as the U.S. military ends its hunt for Lord's Resistance Army leader Joseph Kony. The Ugandan-based rebel group has been active in Central African Republic, and many fear civilians are now even more vulnerable.

The U.N. has anticipated this security vacuum since June 2016 and knew it would be unable to fill the void, according to an internal memo obtained by the AP. In the memo, U.N. officials said the withdrawal by the U.S. and Ugandan militaries would potentially lead to increases in civilian attacks and ""fresh abduction campaigns"" by the rebel group.

""The withdrawal of Ugandan and U.S. troops in the region has placed an even greater burden on MINUSCA to protect civilians from attacks, a task they have struggled greatly to live up to so far,"" said Paul Ronan with the non-profit Invisible Children.

Last week, a group of Lord's Resistance Army fighters attacked the village of Banangui, about 35 miles from Zemio. Wearing military uniforms and armed with AK-47s, they wounded two civilians and kidnapped 16 people, according to a non-profit group monitoring the security situation.

""The problem is that the LRA are always on the roads,"" said Moïse Ouele, 33, who lives in a village near Zemio. ""They stop the people on the road and take all their things. They also kill them.""",https://www.foxnews.com/world/in-turmoil-again-central-african-republic-unrest-spreads,N/A

Moldova prepared to defend itself after map shows former Soviet republic as possible next Russian target,"The Moldovan ambassador to the U.S. said Wednesday his country is prepared to defend its borders if Russia or Belarus were to invade the former Soviet republic.

""The country is prepared [for] any kind of scenarios, including the very worst-case scenario,"" Ambassador Eugen Caras told Fox News in an exclusive interview. ""So we will be defending what's to be defended.""

A day earlier, video surfaced showing Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko standing in front of a map that appeared to indicate the Moldovan breakaway state of Transnistria as a potential next target.

Lukashenko is Russian President Vladimir Putin’s closest ally in the region. Belarus was instrumental in the lead-up to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

‘Mistake’ on the map?

Caras said the Belarusians told Moldovan officials that the placement of Moldova on the map was a ""mistake.""

A deputy-level foreign minister summoned the Belarusian ambassador to Moldova to the Foreign Ministry and was asked for clarity, according to Caras.

""From what I understand, the ambassador said that there was a mistake on behalf of the Ministry of Defense of Belarus,"" Caras told Fox News.

UKRAINE STANDS UP TO RUSSIAN CYBERATTACKS; PUTIN COULD LAUNCH REVENGE ATTACKS AGAINST US, EXPERT WARNS

Caras said Moldova is not in a state of panic, though the country is worried about a potential threat.

""We are very concerned with this situation. We condemn this,"" Caras, who assumed his post in 2020, told Fox News. ""One cannot be sure 100% of the next phase. Will we be targeted or not? As of today, it seems that we are not a target.""

""But what happens in a week's time? I cannot predict,"" Caras continued. ""We are very vigilant. We are very concerned.""

Caras said the Moldovan defense forces were ""prepared"" and that there was not an ""imminent threat"" of invasion.

Belarus joined Russia, Eritrea, North Korea and Syria in opposing a United Nations resolution on Wednesday condemning the Russian invasion.

NATO membership?

Moldova, which has a neutrality provision written into its constitution, hasn’t sought NATO membership, but Caras told Fox News the war in Ukraine could change that.

""I wouldn't rule out that this could shape the perception in the people's mind of the security situation or the security needs and the requirements in the future,"" Caras said.

He said Moldova has been accepting Ukrainian refugees since Russia invaded a week ago.

""We have new and new refugees crossing into Moldova,"" he told Fox News. ""The latest figures are around 114,000 people crossing into Moldova since the war broke out.""

Puerto Ricans flee to Dominican Republic to escape U.S. territory's economic crisis,"Carlos Gonzalez already had noticed the growing number of empty chairs and increasingly quiet slot machines at the Puerto Rico casino where he worked as he mulled a job offer in the Dominican Republic.

It was 2013, and Puerto Rico's economy had been in a downward slide for nearly a decade. Gonzalez didn't know it at the time, but the once-popular casino where he worked as a marketing manager would soon close.

He thought of his family and friends and the reasons he moved back to Puerto Rico in the first place after spending more than 20 years in New Jersey. It took him several months to make a decision — ""It's not easy to leave your land,"" the Puerto Rico native said — but he finally did.

""I never imagined it. Never!"" Gonzalez said with a laugh. ""I even asked myself 2,000 times whether I really was moving to the Dominican Republic. I told myself it was crazy.""

The flow of migrants through the 80 miles (130 kilometers) of churning waters that separate Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic has typically moved in one direction for more than half a century: toward the U.S. territory. But the island's deep economic crisis is reversing this trend, with a growing number of financially strapped Puerto Ricans moving to the neighboring Caribbean country to open businesses and escape economic chaos that has scared away even many Dominican migrants.

Officials say it's hard to quantify exactly how many Puerto Ricans have moved to the Dominican Republic in recent years because they fall under the general category of U.S. citizens, but they say the trend is undeniable.

""It used to be extremely rare for a Puerto Rican to stop by and seek a work visa,"" said Franklin Grullon, the Dominican consul in the Puerto Rican capital of San Juan. ""There's been a surge in all types of visas, and we believe this flow will only increase.""

The majority of Puerto Ricans seeking business visas are young to middle-aged men, and many request permission to work in the tourism sector because they speak English and find it easy to get a job, Grullon said. They are drawn by the Dominican Republic's robust economy, which grew 7 percent in 2015 for the second consecutive year, making it the strongest in the Latin American and Caribbean region. The government has credited vigorous performances in banking, construction and tourism, noting that a record 5.6 million tourists visited the Dominican Republic last year.

There's also been a big increase in Puerto Rican professionals such as architects and engineers traveling to the Dominican Republic to work because of that country's booming construction sector, said German Monroig, executive director of the office of Puerto Rican affairs.

""There's been a considerable change in the last two years,"" he said.

It's hard for Puerto Rican professionals to find steady jobs given the island's economy, which has stagnated for nine years as the U.S. territory of 3.5 million people struggles with a 12 percent unemployment rate and a $72 billion public debt load the governor has said is unpayable and needs restructuring. About a third of people born in Puerto Rico now live on the U.S. mainland, seeking to escape tax increases, higher utility bills and dwindling job opportunities.

""Puerto Rico became very, very difficult for the casino sector,"" the 48-year-old Gonzalez said. ""I left just in time. ... All my friends tell me that the best thing I did was to leave, that Puerto Rico's situation is crazy.""

Puerto Ricans aren't the only ones leaving.

Grullon said Dominicans are increasingly moving back to their country, and he noted that the flow of Dominicans entering the U.S. territory illegally also has decreased dramatically: The U.S. Coast Guard detained 1,565 Dominicans in 2004, compared with 133 in 2014.

""What's surprising about this trend is that up until now, the migration had been from the Dominican Republic to Puerto Rico, and the main motive was a difference in salary and more jobs,"" said Jorge Duany, an anthropology professor at Florida International University who has long studied migration patterns between the two.

In the early 1900s, Puerto Ricans were moving to the Dominican Republic to work in the country's thriving sugar industry until the Great Depression hit. Then Dominican migrants began moving to Puerto Rico in the 1960s and 70s because of the island's booming industrial sector. Roughly 200,000 Dominicans are now estimated to live in the U.S. territory, though there are no precise figures because many live on the island illegally.

Now, it's the lure of more jobs and a powerful economy in the Dominican Republic that is attracting Puerto Ricans, including 51-year-old Francisco Perez.

He worked more than 20 years for an insurance company in Puerto Rico, but began to see his income shrink as car sales on the island plummeted. When a job opportunity presented itself in late 2014 to work for a Puerto Rican company in the Dominican Republic that paid in U.S. dollars, he took it.

""I told myself I had to do what I had to do given the importance I have as my family's provider,"" said the father of four. ""When I got here and saw that it was like Puerto Rico back in the 90s, that the economy was doing well, I stayed. I know there are a lot of Puerto Ricans looking over this way to grow their businesses.""

Among them is Gonzalez.

He originally moved to the Dominican Republic to work as a marketing manager for a Hard Rock Cafe in the popular beach resort of Punta Cana, but he quit nearly two months ago to open his own tour company there.

""We're at full blast,"" he said, noting that he already has several contracts with large hotels in the region. ""This is on the up and up.""

"Raging wildfires in Germany, Czech Republic are threatening tourist region","The raging wildfires in California and Texas aren't the only region of the world battling deadly flames.

A large wildfire on the German-Czech Republic border is spreading and threatening to destroy a forested national park popular with tourists.

The fire in the region, called Bohemian Switzerland on the Czech side and the Saxon Switzerland national park on the German side, started last weekend. It had seemed to be under control but spread again early Thursday, German news agency DPA reported.

Hundreds of firefighters on both sides of the border battled the flames with help from reinforcements from neighboring Poland and Slovakia. Eight firefighting helicopters were working to douse the flames in the hilly and rocky region that is difficult to access and where about 250 hectares (618 acres) of forest were burning Thursday.

Local authorities warned tourists to stay away from the area.

Photos from a local photographer show the devastation that had already been wrought -

Saxony state officials banned hikers from entering several forests in the region. To prevent additional blazes, they also asked local residents not to set off fireworks at private parties.

""It's all very tense. We can by no means speak of an easing"" of the fire yet; ""firefighters have reached the limits of their capabilities,"" Saxony Interior Minister Armin Schuster said.

Excalibur Army, a Czech company involved in rescue work and military involvement tweeted out its involvement, ""TRITON the special vehicle, developed by EXCALIBUR ARMY for fire rescue forces has being deployed to fight with the fire in Bohemian Switzerland in Czech republic. We wish @hasici_cr good luck and above all, lots of strength!""

The nonprofit rescue organization, Fire International Disaster Response Germany also reported from the scene ""#Saxony: Our mission in the #SaxonSwiss National Park continued today. Together with the local authorities and organizations, attempts are still being made to contain the extensive #forestfire, which is made more difficult by the difficult geographical conditions""

However, amid the carnage, was a sign of hope. The Fire Rescue services of the Czech Republic tweeted out video that the famous Pravčická brana still stands.

Another large forest fire in the Elbe-Elster district of the eastern German state of Brandenburg was under control Thursday after flaring up again on Wednesday evening, local authorities said. The fire was still burning an area of 500 hectares (1,236 acres).

A police helicopter scouted the area with a thermal camera to look for pockets of embers that could ignite into flames. Some areas are contaminated with World War II ammunition and are too dangerous for firefighters to enter because the heat or human contact could cause explosions.

Germany's army has sent several military helicopters to both fires to support local units.

Son of tourist who died Monday at Dominican resort says he's being pressured to allow cremating or embalming before body's return to US,"The son of a New York hospital technician who died suddenly in her room at an all-inclusive resort in Punta Cana says Dominican authorities are resisting doing toxicology tests and pressuring him to have her body cremated or embalmed before its return to the U.S.

Will Cox, 25, told Fox News on Friday that his mother, Leyla, who died Monday evening at the Excellence resort, was on a solo trip to celebrate her 53rd birthday and was in good health.

A Dominican police report, which Cox showed to Fox News, listed the cause of death as a heart attack.

Cox, who said he has been in daily contact with the U.S. Embassy in Santo Domingo, maintained that Dominican officials have stonewalled as he has tried to learn more about the circumstances of his mother’s death, and as he has pressed to have toxicology tests performed.

Cox said he did not speak directly to Dominican authorities, but rather communicated with embassy officials relaying information from the authorities.

“They put me against a wall,” Cox said, referring to Dominican authorities, in a telephone interview from his home in Tennessee. “The Dominicans said that I had to sign papers giving them permission to take her to a funeral home, and if I didn’t do that in four hours, they were going to consider her a 'Jane Doe.' They said I had to give them permission to cremate her or embalm her, or I would never get my mother back.”

""If they classified my mother as a Jane Doe, they told me I would be forfeiting the body,"" Cox said. ""I will never receive a death certificate. I will never receive my mother's remains. ... They did conduct an autopsy, but they will not tell me what it says.""

The news of her death comes as the popular Caribbean vacation destination grapples with a rash of deaths of U.S. tourists in their hotel rooms at various luxury resorts. Families of the tourists said they were generally in good health.

Of the seven deaths that have become publicly known so far, Dominican authorities said that five were caused by a heart attack. In the case of the other two -- an engaged Maryland couple who were found dead in their room on May 30 -- a final report on the cause of death is pending. In nearly all of them, Dominican authorities said there were signs of pulmonary edema -- a condition in which the lungs fill with fluid. The tourists ranged in age from 41 to 67.

The Dominican Ministry of Tourism has denounced what it sees as an overreaction to what it characterizes as coincidental.

Many of the tourists became critically and suddenly ill after consuming a beverage from the room minibar. The FBI told Fox News last week that is assisting Dominican investigators in looking into whether the tourists died of something other than natural causes. The New York Post, citing the Dominican Ministry of Public Health, reported that investigators are conducting tests on pools, air-conditioning units, food areas and alcohol at two Bahia Principe resorts where three visitors died.

The newspaper said that the Dominican National Police in 2017 dismantled five labs used for the manufacture of alcohol not safe for human consumption.

Cox said he does not know if his mother, who had trouble getting cell and Internet service from the resort, had a drink from the minibar or elsewhere in the resort. He said his efforts to get answers to those questions from the hotel and Dominican authorities have been futile.

The U.S. State Department on Friday said of Cox's death: ""We offer our sincerest condolences to the family on their loss. We are closely monitoring local authorities’ investigation into the cause of death.""

""We stand ready to provide all appropriate consular assistance,"" the statement to Fox News said. ""We refer you to the Dominican authorities regarding any ongoing investigation. Out of respect for family members and loved ones we cannot comment further.""

DOMINICAN OFFICIALS PLEAD FOR PATIENCE AS FBI, HEALTH SPECIALISTS PROBE TOURIST DEATHS

Cox said he shares the concerns that the relatives of six other U.S. tourists have expressed about the credibility of Dominican authorities' conclusions about the cause of death.

What's more, Cox said, U.S. Embassy officials -- who, the 25-year-old said, have been supportive and have called him every day -- told them that the Dominican authorities maintain that they cannot perform a toxicological test because their machines are broken.

""The U.S. Embassy communicated that to me and said that they don't know when the machines will be fixed,"" said Cox. ""I just feel like the Dominicans are covering their own tracks by getting rid of the evidence and evidence is my own mother. I never thought another country would do this to me.""

Efforts by Fox News to get a response from the U.S. Embassy in Santo Domingo and from the Dominican government were unsuccessful.

Leyla Cox's body is at the Blandino Funeral Home in Santo Domingo, her son said.

He was able to get an extension from the Dominican authorities until Monday to decide whether to give in and permit them to cremate or embalm her. That extension, Cox said, was granted after his congressional representatives and the U.S. Embassy negotiated with the Dominican government.

Cox said he has not been able to mourn his mother as he fights a David-vs.-Goliath battle with the Dominican government.

""I would love to see my Mom again,"" he said. ""But next time I see her, she may be ashes. It's just not right. I want to see her body. I'm a U.S. citizen, I have a right to see my mother's body. I have a right to know what happened. I want to perform an autopsy here, and get a toxicological test here, so I can get answers.""

In desperation, he said, he asked if with his mother's ashes, he could get a tube of her blood to have it tested in the United States, but was refused.

""It's been very hard for me emotionally,"" he said. ""What the Dominican Republic is making me do is help them cover up their own mistakes. I believe if my mother had not been in the Dominican Republic, or even if she had been anywhere else in the world, she would still be alive today.""

DOMINICAN REPUBLIC RESORT DEATHS MYSTERY: TIMELINE

On Friday, NBC reported another mysterious death, that of Jerry Curran, 78, of Ohio who checked into the Dreams resort in Punta Cana on Jan. 22, and died on Jan. 25.

The U.S. State Department confirmed Curran's death in the Dominican Republican to Fox News on Friday.

NBC quoted his daughter, Kellie Brown, as saying ""He went to the Dominican Republic healthy and he just never came back.""

NBC said that Brown was told a preliminary report listed one cause of death as pulmonary edema.

Brown said that it ""seems to be common in everyone else who's passed that we're learning about.""",https://www.foxnews.com/world/son-of-tourist-who-died-monday-at-dominican-resort-says-hes-being-pressured-to-allow-cremating-or-embalming-before-bodys-return-to-us,N/A
"Toxicologist says a colorless, odorless 'intoxicant' could be cause of Dominican Republic deaths","A toxicologist theorized Friday that the shocking number of sudden deaths stemming from visits to the Dominican Republic could be the result of toxic exposure.

Dr. Reynold Panettieri Jr., a Rutgers University vice chancellor, told ""Fox & Friends"" that the FBI is conducting extensive tests to determine what may have caused at least nine people to die after visiting resorts in the Dominican Republic in the last year.

""Some of these individuals, couples dying with no pre-existing illness, really suggests a potential toxic exposure,"" Dr. Panettieri said.

""Now that can be topical, ingested in the case of alcohol, or inhaled,"" he continued. ""Inhaled intoxicants could be odorless and colorless. You wouldn't know.""

The FBI revealed they are testing alcohol from at least one mini-bar in at least one of the rooms at the Bahia Principe resort, where a number of guests died, the New York Post reports. The FBI announced their involvement last week, and are reportedly taking blood samples from the individuals who died under suspicious circumstances.

DEATHS OF KANSAS MAN, PENNSYLVANIA WOMAN IN DOMINICAN REPUBLIC NEWLY SCRUTINIZED AMID SPATE OF TOURIST FATALITIES

Dr. Panettieri said that the toxicology results from the FBI will likely be revelatory because the department has access to extremely thorough tests.

""They are far more sensitive and specific than what we would do in toxicological testing in a hospital,"" he said.

The vacationers who died in the Dominican Republic all suffered from seemingly random health failures, primarily heart attacks or pulmonary edema - caused by fluid building up in the lungs. Dr. Panettieri said the situation is reminiscent of an incident in 2015, when a family was exposed to a toxic pesticide in the U.S. Virgin Islands and suffered pulmonary edema, leaving them with permanent injuries.

In the Dominican Republic, the frequency and manner of the deaths are particularly concerning because most of the victims were very healthy before their trip.

""It's very strange that suddenly out of the blue they would develop respiratory or cardiac failure,"" Dr. Panettieri said. ""Certainly, heart attacks could occur, don't get me wrong. But the fact that they're clustered in this manner is quite concerning,"" he said.

The source of the deaths in the Dominican Republic, however, is still a mystery.

"Tropical Storm Dorian strengthens, may threaten Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic as minimal hurricane","The fourth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season gathered strength Monday while approaching the islands in the eastern Caribbean Sea, as forecasters warn Tropical Storm Dorian could impact Puerto Rico and its neighbors later this week.

The National Hurricane Center said in its 2 p.m. ET update that Dorian is located about 95 miles east-southeast of Barbados, moving west-northwest at 14 mph with maximum sustained at 60 mph. Tropical storm conditions will move into the Winward Islands later today before Dorian moves toward Puerto Rico and Hispanola by Thursday, possibly as a hurricane, according to Fox News Senior Meteorologist Janice Dean.

""The good news is, it's a small hurricane, so even if it does strengthen it could actually also diminish in strength over the next couple of days as it interacts with land,"" Dean said Monday on ""Fox & Friends.""

2019 ATLANTIC HURRICANE SEASON NOW FAVORS 'ABOVE-NORMAL' ACTIVITY, WITH 10-17 NAMED STORMS, NOAA SAYS

Dorian is a small tropical system, with tropical-storm-force winds extending just 45 miles out from the center of the storm. Forecast models show the system possibly strengthening to a minimal hurricane by Thursday as it makes an approach near Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic.

A hurricane watch was issued for St. Lucia on Monday, as the NHC warned that ""hurricane conditions possible in portions of the northern Windward Islands.""

""Interests in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Hispaniola should monitor the progress of Dorian as watches could be required as early as later today,"" the NHC said.

The NHC issued tropical storm warnings for Barbados, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines. A tropical storm watch was issued for Grenada and Martinique. Dorian could bring 2-4 inches of rain in Barbados, the Windward Islands, and Dominica through Tuesday, with isolated maximum amounts of 6 inches of rain in the region, according to Dean.

Much of the eastern Caribbean island of Barbados shut down on Monday, as Prime Minister Mia Mottley closed schools and government offices across the island as she warned people to remain indoors.

""When you're dead, you're dead,"" she said in a televised address late Sunday. ""Stay inside and get some rest.""

In Puerto Rico, which is still feeling the impacts from Hurricane Maria in 2017, residents weren't taking their chances with facing a minimal hurricane.

""It's not as big as when Maria was going to come and people are already flocking to the convenience stores and department stores and just getting water,"" Richard Colon, who lives on the island, told FOX35 on Sunday.

HERE ARE THE DEADLIEST AND COSTLIEST HURRICANES TO HIT THE US MAINLAND

Dorian is the fourth named storm of the 2019 Atlantic hurricane season and comes nearly a week after Tropical Storm Chantal formed over the far Northern Atlantic. Subtropical storm Andrea formed on May 21 and quickly fizzled a day later over the Atlantic, southwest of Bermuda while Hurricane Barry, the second storm, made landfall in Louisiana on July 13 as a Category 1 storm.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration advised in its mid-season outlook that conditions in the Atlantic are leading to conditions that are more favorable for tropical activity as we approach September and October, the busiest months of hurricane season.

NOAA forecasters are now calling for 10-17 named storms with winds of 39 mph or higher, of which five to nine could strengthen into hurricanes. Of those storms, there will be two to four major hurricanes, which are classified as Category 3, 4, and 5 with winds of 111 mph or higher.

Dean said Monday an area of low pressure off the southeast coast could also develop over the next few days, but is not expected to affect land and only create swells and rip currents along the East Coast.

"Ukraine getting 90 refurbished T-72B tanks from US, the Netherlands, and Czech Republic","The United States, the Netherlands, and the Czech Republic have partnered up to send 90 refurbished T-72B main battle tanks to Ukraine as part of the Biden administration's latest $400 million weapons package.

The tanks, which have ""advanced optics, communications, and armor packages,"" will ""further enhance Ukraine’s proficient armored warfare capabilities,"" according to the Pentagon.

Ukraine has been asking for more tanks and other armored vehicles as the winter approaches.

""We're fighting the war out of our pickup trucks,"" a Ukrainian soldier told Radio Free Europe last month. ""It's going to be really tough for us.""

The Pentagon will pay for 45 of the refurbished T-72B tanks from the inventory of the Czech defense industry, while the Netherlands will provide funds for the other 45. The tanks will start arriving in Ukraine next month.

RUSSIA REJOINS UKRAINE GRAIN EXPORT WARTIME DEAL

The U.S. has so far declined to provide more modern tanks, such as the M-1 Abrams main battle tanks.

A senior U.S. defense official told reporters in September that the Pentagon recognizes in the long-term, Ukraine will ""need to transition to NATO compatible models.""

""Tanks are absolutely on the table along with other areas,"" the defense official said on Sept. 19.

""In terms of the immediate fight, the tanks that are available that could be provided very quickly with little to no training are Soviet-type tanks, but we’re certainly open to other options provided that the training, maintenance, and sustainment can be taken care of.""

Vice President Kamala Harris commends US alliance with 'Republic of North Korea' in DMZ speech gaffe,"Vice President Kamala Harris made an unfortunate gaffe during her speech at the Korean Peninsula's Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) on Thursday, saying that the U.S. has a ""strong alliance"" with ""the Republic of North Korea.""

""It is an alliance that is strong and enduring,"" she added, intending to refer to the Republic of Korea, which is South Korea's official name.

The vice president then continued her remarks by professing the U.S.' support for South Korea's defense against the increasingly aggressive North Korean government.

""I cannot state enough that the commitment of the United States to the defense of the Republic of Korea is iron-clad, and that we will do everything in our power to ensure that it has meaning in every way that the words suggest,"" Harris said.

VP KAMALA HARRIS VISITS JAPAN TO DISCUSS TAIWANESE SECURITY SITUATION: OFFICIAL

The heavily fortified DMZ, a buffer zone that separates North and South Korea, was Harris' final stop on her diplomatic trip to Asia. The gesture of visiting the DMZ is designed to illustrate America's ""rock-solid commitment"" to regional security, according to White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.

Harris began her visit by stopping at the Camp Bonifas Dining Facility and thanking American service members. She used binoculars to observe the DMZ, which is roughly 160 miles long and 2.5 miles wide. The vice president then headed to Observation Post Ouellette to give her speech about her commitment to South Korea's security.

Shortly before the DMZ visit, Harris met with South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol and praised the U.S.-South Korean alliance as a ""linchpin of security and prosperity."" She and Yoon also discussed South Korea's economic and technology partnerships with the U.S. earlier on Thursday, in addition to a gender equity roundtable.

The visit comes a day after North Korea fired a third ballistic missile into the sea in an act of provocation by Kim Jong-un. The country has previously fired two short-range ballistic missiles during Harris' stay in Japan.

North Korea also made a similar gesture in June by firing a trio of missiles before President Biden's visit to Seoul that month.

Harris condemned North Korea’s ""illicit weapons program"" during a Wednesday speech at United States Fleet Activities Yokosuka, a U.S. Naval base.

Jean-Pierre said North Korea's missile test was ""not unusual"" on Wednesday, while affirming that it would not dissuade Harris from visiting the DMZ.

""As you know, North Korea has a history of doing these types of tests,"" she said.

South Korean activists were seen protesting against Harris' visit near the Presidential Office in Seoul on Thursday. The protesters wore masks showing the faces of Harris and President Yoon as they demonstrated against the U.S.-South Korean alliance.

Harris' visit has also drawn criticism from Republicans who claim she has neglected the migrant crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border.
