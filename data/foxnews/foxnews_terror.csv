"Austin Butler says transforming into Elvis Presley for biopic included sleepless nights, waking up in ‘terror’","Austin Butler revealed he was ""All Shook Up"" over portraying Elvis Presley.

The 31-year-old actor confessed it was an intense experience preparing for his role, as he felt an immense amount of pressure to live up to the legendary singer.

In addition to the intimidating process, Butler admitted it was difficult to perfect his craft amid the coronavirus lockdowns, as he studied Presley for two years ahead of the movie.

AUSTIN BUTLER WAS HOSPITALIZED FOLLOWING 'ELVIS' BIOPIC PRODUCTION

""And then once I was allowed to leave the apartment… I would usually wake up every day around 3 or 4 in the morning with this terror,"" he explained during an appearance on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!""

""It was just such a daunting thing, and I really just was guided by my terror.""

In March 2021, Butler was diagnosed with a virus and was hospitalized for a week after he wrapped production.

""The next day I woke up at 4 in the morning with excruciating pain, and I was rushed to hospital,"" Butler told GQ last May.

""My body just started shutting down the day after I finished ‘Elvis.’""

He added that he created a compilation of Presley’s laughs and said he would practice his impersonation in public.

""I’d walk down the beach for hours, with a headphone in, laughing as Elvis… it looked like this man was absolutely out of his mind,"" Butler laughed.

Before his role as Elvis, Butler starred in Quentin Tarantino’s film ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood."" He described what it was like working with the famed director.

""It was greater than I could’ve imagined, he’s all those things that I thought he would be… an amazing filmmaker, a visionary and a great leader,"" the ""Elvis"" star said.",https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/austin-butler-elvis-presley-biopic-sleepless-nights-terror,N/A
"On this day in history, Oct. 12, 2000, terror attack on USS Cole kills 17 American sailors, wounds dozens","The USS Cole suffered a surprise attack by al Qaeda suicide bombers while at port in Yemen — killing 17 American sailors and wounding about three dozen others, on this day in history, Oct. 12, 2000.

It proved an ill-heeded harbinger of much more terrifying al Qaeda attacks on the United States' homeland 11 months later.

""Sadly, it took the grievous attack on 9/11 for us to collectively realize that al Qaeda presented a truly consequential threat to America’s security,"" Admiral Christopher W. Grady, now vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the nation's second-highest ranking military officer, wrote during a 20th anniversary retrospective of the attack.

ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, OCT. 11, 1890, DAUGHTERS OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION FOUNDED IN WASHINGTON DC

Grady commanded the USS Cole from 2003 to 2004.

The U.S Navy guided-missile destroyer was in the port of Aden to refuel when two men pulled up alongside the vessel in a motorboat, reportedly making friendly gestures to the American warship.

They then detonated 1,000 pounds of explosives.

The blast and inferno devastated the Cole and its crew.

In addition to the human carnage, the explosion blew a 40-foot hole through the ship's hull at the waterline.

AMERICA'S FENTANYL CRISIS: ‘IT’S AN INVASION,' SAYS WILLIAM BENNETT, FORMER DRUG CZAR

""The Cole crew fought valiantly for more than 96 hours to rescue their shipmates and save their ship under extremely dangerous conditions,"" wrote Admiral Grady.

Reports said that 36 to 40 sailors were wounded.

""I see reflections of the Cole heroes in today’s sailors."" — Admiral Christopher W. Grady

International allies rallied to the aid of the American sailors and the vessel.

The HMS Marlborough was the first ship to arrive and offer aid. The French air force assisted evacuations.

The USS Cole was repaired and returned to sea in 2003.

It's still in service today.

Most of the sailors killed in the attack were in their teens or 20s. They hailed from across the nation and represented a broad cross-section of the American people.

""The world was shocked out of its complacency 11 months after the USS Cole attack, on Sept. 11, 2001.""

Those killed were the following individuals.

Kenneth E. Clodfelter, 21, Mechanicsville, Virginia; Richard Costelow, 35, Morrisville, Pennsylvania.; Lakeina M. Francis, 19, Woodleaf, North Carolina; Timothy L. Gauna, 21, Rice, Texas; Cherone L.

Wibberley, 19, Williamsport, Maryland.

The sudden deaths of 17 brave young sailors were still not enough to raise greater awareness of the al Qaeda threat, both among the American public and among government officials.

""As al-Qaeda threats to American interests multiplied in the late 1990s, U.S. government officials had various opportunities to act against Osama bin Laden,"" the 9/11 Memorial Museum noted.

""In 1998, a series of bombings in Afghanistan killed dozens of terrorists at training camps but missed bin Laden. That same year, an operation to capture bin Laden at the terrorist organization’s training camp and headquarters at Tarnak Farms was canceled due to concerns about civilian casualties and the mission’s legality.""

The world was shocked out of its complacency on Sept. 11, 2001, with the Usama bin Laden-led al Qaeda terror attacks that killed 3,000 people and dramatically reshaped geopolitics.

""The USS Cole bombing followed an unsuccessful attempt on January 3, 2000, to bomb another U.S. Navy ship, the USS The Sullivans,"" the FBI reported in its history of the attack.

""In this earlier incident, the terrorist boat sank before the explosives could be detonated; however, the boat and the explosives were salvaged. The boat was then refitted, and the explosives were tested and reused in the USS Cole attack.""

Air marshals outraged at Biden admin for border deployments despite terror threat: 'Absolutely madness',"Federal air marshals are outraged as the Biden administration continues to send them to the southern border despite a renewed terror threat from al Qaeda.

Air Marshal National Council Executive Director Sonya Labosco joined ""Fox & Friends First"" Tuesday to discuss why the diversion has put Americans at risk and why they are going to ""suffer"" as a result of the move.

""It looks absolutely insane,"" Labosco told co-host Todd Piro. ""We don't understand why these decisions are being made. The intel is clear. Al Qaeda is watching for our weak areas. Our aviation is a high-risk area. We're not protecting our aviation domain, and we're going to the border. It is absolutely madness.""

US OFFICIALS MEET WITH TALIBAN IN PERSON FOR FIRST TIME SINCE DRONE STRIKE KILLED AL QAEDA CHIEF IN KABUL

High-level Department of Homeland Security (DHS) sources told Judicial Review that ""al Qaeda says upcoming attacks on US possibly involving planes, will use new techniques and tactics.""

Despite the looming terror threat, the Biden administration announced mandatory deployments to the border as the migrant surge continues to strain already-worsening conditions amid staffing shortages.

Many agents pushed back on the Biden administration over the move, expressing willingness to refuse the deployment and face possible termination.

Labosco suggested the mandatory diversions may not have sufficient legal grounds.

US TAKES OUT AL QAEDA LEADER AYMAN AL-ZAWAHRI IN ‘SUCCESSFUL’ AFGHANISTAN COUNTERTERRORISM OPERATION

""We do believe it's a violation,"" Labosco said. ""We do believe that DHS has overstepped their bounds. We are waiting for Congress to get sworn in, hopefully today, and we can get some movement here. We need someone to step in, in Congress, and stop the deployment of federal air marshals.""

""This statute, when it was originally a tent and set by Congress, was not to deploy air marshals to the border, and to be clear, there is no national emergency,"" she continued. ""There's been no national emergency declared at this point. So we're still saying that it is we need an injunction from Congress that they cannot send us to the border.""

The Air Marshal National Council sent a letter to DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas over the weekend, calling out the administration for the policy since the border crisis has garnered little attention.

""How can you justify sending FAMs to the border in huge numbers, when the border is in your words secure, and there is no emergency yet?"" the letter read. ""Yet we have major security incidents happening right now affecting our aviation security.""

Even amid the diversion, Labosco noted the American people have not forgotten the critical lessons learned following the devastating 9/11 attacks, more than two decades after thousands lost their lives.

""I can tell you who hasn't forgotten, we haven't forgotten,"" Labosco said. ""The American people, the family and friends of those that died on 911, they haven't forgotten.""

""We're not we're not going to catch al Qaeda trying to grab an airplane down in El Paso,"" she continued. ""It's going to happen right here in a commercial airport, in a commercial aircraft.""

In a statement to Fox News Digital, a DHS spokesperson pushed back on the claim that flights are being left vulnerable.

""Federal Air Marshals have long supported various Departmental operations on a regular basis across Democratic and Republican administrations alike. There is nothing new or unique about this. They have been deployed to support the U.N. General Assembly, Operation Allies Welcome, hurricane recovery efforts, and CBP at the Southwest border. The last Administration in 2019 temporarily deployed some Federal Air Marshals to support CBP at the Southwest border.

""The suggestion that flights are being left unprotected is completely false. TSA takes its responsibility to secure the skies for the traveling public very seriously. We will continue to protect commercial flights through our multi-layered security processes, including through the Federal Air Marshal Service which supports this critical mission on the ground and onboard aircrafts,"" the statement read.",https://www.foxnews.com/media/air-marshals-outraged-biden-admin-border-deployments-despite-terror-threat-absolutely-madness,N/A
Venezuelan national on FBI's terror watchlist released into Michigan after crossing border: LeDuff,"Michigan investigative journalist Charlie LeDuff told Fox News on Thursday that a Lebanese-born Venezuelan national listed on the FBI's terror watchlist was released into the United States after crossing the border illegally.

According to LeDuff's reporting for Deadline Detroit, Issam Bazzi, who was caught near the Rio Grande River in Texas last November, was released on his own recognizance ahead of his March asylum hearing in Detroit. Bazzi reportedly traveled to the U.S. illegally with his wife and daughter, said LeDuff.

Bazzi got ""word that the Biden administration has given asylum to Venezuelans. He, his daughter, and his wife fly to Monterrey, Mexico, hire a smuggler, get rafted over into Brownsville, Texas, wants asylum,"" LeDuff explained on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight.""

""He is not only on the terror watch list. The hit comes back high derogatory information affiliated with an unspecified group. Classified information,"" said LeDuff.

Despite this, Bazzi was reportedly released into the U.S. because his weight deemed him at high risk for COVID, the journalist told Tucker Carlson.

""The important thing here is that we all wondered, who got in? Did terrorists get in? We now know that the government has a known terrorist that they let go. Why? Because he’s a high COVID risk. Why? Because he is overweight. So now in my community we get this guy. Nobody I know in the federal government, probably nobody you know, has ever heard about letting somebody high up on the terror watch list into the interior of this country. It is ridiculous,"" LeDuff said.

CBP DELETES PRESS RELEASE OUTLINING ARREST OF YEMENI BORDER CROSSERS ON TERROR WATCH LIST

The FBI reportedly interrogated Bazzi and opposed his release. Local ICE agents deemed him a ""flight risk.""

""But in the great wisdom of Washington, this is the new normal,"" LeDuff said.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents arrested two other men on the FBI's terrorism watchlist last year as they tried to cross the southern U.S. border, the agency said.

Biden's next dangerous nominee continues reign of energy terror,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

The Democrats’ aggressive push to criminalize various parts of the energy industry was further evident this week when states like California passed a rule making it illegal to purchase gasoline fueled vehicles by 2035. Even the Inflation Reduction Act passed by the Democrats and signed by President Joe Biden and the Democrats should have been named the Climate Change Obsession Act because of the billions of dollars being spent on making their carbon-neutral fantasy seam feasible.

Federal funds and state and federal legislation are part of a broader scheme by the Democrats to force Americans to change their behavior when it comes to using fossil fuels. They are also focused on nominating a parade of dangerous, anti-American energy nominees for top government jobs. The most recent of these nominees could end up doing the most damage to our already struggling economy.

In January 2021, Biden began his reign of energy terror by nominating Rep. Deb Haaland to serve as Interior Secretary. Her resume to that point included being one of the House sponsors of the Green New Deal, pledging to vote against all new fossil fuel infrastructure, and stating that she was ""wholeheartedly against fracking and drilling on public lands.""

Unfortunately, this time a politician kept their word. Since becoming Secretary, she oversaw Biden’s moratorium on oil and gas leasing on federal lands and has held just one offshore oil and gas lease sale, but only because she was compelled by the courts.

TUCKER CARLSON: CALIFORNIA'S LEADERS KNOW NOTHING ABOUT ENERGY

Next was Tracy Stone-Manning, the eco-terrorist conspirator nominated to oversee the nation’s public lands. During her nomination fight, it became clear from past court documents and testimony that Stone-Manning sent a threatening, anonymous letter to authorities on behalf of ""tree spikers""—who insert spikes in trees to injure loggers—and then spent years covering up their crimes. Only when she was promised legal immunity did she cooperate with investigators. She now runs the agency that determines if energy companies receive leases to operate on federal lands.

Finally, there was Sarah Bloom Raskin’s nomination to the Fed. As the American people struggle with historically high inflation and energy prices, Raskin opposes fossil fuels and argued that banks should stop investing in oil, gas, and coal companies. Thankfully, the outcry from sensible Americans reached the halls of Congress, blocking her confirmation. We now need to do that again.

Then in May, President Biden nominated Richard Glick to continue serving as the chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). This little-known commission is responsible for approving natural gas pipeline projects and for ensuring American energy is getting from point A to point B.

But earlier this year, Glick and his fellow Democratic commissioners tried to undercut that mission. In February, Glick led the charge as FERC jammed through a new regulatory policy for natural gas infrastructure projects. Under the new rule, any company looking to build a natural gas pipeline would have to account for all greenhouse gas emissions while it’s being built and in operation. This task is essentially impossible and would significantly delay, or stop entirely, these important projects, creating an enormous burden on American energy companies and workers.

The bipartisan ire from Capitol Hill was swift and fierce. Glick and his compatriots were made to explain why they sought to kill natural gas projects while the American people struggled to pay their heating bills. The public shaming did the trick and Glick paused the regulation, likely with an eye toward his coming nomination fight.

Now that fight is upon us, and the stakes couldn’t be higher. You can bet that if Glick is confirmed to another full term at FERC, he will quickly resurrect his natural gas policy.

The Biden administration has not been shy about their disdain for fossil fuels and the American people are feeling the effects. In June, the average gasoline price surged to over $5 per gallon, while the Biden administration continued to block oil and gas production on federal lands. Now, Richard Glick wants to block natural gas pipelines as prices for that fuel hit 14-year highs and that’s before Americans turn on the heat in their homes.

The high-level nominations coming from the White House have been a disaster for American energy workers and consumers. If Richard Glick’s nomination is not blocked by the U.S. Senate this fall, Americans can expect to see an even more aggressive push by these little-known government agencies, which harness way too much power in name of climate change with disdain for the American consumer.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/biden-next-dangerous-nominee-continues-reign-energy-terror,N/A
"Our leaders are wrong, the War on Terror is not over","next Image 1 of 2

prev Image 2 of 2

Today is the 11th anniversary of the September 11 terror attacks. Bin Laden is dead. Al Qaeda hasn’t had a successful attack on Americans for years. President Obama has declared the War on Terror over. So why do most Americans have a nagging sense that it’s not over?

Why do we still go through a striptease every time we board a plane, or shuffle through metal detectors when we enter public buildings? Why do officials tell us we should immediately report to the police we when notice an unclaimed backpack or piece of luggage? If the War on Terror is over, why can’t we go back to the way things were before September 11th?

Because the War on Terror isn’t over, not really. Yes, the Iraq War might be over, and the Afghan War has a termination date in sight, but there is still a terrorist threat looming over us. And we’re not comfortable with it. We don’t like unfinished business, or ambiguity, and the War on Terror still feels like both.



The world laughs at Americans for having a notoriously short attention span. Our women don’t like last year’s fashions, our men don’t like last year’s car models, and our children certainly don’t like last year’s music. Americans thrive on reinvention. We’re the same way with wars; we have no patience for long wars, whether it’s the War on Poverty, or the War on Drugs, or the War on Terror. We’re not very good at long term, low- grade chronic problems. We’re terrific at dealing with acute crises, and that’s how we like our wars. We prefer wars which have a beginning, and middle and a victorious end.



When we’re in a war we focus all our national attention on it, and when it’s over and we’ve won, we go on to resume our old lives or, even better, remake new ones. For us, war is an abnormal state of affairs, which interrupts the peace. It’s an acute crisis that summons all our national energy to defeat it. After the Civil War, or World War I, or World War II, Americans launched new industries, created new social rules, invented new opportunities. We don’t dwell in the past, and we don’t hold grudges, either. Ten years after the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor, we signed a mutual defense treaty with Japan. Twenty years later we were each other’s major trading partners.

[pullquote]



But this time, with the War on Terror, things are different. We still commemorate September 11. We did on the tenth anniversary, and we’ll do it today on the eleventh anniversary. Compare that to World War II. FDR called the attack on Pearl Harbor a day that would live on in ""infamy,"" but by that tenth anniversary the Greatest Generation had put that war behind them and moved on.



Why can’t we move on this time? Because it doesn’t feel like this is a war that’s finished; while our enemies may be down, they’re not out.

Al Qaeda may be a shadow of its former self in Pakistan and Afghanistan, but it’s moved on and regenerated in Africa and the Middle East. Al Qaeda and other jihadists movements don’t see this conflict as something that has a beginning, a middle and an end. They don’t see war as something which is concluded with a peace agreement, when both sides lay down their arms and pick up their lives. They see war as the normal state of affairs. For them peace is just the period between wars, when the sides regroup to fight again. They see peace as the aberration, not war. When do they think peace comes? Only when they’ve annihilated their enemies.



And that’s why we still commemorate September 11. We realize that the War on Terror is unfinished business, despite what our political leaders tell us. And, as uncomfortable as it is to live with, it’s a war we must ultimately win. Our enemies see this as a fight to the finish. If it’s a fight they ultimately win, the world will enter a prolonged era of darkness. It will be a new dark ages with genocide, tribe against tribe, religion against religion, race against race, and fought with the most dangerous weapons in history.



That’s why it is imperative that we fix our economy, resume our traditional role in the world and once more lead from the front. America is the world’s one essential country. If we don’t lead, who will take our place and set the rules by which the international community is governed? Most likely it will be countries which do not share our values, love our freedom, or believe that man has the right to choose his own leaders. It will be countries which do not share our sense of fair play, or rush to aid victims of natural disaster, or believe in helping the less fortunate. Or even worse, no country will lead and the world will descend into chaos where there are no rules, where it's every nation or tribe for itself.



The War on Terror was not a war of our choosing, and it’s not a war on our timetable. But it’s a war we must win nonetheless.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/our-leaders-are-wrong-the-war-on-terror-is-not-over,N/A
"Steve Hilton: Islamic terror is not a law enforcement puzzle, it’s a war. Here’s how to show we get it","Programming Alert: Watch ""The Next Revolution with Steve Hilton"" Sunday evenings at 9pm ET on Fox News Channel.

Another sickening Islamist terror attack, this time on the streets of New York. On each occasion we seem to go through the same ritual -- sympathy, condemnation, a parade of well-meaning statements from government officials insisting that the terrorists “will not win.”

Fine. But forgive me for feeling a certain sense of frustration. The truth is, we are not taking this threat seriously enough. Our response needs to be much more aggressive.

First though, let’s give credit where it’s due. Our brave men and women have taken the fight to ISIS in the Middle East, and by all accounts have done a spectacular job. For years, our security services have worked patiently and relentlessly to track down terror plots. They have foiled many and saved countless lives. For that we should be unequivocally grateful.

It’s not their response that I question: but the response of our leaders, in government and the bureaucracy. They still seem to be treating Islamist terror as a law enforcement issue, rather than what it is: a war waged on us by an ideologically-driven and globally-distributed enemy.

Big Tech is investing billions in artificial intelligence and virtual reality -- let’s see some of that directed towards identifying potential terrorist murderers.

Here are four things we could do that would show we are serious in this fight.

First, we should remove all known Islamists from our country. If they are not U.S. citizens, they should be immediately deported. If they are naturalized U.S. citizens, they should first have their citizenship revoked. As the former head of the UK’s crisis response committee, Colonel Richard Kemp said after the Manchester terror attack earlier this year, “Every single person who we have intelligence upon, who is known to be involved in terrorism...we deport and send them back to where they came from. We do not allow them to roam free on our streets and murder and maim and disfigure our children.”

Of course, in order to do this we need to know how many such people there are. After Manchester, British authorities announced that they know of 23,000 Islamist extremists who are potential terrorist attackers living in the UK. How many are there in America? It’s time the FBI told us.

Second, we must force the big tech companies to help our security services track down terrorists and prevent attacks. When there’s money to be made, there’s no limit to Silicon Valley’s ingenuity -- or invasion of privacy. Google announced earlier this year that it can track your online browsing and your movements in the real world by combining credit card data with data from your smartphone and services like Google Maps. But when the authorities ask tech firms to help in the fight against terror, suddenly they’re all about privacy. Big Tech is investing billions in artificial intelligence and virtual reality -- let’s see some of that directed towards identifying potential terrorist murderers.

Third, we need to force Saudi Arabia to pay reparations for their role in incubating today’s terror threat. Over the years, the Saudis have funded a huge number mosques in the world -- and with that funding came the vile, medieval strain of Islam known as Wahhabism (or Salafism) that is at the heart of today’s Islamist ideology, whether practiced by ISIS, Al Qaeda or any other of the murderous death cults. The least the Saudis could now do is put some of their oil riches towards building and supporting moderate mosques on the same scale they funded extremist ones.

Fourth, we need to toughen our own immigration procedures, just as President Trump pledged to do this week. No more entry by lottery; extreme vetting for everyone who wants to come to America and fits the profile of a potential Islamist supporter or sympathizer -- whether they have become radicalized or not.

These are just some of the steps we need to take and we’ll be debating them this Sunday on my show, “The Next Revolution” at 9pm ET on Fox News Channel. Hope you can join us!",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/steve-hilton-islamic-terror-is-not-a-law-enforcement-puzzle-its-a-war-heres-how-to-show-we-get-it,N/A
42 migrants on terror watchlist arrested attempting to enter US illegally under Biden: CBP data,"More than 40 migrants on the terror watchlist have been arrested by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) trying to enter the country illegally since President Biden took office, according to newly released CBP data.

The data, sent to lawmakers in response to a congressional inquiry and obtained by Fox News Digital, says that since Jan. 20, 2021, U.S. Border Patrol and the Office of Field Operations has ""arrested 42 subjects who were on the terror watchlist and attempted to enter the United States illegally.""

BORDER PATROL STOPPED 23 PEOPLE ON TERRORIST DATABASE AT SOUTHERN BORDER IN 2021: CBP DATA

The Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) contains information about the identities of those who are known or ""reasonably suspected"" of being involved in terrorist activities. Republican lawmakers have repeatedly called for the number of those encountered at the border to be made public by the administration.

The number does not count the number who got past overwhelmed Border Patrol agents at the southern border. Fox News reported earlier this month that over 62,000 illegal immigrants evaded Border Patrol agents in March alone, averaging about 2,000 a day.

The latest information from CBP comes in response to an inquiry in August from 20 House Republicans led by Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, which called for the Department of Homeland Security to provide a slew of information about the ongoing crisis at the southern border. The lawmakers asked for the number of migrants who entered unlawfully and ""are included on a list maintained by the Federal Government relating to terrorists or individuals prohibited from boarding a commercial aircraft.""

The lawmakers had hit out at the agency for a lack of transparency.

HOUSE REPUBLICANS PUSH BIDEN ADMIN FOR INFORMATION ON MIGRANTS ON TERROR DATABASE

""Due to the unprecedented nature of this crisis, it is dangerously irresponsible for your Department to not be as transparent as possible with the American people, the states of this union and the localities facing the frontline effects of this crisis,"" that letter said.

Fox News had previously reported that 23 individuals had been apprehended across the southern border by Border Patrol between Jan. 20 and the end of December. This latest figure includes the Office of Field Operations (OFO) data, and therefore includes those encountered at ports of entry. The information includes nationwide arrests and is not specific to the southern border.

Former Border Patrol Chief Rodney Scott had repeatedly sounded the alarm over the number of TSDBs coming across the border, telling fellow agents last year that it was ""at a level we have never seen before.""

WHITE HOUSE SAYS TERRORIST ENCOUNTERS AT BORDER ‘UNCOMMON,' TOUTS BORDER PATROL FOR ‘DOING THEIR JOB’

""We have terrorist threats we can’t get into in this type of a forum but they are real,"" he told Fox News’ Bret Baier in October.

The number of TSDB encounters comes as the Biden administration released its border numbers for March on Monday, showing more than 220,000 encounters -- the highest of Biden’s presidency.

The data sent by CBP to lawmakers also details the costs of the care of migrants. Since January 20, CBP has spent $95 million of federal funding on personnel, $338 million on infrastructure, $98 million on utilities and food and $166 million on healthcare. Additionally, it has spent $12 million on transporting migrants by vehicle and $36 million on transporting them by airplane.

"Afghan rebel group asks for Biden’s support, warns of new terror threats","Afghanistan's lead resistance group, the National Resistance Front (NRF), has one message for the Biden administration: don't ignore terror threats coming from Afghanistan. The group noted that mistake was made by the Clinton administration in the lead up to the 9/11 terror attacks.

In a statement to Fox News Digital, the NFR's head of foreign relations, Ali Maisam Nazary, said the time for action is now.

""Our message to the Biden administration is to not make the same mistake the Clinton administration (made) when they ignored the threat of terrorism in the mid and late 1990s and led to 9/11. The White House has to act fast and adopt a proactive approach to counterterrorism by allowing democratic and anti-terrorist forces like the NRF to liberate Afghanistan,"" he said.

TALIBAN'S POWER CHALLENGED BY AFGHAN RESISTANCE FRONT, ISIS-K

The warning comes as the Taliban is facing a new low-intensity campaign in the north from rebels, who in recent weeks have launched attacks against its fighters.

Afghanistan’s fighting season is known to start in the spring and generally run through October. In previous years this was when the Taliban and its allies would wage attacks against U.S. forces and the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF).

The current fighting is largely happening in the north of the country and is being led by the NRF in the country’s Panjshir Valley, a rugged and mountainous bastion of anti-Taliban resistance north of Kabul where the Taliban consolidated its control last September.

The NRF, led by Ahmad Massoud, is viewed as the most formidable Afghan resistance unit fighting the Taliban, and its leader has vowed to continue the fight even after the loss of its rear base in the Panjshir Valley. Massoud’s father, Ahmad Shah Massoud, was a prominent Mujahidin rebel who fought against the Soviets in 1980s and was assassinated by al Qaeda operatives just two days before the 9/11 attacks.

AFGHAN CITIZENS WHO HELPED US NOW WAITING IN LIMBO FOR VISA APPROVAL MONTHS AFTER EVACUATING

The NRF has extensive knowledge of the difficult terrain in Afghanistan, and like the Taliban’s insurgency against U.S. forces, will utilize asymmetric tactics against the better equipped Taliban.

Even though overthrowing the Taliban is highly unlikely, especially without an external patron, that doesn’t mean the NRF won’t cause trouble for the Taliban. Sibghattullah Ahmadi, a spokesperson for the NRF, said in a tweet earlier this month that the Taliban launched an attack at the Shaba base and lost eight fighters to NRF forces.

Ali Maisam Nazary said the NRF is taking the fight to the Taliban in the spring fighting season.

""There has been an offensive by NRF in Panjshir, Baghlan, Takhar and Badakhshan provinces and even with reinforcements the Taliban faced causalities the NRF inflicted, including prominent commanders in the past 10 days and the fighting is still going on,"" Nazary told Fox News Digital.

He added, ""This shows us their weaknesses, and their supposed strength from the leftover U.S. equipment was useless.""

He also claimed the Taliban are committing war crimes and have increased attacks on civilians in a desperate attempt to regain control of restive provinces.

Taliban officials initially denied the fighting but then were forced to acknowledge it when photographs of their dead began to spread on the internet and social media. Fox News Digital has not independently confirmed the below photo supplied by the National Resistance Front. The photo is said to show Taliban casualties from recent fighting between the two sides.

WARNING:IMAGE BELOW MAY BE DISTURBING

Resistance to the Taliban has not only come from the NRF but includes other lesser-known armed groups that share the common goal of dislodging the Taliban from power. Beyond their desire for a Taliban-free Afghanistan, there is very little cooperation or coordination among the disparate groups, which hinders their ability to seriously challenge the Taliban.

Most analysts and observers do not view the National Resistance Front or other armed groups as an existential threat to the Taliban’s hold on power. External backing is a key ingredient to sustaining a successful insurgent campaign and so far, the NRF lacks any major outside support.

""For the NRF to pose a real strategic threat to the Taliban, they will need to gain stronger external support, for supplies of weapons, shelter and training. But neighboring states are still more worried about a destabilized Afghanistan than about assisting to overthrow the Taliban, so there is only moderate support for the NRF abroad"", noted Roger Baker, director at Stratfor Center for Applied Geopolitics at RANE.

There also does not appear to be any appetite from the Biden administration or Congress to fund the anti-Taliban resistance. While the Biden administration continues to honor the withdrawal agreement struck during the Trump administration, analysts believe it has no interest in funding the nascent anti-Taliban insurgency.

Observers warn that a significant U.S. investment in the NRF would likely destabilize Afghanistan further and could exacerbate the already catastrophic humanitarian crisis. While the Taliban are likely to remain in power, it’s clear their new government is struggling to pacify the entire country.

Afghanistan’s Islamic State affiliate, known as the Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISIS-K), also poses a threat to Afghanistan’s stability. Unlike most of the resistance groups that desire a free and democratic Afghanistan, ISIS-K is committed to an uncompromising goal of creating a transnational Islamic caliphate and regards the Taliban as apostates for negotiating with the United States.

ISIS-K recently claimed responsibility for a string of terror attacks in Mazar-i-Sharif and Kunduz in late April, killing at least 20 people. A United Nations report in February, estimated that ISIS-K's strength in Afghanistan has almost doubled from 2,200 members to almost 4,000.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/afghan-rebel-group-asks-bidens-support-warns-new-terror-threats,N/A
"Airline terror warning prompted by Al Qaeda affiliate threat, sources say","A security threat issued this week that warned airlines of shoe bomb attacks was prompted by heightened U.S. concerns about Al Qaeda's Yemen-based affiliate, senior law enforcement officials told Fox News.

The Department of Homeland Security issued the warning on Wednesday about U.S.-bound flights out of concern that Ibrahim Hassaon al-Asiri, a Saudi believed to have been behind previous failed attempts to attack planes, may have come up with new bomb designs that could evade airport security measures, the sources said.

Al-Asiri is considered by U.S. officials to be the best terrorist bomb-maker in operation today. He was behind the failed 2009 attempted bombing of an airliner over Detroit on Christmas Day by a Nigerian militant who had an explosive charge built into his underwear, as well as cargo printer bombs that had explosives packed in toner cartridges. Those bombs were intercepted. There has been credible intelligence in the past that al-Asiri has been training and sharing his bomb-making skills with others.

The bulletin called on screeners to increase their use of explosive detection swabs on passengers’ shoes. Fox News was told these very visible changes to security procedures are expected at airports overseas and not domestically, and passengers flying into the United States can also expect more pat-downs. Among the airports being advised to add extra security are Amsterdam's Schiphol airport, London's Gatwick Airport and Manchester Airport in England.

The warning was not related to the Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. Earlier in the month, federal authorities had warned about possible attempts by terrorists to use toothpaste tube-based bombs on flights between Russia and the United States.

More On This...

Earlier Thursday, Jeh Johnson, the Homeland Security Department secretary, said that the latest warning was a routine advisory issued in response to the latest intelligence.

""As you know, concerns about shoe bombs have been out there for years,"" Johnson said during a news conference at Los Angeles International Airport. ""Every once in a while we update our advisories, we modify our procedures, so we remain vigilant in dealing with the various potential threats that exist.""

A U.S. intelligence official told The Associated Press that DHS released a notice to airlines reiterating that liquids, shoes and certain cosmetics were of concern. The warning was focused on international flights into the United States.

Johnson also commented on his decision Wednesday to withdraw a contract proposal asking a private company to give the government access to a nationwide database of license plate tracking information.

The proposal said Immigration and Customs Enforcement was planning to use the license plate data in pursuit of criminal immigrants and others sought by authorities.

""I think that any proposal of that nature should require a careful review as it concerns privacy, civil liberties concerns, at the senior levels of the department, including myself, so that's why I did it,"" Johnson said.

Johnson spoke to a crowd of reporters beyond the screening checkpoint area while flanked by six Transportation Security Administration officers. He emphasized multiple times in his opening remarks that he'd come to LAX to ""express solidarity with my TSA colleagues."" The agency lost its first officer in the line of duty during a Nov. 1 attack at the airport by a gunman targeting the agency's employees. Two other TSA officers and a traveler was wounded.

TSA is conducting a review of airport security policies as a result of the shooting. That's in addition to a separate investigation into the shooting the airport's expected to make public next month.

""I asked them (TSA officers) directly: 'Tell me what more we can do,'"" Johnson said. He said he agreed with TSA Administrator John Pistole's decision to reject arming officers in response to the attack.

"Anatomy of the terror threat: Files show hundreds of US plots, refugee connection","Newly obtained congressional data shows hundreds of terror plots have been stopped in the U.S. since 9/11 – mostly involving foreign-born suspects, including dozens of refugees.

The files are sure to inflame the debate over the Obama administration’s push to admit thousands more refugees from Syria and elsewhere, a proposal Donald Trump has vehemently opposed on the 2016 campaign trail.

“[T]hese data make clear that the United States not only lacks the ability to properly screen individuals prior to their arrival, but also that our nation has an unprecedented assimilation problem,” Sens. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., and Ted Cruz, R-Texas, told President Obama in a June 14 letter, obtained by FoxNews.com.

The files also give fresh insight into the true scope of the terror threat and cover a wide range of cases, including:

A Seattle man plotting to attack a U.S. military facility

An Atlantic City man using his “Revolution Muslim” site to encourage confrontations with U.S. Jewish leaders “at their homes”

An Iraq refugee arrested in January, accused of traveling to Syria to “take up arms” with terror groups

While the June 12 massacre at an Orlando gay nightclub marked the deadliest terror attack on U.S. soil since 2001, the data shows America has been facing a steady stream of plots. For the period September 2001 through 2014, data shows the U.S. successfully prosecuted 580 individuals for terrorism and terror-related cases. Further, since early 2014, at least 131 individuals were identified as being implicated in terror.

Across both those groups, the senators reported that at least 40 people initially admitted to the U.S. as refugees later were convicted or implicated in terror cases.

Among the 580 convicted, they said, at least 380 were foreign-born. The top countries of origin were Pakistan, Lebanon and Somalia, as well as the Palestinian territories.

Both Sessions and Cruz sit on the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest, which compiled the terror-case information based on data from the Justice Department, news reports and other open-source information. The files were shared with FoxNews.com.

The files include dates, states of residence, countries of origin for foreign-born suspects, and reams of other details.

Specifically, they show a sharp spike in cases in 2015, largely stemming from the arrest of suspects claiming allegiance to the Islamic State. They also show a heavy concentration of cases involving suspects from California, Texas, New York and Minnesota, among other states.

EXPLORE THE DATA IN THE MAPS AND CHARTS BELOW

The senators say the terror-case repository still is missing critical details on suspects’ immigration history, which they say the Department of Homeland Security has “failed to provide.” Immigration data the senators compiled came from other sources.

Sessions and Cruz asked the president in their letter to order the departments of Justice, Homeland Security and State to ""update"" and provide more detailed information. The senators have sent several letters to those departments since last year requesting immigration histories of those tied to terror.

“The administration refuses to give out the information necessary to establish a sound policy that protects Americans from terrorists,” Sessions said in a statement to Fox News.

Asked about the complaints, DHS spokeswoman Gillian M. Christensen told FoxNews.com the department “will respond to the senators’ request directly and not through the press.”

“More than 100 Congressional committees, subcommittees, caucuses, commissions and groups exercise oversight and ensure accountability of DHS and we work closely with them on a daily basis. We’ve received unprecedented requests from a number of senators and representatives for physical paper files for more than 700 aliens,” she said, adding that officials have to review each page manually for privacy and other issues.

Cruz ran unsuccessfully this year for the Republican presidential nomination. Sessions, an ardent critic of the administration’s immigration policies, is supporting presumptive GOP nominee Trump.

The allegations detailed in the subcommittee’s research pertain to a range of cases, involving suspects caught traveling or trying to travel overseas to fight, as well as suspects ensnared in controversial sting operations which civil-liberties groups including the ACLU have criticized.

In a 2014 report, Human Rights Watch said nearly half of the federal counterterror convictions at the time came from “informant-based cases,” many of them sting operations where the informants played a role in the plot.

The report said: “In some cases the Federal Bureau of Investigation may have created terrorists out of law-abiding individuals by conducting sting operations that facilitated or invented the target’s willingness to act.”

But even in some of those cases, federal agents got involved after learning of a serious suspected plot. In the case of the Seattle suspect, Abu Khalid Abdul-Latif, authorities said he approached someone in 2011 about attacking a military installation. That citizen alerted law enforcement and worked with them to capture Latif and an accomplice.

Biden admin considering removing Iran's IRGC from terror list as part of Iran deal talks: sources,"The Biden administration is considering removing the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) from the Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) as Iran and the West try to restore a nuclear deal, two sources familiar with the deliberations told Fox News.

Axios first reported that the administration is considering removing the military force from the FTO in return for a commitment from Iran to de-escalate in the region. The sources told Fox that such a move is under consideration but no decision has yet been made.

IRANIAN DISSIDENTS WARN THAT REMOVING IRGC'S TERROR DESIGNATION WILL LEAD TO ‘TERRORISM AND MAYHEM’

The designation was put onto the IRGC during the Trump administration, and Iran has continually called for it to be removed as part of the negotiations. Such a move would be controversial given the IRGC’s high profile role in destabilizing the region via proxies. Talks have been ongoing for weeks in Vienna to bring Iran back into the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), from which both the U.S. and Iran had left.

The FTO designation was put in place by the Trump administration in 2019 after it left the deal a year earlier. The administration also launched a strike to take out IRGC’s Gen. Qassem Soleimani, who headed up its paramilitary Quds Forces.

A senior administration official told Fox on Wednesday: ""We don’t have a deal yet, and we’re not going to discuss anonymous speculation. We’re consulting with allies and partners, including Israel as we negotiate.""

The official said that President Biden ""will make a decision on whether to re-enter the deal based on what’s in the best interest of American security.""

""And let’s be clear – President [Donald] Trump’s approach has been a clear failure and made the U.S., Israel, and our other partners in the region less safe. Not only has Iran’s nuclear program advanced dramatically, but their behavior in the region and beyond has gotten more aggressive,"" the official said.

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said that the U.S. is still in negotiations, ""so I’m not going to speculate or outline from here what the final details look like.""

BIPARTISAN HOUSE GROUP ‘HIGHLY CONCERNED’ ABOUT POTENTIAL IRAN DEAL, CALLS ON BIDEN FOR ANSWERS

A bipartisan group of 21 House members, including 11 Democrats, recently wrote to President Biden expressing concern about the deal, including taking the IRGC off the FTO.

""Among other issues, we are highly concerned about reports indicating the potential lifting of the Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) designation of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and of the sanctions placed on members of the office of the Supreme Leader,"" the letter said.

On Wednesday, House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Mike Turner, R-Ohio, expressed concern about the potential move.

""The IRGC has represented nothing more than a destabilizing presence in the Middle East,"" Turner said. ""News that the Biden Administration is considering removing the IRGC from the Foreign Terrorist Organizations list is unsettling. We must remain vigilant in protecting our nation and allies, like Israel, from growing and potential threats – this certainly will not be accomplished by stripping the IRGC of this designation and could impact the ability of our government to stop bad actors.""

Iranian resistance groups have also warned against such a move. The National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) issued a report last week saying that such a move would ""no doubt heighten terrorism and mayhem in the region.""

The report outlined the IRGC’s work in military and terrorist operations in other countries in the region, via proxies, and the training of foreign mercenaries in places like Yemen, Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. It also pointed to allegations the IRGC funded Hamas, and also looked to organize assassination attempts on U.S. soil.

Each of the groups is now considered defunct, and Secretary of State Tony Blinken notified Congress of the removals on Friday, according to a copy of the document independently obtained by Fox News Digital.

The groups include Basque Fatherland and Liberty, also known as ETA; Aum Shinrikyo, a Japanese doomsday cult; Kahane Kach, a radical Orthodox Jewish group, as well as two Islamic groups, the Mujahideen Shura Council in the Environs of Jerusalem, and Gama'a al-Islamiyya, according to the notification.

DEMOCRATS BAND TOGETHER TO RAISE CONCERNS WITH IRAN NUKE DEAL REVIVAL: 'WE CAN'T STAY QUIET'

The removal comes as the Biden administration faces criticism for considering the removal of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) from the blacklist as part of nuclear deal negotiations.

""The Biden administration dragged out briefings about this for months, then went radio silent, then quietly rushed it through hoping no one would notice until it was a done deal,"" a senior Republican congressional aide familiar with the notification told Fox Digital of Friday's move. ""Republicans on the Hill believe this was a dress rehearsal for trying to remove terrorism sanctions on the IRGC.""

BIDEN WARNED BY IRANIAN AMERICAN SCIENTISTS, SCHOLARS OVER PERILS OF REMOVING TERROR STATUS

Border Patrol agents nab a dozen people on terror watchlist at southern border in August,"Border Patrol stopped a dozen individuals whose names are on the FBI’s Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) in August, bringing the total for the fiscal year to a number that is triple the previous five fiscal years combined – as agents deal with a historic migrant surge at the border.

New data released by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) this week show that there were 12 individuals encountered by Border Patrol between ports of entry at the border whose names matched on the TSDB – which contains information about the identities of those who are known or ""reasonably suspected"" of being involved in terrorist activities.

August’s apprehensions bring the total for FY 22 to 78 so far, with two months still to go in the fiscal year. That is triple the prior five years combined. There were two arrests in FY17, six in FY18, zero in FY 19, three in FY20 and 15 in FY21.

SOUTHERN BORDER MIGRANT ENCOUNTERS ROSE TO OVER 200,000 IN AUGUST AS NUMBERS FROM VENEZUELA, CUBA SPIKE

While that is just a small percentage of the hundreds of thousands of migrants who hit the border each month, and it shows those who have been successfully caught by Border Patrol agents, it also does not include those who may have been among the over 500,000 gotaways – illegal immigrants who slipped past Border Patrol agents – this fiscal year.

Republicans have pointed to the numbers to show the potential national security threat at the border and the need for greater border security. Republicans on the House Homeland Security Committee had pushed for the numbers to again be made public before the Biden administration eventually started putting them on the CBP website in May.

Meanwhile, there have so far been 342 encounters of known or suspected terrorists by CBP agents at ports of entry along the north and southern borders. Of those, 63 were at the southern border and 279 at the northern border. That is the highest number since FY’19, when there were 538 such encounters.

The latest numbers come as CBP announced there were 203,598 migrant encounters at the southern border in August overall, an increase from the 199,976 encountered in July and lower than the 209,840 encountered in August last year.

Of the 203,598, officials said 157, 921 were unique migrant encounters, with the rest attributed to those who had multiple encounters with officials and had been expelled or deported.

According to the CBP data, encounters with migrants from Mexico and Central America were down for the third month in a row, accounting for just 36% of unique encounters, while 55,333 unique encounters were from the totalitarian regimes of Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua, a 175% increase over last year.

""Failing communist regimes in Venezuela, Nicaragua, and Cuba are driving a new wave of migration across the Western Hemisphere, including the recent increase in encounters at the southwest U.S. border,"" CBP Commissioner Chris Magnus said in a statement on Monday.

Border Patrol arrests of migrants on terror watch list at southern border spike under Biden,"Border Patrol arrests of migrants on the terror watch list at the southern border in Fiscal Year 2022 has already eclipsed prior years – amid a massive migrant wave hitting the border.

In Fiscal Year 2022 there have been 50 arrests of migrants on the Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) at the southern border by Border Patrol between ports of entry.

MIGRANT ENCOUNTERS AT SOUTHERN BORDER HIT NEW RECORD IN MAY, AS NUMBERS KEEP RISING

That’s compared to 15 in FY21, which was up from three in FY20 and zero in FY19. There were six in FY18 and two in FY17 -- meaning that the numbers this year are already higher than the previous five years combined.

Customs and Border Protection (CBP) started posting the numbers online last month, after promising Republicans on the House Homeland Security Committee who had peppered the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) with requests that the number of those encountered who were recorded on the Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) be given to Congress and made public.

CBP had previously stopped publicly posting updates on TSDB encounters at the border shortly after President Biden took office, labeling the information as ""law enforcement sensitive"" -- frustrating lawmakers in the process.

The numbers caught by Border Patrol at the southern border are one part of the total number of encounters at the border in general.

CBP BEGINS REVEALING THE NUMBER OF POSSIBLE TERRORISTS NABBED AT THE BORDER AFTER MONTHS OF GOP PRESSURE

At the ports of entry at the northern and southern borders, there have so far been a total of 192 encounters (142 at the northern border and 50 at the southern border) by CBP’s Office of Field Operations. That’s compared to 157 in FY21, 196 in FY 20, 538 in FY19, 351 in FY 18 and 333 in FY17.

The numbers come as CBP revealed this week that there were 239,416 migrant encounters in May -- which eclipses the 180,597 encountered in May 2021 and the 23,237 encountered in May 2020. It is also higher than the 235,478 encountered in April 2022, which itself set a new record for encounter

A high-level CBP source told Fox News that there have been 440,000 known gotaways since the fiscal year began in October -- with over 50,000 in May alone. Combined with the 400,000 known gotaways since the beginning of FY 2021, that means that more than 800,000 illegal immigrants have gotten past agents since October 2020 -- more than the entire population of Seattle.

The report, detailing CBP enforcement statistics for Fiscal Year 2022, highlighted a number of details of CBP's work, including more than 1.8 million total Border Patrol encounters. Those encounters included the apprehension of a total of 66 people who are on the Terrorist Screening Dataset.

""Encounters of watchlisted individuals at our borders are very uncommon, underscoring the critical work CBP Agents and Officers carry out every day on the frontlines,"" the report said, although statistics show that these encounters have been far more common this year than in years past.

The 66 people caught at the border in Fiscal Year 2022 is more than twice the numbers from the previous five years combined. In 2017, encounters with people on the terror watchlist truly were rare, as they numbered just two. That number jumped to 6 in Fiscal Year 2018, but then went down to three in 2019 and 2020. Fiscal Year 2021 saw a significant uptick, as there were 15 such encounters that year.

US SOUTHERN BORDER SAW NEARLY 200,000 MIGRANT ENCOUNTERS IN JULY AS BORDER CRISIS ROLLS ON

The sharp rise in apprehensions of terror suspects coincides with a significant rise in overall border encounters. Fiscal Year 2022 has already seen 1,822,160 encounters through July, with two months left in the year. This is more than 2021's total of 1,662,167, which itself was more than four times 2020's 405,036.

The situation at the border has become so severe that border states have started taking matters into their own hands.

“The suspect is a Lawful Permanent Resident from Bangladesh who benefited from extended family chain migration,” DHS Press Secretary Tyler Houlton said in a statement.

That prompted White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders to note that President Trump has railed against so-called ""chain migration,"" through which dozens of an immigrant's relatives can enter the U.S. simply because their family member made it.

“The president’s policy has called for an end to chain migration,"" Sanders said. ""If that had been in place, that would have prevented this individual from coming to the United States.”

Trump, in a statement, blamed the attack on America's ""lax immigration system, which allows far too many dangerous, inadequately vetted people to access our country.""

""Today's terror suspect entered our country through extended-family chain migration, which is incompatible with national security,"" the statement read. ""My Executive action to restrict the entry of certain nationals from eight countries, which the Supreme Court recently allowed to take effect, is just one step forward in securing our immigration system. Congress must end chain migration.""

""The terrible harm that this flawed system inflicts on America's security and economy has long been clear. I am determined to improve our immigration system to put our country and our people first,"" the statement continued.

The president has pushed to tighten and reform existing immigration laws with both his State Department and Department of Homeland Security, and been largely responsible for introducing the term chain migration into the national immigration debate.

TRUMP VOWS TO 'END CHAIN MIGRATION,' 'TERMINATE' DIVERSITY VISA PROGRAM IN WAKE OF NYC TERROR ATTACK

Trump ramped up calls to end chain migration after the Halloween terror attack in New York City, by rallying support from Republicans in Congress.

The alleged perpetrator of the Halloween terror attack, Sayfullo Saipov, entered the U.S. through the State Department’s Diversity Immigrant Visa Program. The president, along with some congressional Republicans, have called for the repeal of that program.

""We have now seen two terrorist attacks in New York City in less than two months that were carried out by people who came here as the result of our failed immigration policies that do not serve the national interest—the diversity lottery and chain migration,"" Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement Monday. ""It is a failure of logic and sound policy not to adopt a merit-based immigration system.""",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/chain-migration-responsible-for-nyc-terror-suspects-entry-white-house,N/A
"DHS won't provide info on terror plots until Congress gets waivers from accused non-citizens, Republicans say","EXCLUSIVE: Republicans on the House Homeland Security Committee want answers about a new Department of Homeland Security policy that lawmakers say requires them to get privacy release waivers from criminal non-citizens accused of terror and assassination plots, in order for DHS to give them information about the threats.

In a letter to DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, obtained by Fox News Digital, Republicans on the committee say the agency ""has implemented a new policy requiring Members of Congress to obtain signed privacy release waivers from criminal non-U.S. citizens, including those illegally in the United States, and submit that waiver to the Department before the Department will provide the Committee with general information about the threats posed by such individuals.""

They say the policy was communicated to them after they requested briefings about two alleged plots. The first was an alleged ISIS-inspired plot to assassinate former President George W. Bush, and the second an alleged July 4 mass shooting plot by two illegal immigrants.

""It is unconscionable that DHS would implement or maintain any policy or practice to directly or indirectly inhibit Congress’s ability to conduct timely, highly relevant oversight that may require legislative action,"" the letter by Reps. John Katko, R-NY, August Pfluger, R-Texas, and Mayra Flores, R-Texas, says.

The Department of Justice announced in May that an Iraqi citizen, Shihab Ahmed Shihab Shihab, living in Columbus, Ohio has been charged with aiding and abetting a plot to kill former President George W. Bush.

The agency said that the suspect originally came to the United States in September 2020 on a visitor visa and filed for asylum in March 2021 which is pending review. Shihab is alleged to have exchanged money with other individuals in an attempt to illegally smuggle foreign nationals into the United States and specifically planned to help four Iraqi nationals come into the United States across the southern border to help kill Bush.

Earlier this month, police said they uncovered a plot by two illegal immigrants for a mass shooting at Richmond’s July 4 celebration. One illegal immigrant had previously been deported, while another had overstayed his visa.

""There are clear homeland security implications when non-U.S. citizens enter our country illegally and plot violent crime or terrorist activities against Americans,"" the lawmakers say in their letter. ""We have serious concerns surrounding how these individuals entered into the United States, as well as how long they were permitted to reside in the country while planning their attacks.""

Reps. Katko, Pfluger and Flores argue that they cannot fulfill their constitutional role if they are not given timely information from the department.

""Further, requiring Congress to get permission from accused terrorists and criminals, who are not U.S. citizens, as a prerequisite to receiving information on homeland security threats is both unprecedented and absurd,"" they say.

DHS did not respond to a request for comment on the policy from Fox News Digital.

Republicans on the committee say that this is only a recent policy, as DHS recently briefed the committee on another suspected terrorist who was in the country two weeks before authorities were able to arrest him – no privacy waiver was then needed.

Republicans, both on the committee and elsewhere, have been repeatedly raising security concerns about the crisis at the southern border, where hundreds of thousands of migrants have attempted to enter the U.S. in recent months.

In addition to the more than 1.5 million migrant encounters so far this fiscal year, a high-level CBP source told Fox News last month that there have been 440,000 known gotaways since the fiscal year began in October -- with over 50,000 in May alone.

Customs and Border Protection (CBP) recently began publishing the number of border encounters with migrants on the terror watch list after months of Republican pressure.

FBI Cuts Ties With CAIR Following Terror Financing Trial,"The FBI is severing its once-close ties with the nation's largest Muslim advocacy group, the Council on American-Islamic Relations, amid mounting evidence that it has links to a support network for Hamas.

All local chapters of CAIR have been shunned in the wake of a 15-year FBI investigation that culminated with the conviction in December of Hamas fundraisers at a trial where CAIR itself was listed as an unindicted co-conspirator.

The U.S. government has designated Hamas as a terrorist organization.

An official at the FBI's headquarters in Washington confirmed to FOX News that his office directed FBI field offices across the country to cut ties with local branches of CAIR.

In Oklahoma, FBI officials had worked with CAIR's local branch from its founding in 2007 and attended the fundraising banquet that launched the office. But just over a year later, the local FBI froze all its programs involving CAIR.

FOXNews.com has obtained an Oct. 8, 2008, letter sent by James E. Finch, special agent in charge of Oklahoma City, canceling a session with local Muslim organizations ""as a result of the planned participation by the Oklahoma chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR).""

Click here to read the letter, which was provided by the watchdog group the Investigative Project on Terrorism.

The new policy marks a major shift for the FBI, which has long been close to CAIR. The agency has previously invited CAIR to give training sessions for agents and used it as a liaison with the American Muslim community.

CAIR's executive director, Nihad Awad, attended a post-Sept. 11 meeting with then-FBI director Robert Mueller, and he met with other top brass as recently as 2006. But that was before Awad was shown to have participated in planning meetings with the Holy Land Foundation, five officials of which were convicted in December of funneling $12.4 million to Hamas.

Prosecutors identified CAIR's chairman emeritus, Omar Ahmad, as an unindicted co-conspirator in that trial, and Special Agent Lara Burns testified that CAIR was a front group for radical organizations operating in the U.S.

CAIR denies that it conspired in the case and has sued unsuccessfully to have its name removed from the list of co-conspirators. It also is protesting the FBI's decision to sever relations.

""This is an unfortunate legacy of the Bush administration's misguided and counterproductive efforts to marginalize mainstream American Muslim organizations,"" CAIR's national office said in a statement to FOXNews.com.

""It is not surprising that we would be singled out by those in the previous administration who sought to prevent us from defending the civil rights of American Muslims.""

But not all CAIR branches have been told of the FBI's new policy.

""Locally we have not had any reports, we have no letters from the FBI to suggest that"" ties were being severed, said Ahmed Rehab, a spokesman in CAIR's Chicago office. ""It's a working relationship and that remains in place.""

It remains unclear whether CAIR's national office is still in contact with the FBI, as a formal statement from the bureau seemed to hold out the possibility for renewed engagement.

""The FBI has had to limit its formal contact with CAIR field offices until certain issues are addressed by CAIR's national headquarters,"" said FBI spokesman John Miller. ""CAIR's leadership is aware of this. Beyond that, we have no further comment.""

CAIR keeps its headquarters in Washington and runs more than 30 offices in 19 states. But the national outreach programs that it once helped coordinate with the FBI may now be in doubt.

News of the split comes as President Obama has been reaching out to the Muslim community to build closer relations. Obama granted his first television interview as president to Al-Arabiya, an Arabic-language news network based in Dubai, a move widely interpreted as extending an olive branch to Muslims at home and abroad.

CAIR told FOXNews.com that it was hoping for improved ties with the new president. ""We look forward to better relations with the Obama administration,"" the organization's D.C. office said in its statement.

"FBI labeled veteran-led disaster organization a 'terror' group over government criticism, whistleblower says","The FBI was accused of falsely designating a veteran-led emergency prevention organization and its founder as facilitators of domestic terror, according to a whistleblower complaint made public via a letter from the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee.

In the letter, ranking member Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said the FBI associated American Contingency with domestic terrorism despite its own investigation proving otherwise in an effort to ""advance a misleading political agenda.""

""American Contingency is a company founded by former U.S. servicemember Mike Glover, who has publicly rejected the FBI’s accusations that he is a terrorist and has described American Contingency’s charitable work on behalf of communities devastated by natural disasters,"" Jordan said in the letter addressed to FBI Director Christopher Wray.

prev Image 2 of 2

According to the letter, the FBI maintained a terror designation on American Contingency despite thoroughly investigating the organization and its founder.

REP JIM JORDAN: THESE ARE NOT VIOLENT DOMESTIC EXTREMISTS

The FBI investigated Glover’s ""military records, his veteran’s disability rating, and even his monthly disability benefit"" before ultimately determining he was not a perpetrator or instigator of domestic terror. Jordan said these details have been corroborated by an FBI whistleblower.

""We have no comment on any specific groups or individuals. However, the FBI does not and cannot designate domestic terrorist organizations. The FBI can never open an investigation based solely on protected First Amendment activity,"" the bureau responded.

TRUMP BACKER SAYS FBI SHOWED UP AT HER HOME AFTER SHE VOICED SUPPORT ONLINE

""We cannot and do not investigate ideology. We focus on individuals who commit or intend to commit violence and criminal activity that constitutes a federal crime or poses a threat to national security. The FBI’s mission is to protect the American people and uphold the Constitution. One does not come at the expense of the other.""

Jordan said, ""The FBI’s recent characterization of American Contingency as a DVE [domestic violent extremism] organization is striking in light of new whistleblower disclosures that show that the FBI had concluded as recently as 2020 that the group was not a threat.""

next Image 1 of 2

prev Image 2 of 2

Following this investigation, the FBI determined Aug. 26, 2020, that Glover ""is a decorated veteran of the United States"" whose military record and frequent social media posts reflect his ""patriotism for the United States.""

""Glover desires to assist Americans in preparing themselves for catastrophic events and not to overthrow the United States Government,"" the in-line FBI administrative note said. ""A background investigation and review of Glover’s social media failed to support the allegation that Glover is a threat to the United States or its citizens.""

While arguing that the designation was initially unjustified, Jordan highlighted that the FBI kept its terror designation ""even after the FBI determined in 2020 that American Contingency was not a threat.""

Jordan then inquired further into the FBI’s ""Domestic Terrorism Symbols Guide"" on ""Militia Violent Extremists"" (MVEs) — which was publicly shared via Project Veritas — including questions about how and why the FBI pursues people or organizations such as Glover and American Contingency.

The FBI document flags symbols like ""2A,"" an abbreviation for the Right to Bear Arms under the Second Amendment, and ""commonly referenced historical imagery or quotes,"" like the ""Betsy Ross Flag"" and the yellow ""Gadsden Flag"" that states ""Don’t Tread On Me"" as symbols of ""terrorists,"" Jordan said.

Concluding the letter, the top Republican requested from Wray ""all documents and communications referring or relating to the FBI’s Domestic Terrorism Symbols Guide on Militia Violent Extremism, for the period of January 1, 2020, to the present.""

He also asked for ""a full and complete explanation as to why the FBI's Domestic Terrorism Strategic Unit did not include symbols, images, phrases, events, and individuals about left-wing violent extremism of the FBI’s Domestic Terrorism Symbols Guide."" Jordan urged Wray to ""provide this information as soon as possible, but no later than 5:00 p.m. on September 28, 2022.""

The FBI had told reporters last month, ""The threat posed by domestic violent extremists is persistent, evolving and deadly. The FBI’s authority to investigate a case as domestic terrorism requires the existence of a potential criminal federal violation, the unlawful use or threat of force or violence and ideological motivation of any type. We do not investigate ideology.

Iranian illegal immigrant caught at border not on terror watchlist after further vetting: DHS official,"EXCLUSIVE: Texas law enforcement arrested an Iranian illegal immigrant at the southern border last week whose name and date of birth were initially flagged as a match on the FBI’s terror watchlist, but who a DHS official tells Fox News was ultimately determined not to be a match on the database after further vetting.

Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) arrested 29-year-old Alireza Heidari last week after a traffic stop involving a human smuggler at the border in Val Verde County, Texas as part of Operation Lone Star.

Heidari was being smuggled in the vehicle along with four other illegal immigrants. He was located in the trunk. Fox is told that Heidari was handed over to Border Patrol custody and later determined to be a match of the FBI’s Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB).

Fox reached out to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) on Thursday and multiple times since. Only on Tuesday did DHS refer Fox to the FBI, which declined to comment. The FBI’s website says it does not confirm anyone’s status on the watchlist.

However, on Wednesday, a DHS official told Fox News that after further vetting, Homeland Security officials determined that Heidari was not a match on the TSDB.

BORDER PATROL NABBED 17 PEOPLE ON FBI TERROR WATCHLIST AT SOUTHERN BORDER IN DECEMBER

The FBI's TSDB contains information about the identities of those who are ""reasonably suspected"" of being involved in terrorism or related activities. There were 17 people stopped by Border Patrol in December alone whose names matched on the list. That brings the total of individuals arrested at the southern border between ports of entry to 38 since October.

There were 98 terror watchlist arrests in FY22, 15 in FY21 and just three in FY 20 at the southern border caught between ports of entry.

At the ports of entry at the northern and southern borders, meanwhile, CBP’s Office of Field Operations has encountered 125 people on the TSDB so far this fiscal year. In FY 2022 there were 380 apprehensions, 157 in FY21 and 196 in FY20.

NEARLY 300,000 ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS SLIPPED PAST BORDER AGENTS IN LESS THAN FOUR MONTHS: SOURCES

The increase in apprehensions between ports of entry has raised concerns that, amid a historic spike in illegal immigration across the southern border, illegal criminals and terrorists could be slipping by overwhelmed Border Patrol agents.

So far this fiscal year, nearly 300,000 illegal immigrants have evaded Border Patrol, with an average of 2,450 a day in the last 120 days, sources told Fox News last week.

In fiscal 2022, there were nearly 600,000 gotaways. There were 389,155 gotaways at the border in fiscal 2021, and fiscal 2023 is on track to easily outpace those numbers. Last week, agents told Fox News there have been more than 1.2 million gotaways during the Biden administration.

Tom Homan, a former acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) director, told Fox News on Saturday that the number should ""scare the hell out of every American"" and said there was a reason these migrants are not turning themselves in to Border Patrol to be processed and released into the U.S.

""Why would they not take advantage of the program? Because they don't want to be fingerprinted, and there's a reason for that.""

""Have any of the 42 illegal migrants on the terrorist watch list or no-fly list encountered on our southwest border been released into the United States?"" he asked.

Official: Al Qaeda Terror Threat Looking More Like a 'Goose Chase',"A possible Al Qaeda plot to launch an attack during the 10th anniversary weekend of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks is ""looking more and more like a goose chase,"" a senior U.S. official told Fox News on Saturday.

Federal authorities have been questioning all day the credibility of a tip from a previously reliable source that Al Qaeda had planned to attack Washington or New York, putting though both cities on high alert.

But authorities have not been able to corroborate any of the information from the source.

""The threat is looking less and less credible,"" the official said, adding that the entire plot as outlined by the source ""doesn't seem feasible.""

""The time frame doesn't make sense for when these operatives would have been moving into position,"" the official said. ""We are going back to the original source. The president will be briefed on it again in the morning, but people are questioning the credibility of this information at this time. Something is not adding up.""

But officials say they won't rest until they review every last detail.

Word that Al Qaeda had ordered the mission reached U.S. officials midweek. A CIA informant who has proved reliable in the past approached intelligence officials overseas to say that three men of Arab descent -- at least two of whom could be U.S. citizens -- had been ordered by newly minted Al Qaeda leader Ayman al Zawahri to mark the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks Sunday by doing harm on U.S. soil.

According to the intelligence, they were to detonate a car bomb in one of the cities. Should that mission prove impossible, the attackers have been told to simply cause as much destruction as they can.

It's still unclear whether any such individuals even exist, according to U.S. officials.

""We don't have a smoking gun yet,"" Brenda Heck, a top counterterrorism official in the FBI's Washington field office, told Fox News.""It is going to take a little bit to completely flush this out. We certainly -- hour by hour -- we are learning more.""

Earlier Saturday, the head of the FBI's Washington field office, James McJunkin, said he doesn't expect that there will be any problem ""over the anniversary weekend.""

If the the tip had not come on the eve of the 9/11 anniversary, the intelligence community likely would not have acted and alerted the public to this degree, the senior official said.

""We couldn't ignore it,"" the official said. ""But something doesn't add up: the routing, the timing of the assets moving into position.""

Heck said it's ""absolutely possible"" authorities will never know whether the alleged plot was in fact real.

In the meantime, extra security was put in place to protect the people in the two cities that took the brunt of the jetliner attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon a decade ago. It was the worst terror assault in the nation's history, and Al Qaeda has long dreamed of striking again to mark the anniversary. But it could be weeks before the intelligence community can say whether this particular threat is real.

The New York Police Department was paying special attention to the thefts of three vans Sunday, scrutinizing them them to eliminate the possibility of their being tied to a larger threat. One van was stolen from a Jersey City facility, while the other two were stolen last week from a company that does work at the World Trade Center site.

Also Sunday, an explosives detection K9 unit alarmed on a cargo pallet as it was being loaded onto a plane at Dulles International Airport. Authorities evacuated several gates as a precaution, but determined there was nothing harmful about the suspicious boxes.

Briefed on the threat Friday morning, President Obama instructed his security team to take ""all necessary precautions,"" the White House said. Obama still planned to travel to New York on Sunday to mark the 10th anniversary with stops that day at the Pentagon and Shanksville, Pa.

Heck, the FBI counterterrorism official, said the government's response to the latest threat ""has been a little different"" than at other times.

""We have been very open with the public on this,"" she said. ""I think there will be some debate about that after we get through this weekend. [But] I think there's a very positive side to letting the public know a little bit more about what we are doing behind the scenes.""

In particular, she said, by letting the public know about a threat quickly, ""They can help us with what's going on out in the public areas so that we can respond if something is suspicious.""

In fact, Washington Police Chief Cathy Lanier said suspicious reporting has surged by as much as 30 percent, a change that she called ""very reassuring.""

One hundred Afghan evacuees flagged for possible terror ties: report,"An estimated 100 Afghan refugees from Afghanistan to the United States have been flagged for potential ties to terrorist organizations, including the Taliban, according to a new report.

Of more than 30,000 evacuees from Afghanistan to the U.S., about 10,000 needed additional screening as of Friday,"" NBC News reported, citing two sources familiar with evacuation efforts. ""And of those about 100 were flagged for possible ties to the Taliban or terror groups.""

The report stated that two of the flagged Afghans ""raised enough concern for additional review"" and are being sent to Kosovo for further review amid security concerns.

STATE DEPT. WON'T SAY WHAT HAPPENS TO AFGHAN EVACUEES WHO FAIL ‘RIGOROUS’ VETTING PROCESS

""A lot of people were moved very quickly and the intelligence community has been working hard to evaluate whether any of them pose a threat,"" said a senior federal law enforcement official, according to the report. ""Some of the vetting occurs while they are overseas, and some of it occurs here … We are not going to allow people to intentionally be released into the community if they have unresolved derogatory information.""

Other Afghans who fled to America and who raise security concerns will also be sent to Kosovo, according to the sources, who said evaluations are currently underway in the Washington, D.C. area after some evacuees were found to have been previously deported from the U.S. for past criminal offenses.

""The Department of Homeland Security is now deciding what to do with the individuals,"" the report read.

During a briefing on Thursday, State Department spokesperson Ned Price told reporters that anyone who traveled to America from Afghanistan during the evacuation process will ""undergo a rigorous vet,"" yet he refused to provide details on what will be done with those who fail the vetting process.

""Before anyone who is evacuated from Afghanistan comes to this country, they undergo a rigorous vet,"" Price told reporters. ""Unless and until they complete that vet they will not be in a position to come to the U.S.""

The Biden administration has repeatedly said it will honor its commitment to Afghans who worked with U.S. or coalition forces during the 20-year war in Afghanistan by admitting them to the U.S.

Price said the visa vetting should be a quick process because the administration has ""surged"" resources to address the tens of thousands seeking entry into the United States.

""I think the fact that we will have evacuated tens of thousands of at-risk Afghans -- the vast majority of the 124,000 individuals will fall into this category -- I think speaks to our ability to keep our commitment to the individuals who have worked with us,"" Price said.

"Senators sound alarm on terror-related exemptions to US entry for Afghans, warn of 'open-ended' authority","FIRST ON FOX: A coalition of senators is seeking clarification from the Biden administration about what they fear is an ""open-ended"" authority to allow foreign nationals, who have provided ""insignificant material support"" to certain terrorist organizations, to enter the United States.

Ten senators, led by Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., have written to the Departments of Homeland Security and State about the administration’s moves in June to allow Afghan evacuees who have worked as civil servants during Taliban rule, or individuals who have provided ""individuals who provided insignificant or certain limited material support to a designated terrorist organization,"" to be exempted from terror-related U.S.entry restrictions.

""We write because the American people deserve an explanation regarding the broad, open-ended nature of this authority for exempting individuals who would otherwise be barred from immigration to the United States for supporting a terrorist organization,"" they write.

The U.S. has brought in tens of thousands of evacuees from Afghanistan in the wake of the U.S. withdrawal and Taliban takeover last year. As part of that, the administration moved in June to exempt certain Afghans who may be caught up in terrorism-related inadmissibility grounds (TRIG).

DHS ANNOUNCES TERROR BAR EXEMPTIONS FOR AFGHAN EVACUAEES WHO WORKED FOR TALIBAN-ERA CIVIL SERVICE

TRIG places limits on individuals who are members of a terrorist organization or who have engaged in terrorism, making them inadmissible to the U.S. and ineligible for immigration benefits. The USCIS website says that the definition of terrorism-related activity ""is relatively broad and may apply to individuals and activities not commonly thought to be associated with terrorism.""

Both the lawmakers and the Biden administration have noted prior usage of TRIG exemptions including in 2019 to apply for those involved in the Lebanese civil war between 1975 and 1990.

The June exemptions allowed for three situations in which Afghans could be exempt. The first would be for those employed as civil servants in Afghanistan at any time from Sept. 27, 1996 to Dec. 22, 2001 — after the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan in the wake of the 9/11 attacks — and after August 15, 2021. DHS said that could apply to many occupations including teachers, doctors and engineers — and those who used their position to mitigate Taliban repression.

Also potentially exempt are Afghans who ""supported U.S. military interests"" by fighting in resistance movements against the Taliban, as well as Afghans who took part in the conflict against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. It does not apply to those who targeted civilians or U.S. interests, or who committed terror acts or human rights abuses.

Finally, it exempts ""individuals who provided insignificant or certain limited material support to a designated terrorist organization."" DHS gave the examples of paying tolls to pass through checkpoints or paying for utilities or to obtain a passport -- given the ubiquitous presence of the Taliban in Afghan life.

However, while the civil servant exemption specifically applies to Afghan civil servants within certain time periods, the senators argue that the June 8 determination on support for terrorist organizations ""makes no mention of Afghanistan or Afghan refugees and is not limited to the categories of Afghan individuals described in your press release or persons connected with the war in Afghanistan.""

BIDEN ADMIN PLANS TO EXEMPT SOME TALIBAN-ERA AFGHAN CIVIL SERVANTS FROM US TERROR-RELATED ENTRY RESTRICTIONS

""Indeed, it is not limited to certain conflicts, terrorist organizations, geographic regions, or time periods at all,"" they say.

They argue that, as written, the exemption could permit ""the admission of foreign individuals who provided material support to terrorist organizations that the Biden administration deems insignificant or limited.""

""This could include, for example, current or former members of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and IRGC-linked entities, which are responsible for the deaths of hundreds of U.S. service members in Iraq and Afghanistan,"" they say. ""It could include individuals seeking asylum at the southern border.""

Co-signers of the letter include Sens. Rick Scott, R-Fla., Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., Ted Cruz, R-Texas, Marco Rubio, R-Fla., Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, Roger Marshall, R-Kansas, Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., John Hoeven, R-N.D., and Steve Daines, R-Mont.

The lawmakers also ask why the decision, issued in June, was not made months earlier and did not limit itself to those solely from Afghanistan. They argue the decision affects the security of the U.S. and would also make those who provided support, albeit limited, to terrorist organizations eligible for U.S. entry and related benefits.

FBI ‘ACTIVELY’ INVESTIGATING AFGHAN EVACUEES IN US FLAGGED AS SUSPECTED TERRORISTS, SECURITY THREATS: WRAY

""This sort of substantial, inadequately explained change to U.S. immigration policy implicating obvious U.S. national security interests merits further explanation and congressional scrutiny,"" they write.

The senators ask the departments for detailed descriptions of the nationals who the exemptions have been applied to and examples of the support they offered, and also ask whether the determination will or has been applied to IRGC-linked individuals.

They also ask if it has been applied to those seeking entry to the U.S. from Mexico, as well as how the departments define and apply the concept of ""insignificant material support"" in practice.

The administration has defended the use of the exemptions, arguing that it is vital to allow for humanitarian protection for at-risk Afghans.

""Doctors, teachers, engineers, and other Afghans, including those who bravely and loyally supported U.S. forces on the ground in Afghanistan at great risk to their safety, should not be denied humanitarian protection and other immigration benefits due to their inescapable proximity to war or their work as civil servants,"" Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement in June. ""These exemptions will allow eligible individuals who pose no national security or public safety risk to receive asylum, refugee status, or other legal immigration status, demonstrating the United States’ continued commitment to our Afghan allies and their family members.""

The administration has repeatedly stressed that all Afghans undergo multi-layered and ""rigorous"" vetting across multiple databases — and that only those who clear checks can be eligible for an exemption. But Republicans have been raising concern for months about the extent and reliability of such vetting.

FBI Director Christopher Wray told lawmakers this month that the agency is ""actively"" investigating individuals deemed to be national security threats and suspected terrorists who entered the U.S. as part of the evacuation -- after a whistleblower told Republicans that 324 individuals with derogatory information had entered the U.S.

"Terror linked Iran karate team visa denied, will not compete in World Games in Alabama","The Iranian national karate team was denied a visa to enter the U.S. for The World Games in Birmingham, Alabama Fox News Digital can reveal.

Iran's karate team has direct links to the terrorist organization, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC,) and opponents of the regime called for an immediate ban.

After Fox News Digital sent queries to the U.S. State Department and the Department of Homeland Security Sunday, an Iranian regime-controlled media outlet, the Iranian Student News Agency (ISNA) reported on Tuesday that the American government denied visas to the karate team.

A State Department spokesperson said Tuesday that its response has not changed from when first asked by Fox News Digital on Sunday about the karate team and if the U.S. planned to grant visas to the Iranian athletes. The spokesperson noted that ""Visa records are confidential under U.S. law; therefore, we cannot discuss the details of individual visa cases.""

ON GOLD STAR SPOUSES DAY, A TIME TO REMEMBER, SUPPORT MILITARY FAMILIES

Critics claim the martial arts team is packed with members and supporters of the Iranian regime's terrorist organizations involved in the murder of over 600 American military personnel in the Middle East.

Those voicing concern include a Gold Star family member who lost her brother to an IRGC supported attack, and regime dissidents urged the Biden administration ahead of the announcement today to ban the team from entering the country.

Beverly Wolfer, sister of Major Stuart Adam Wolfer, who was killed in Iraq on April 6, 2008 by an Iranian-backed terror cell, told Fox News Digital: ""Allowing Iranian sports teams to compete in the U.S. legitimizes a terrorist regime by flying its flag and playing its anthem on American soil. Ignoring their chants of ‘Death to America,’ signing a nuclear deal which immunizes the IRGC for damages stemming from their terrorist acts, and enabling their athletes to compete on U.S. soil are slaps in the face to America's Gold Star Families.""

Dina Gielchinsky, an attorney at Osen LLC that represents Wolfer and families of hundreds of American service members killed or injured at the behest of Iran's IRGC, told Fox News Digital, ""The Iranian regime has been responsible for killing and maiming thousands of Americans in Iraq and Afghanistan over the past two decades, and it hasn’t changed.""

She continued, ""Allowing its sports teams to visit the U.S. just serves to legitimize the world’s leading sponsor of terrorism and signal to them and to the world that America is fundamentally unserious about terrorism.""

Sardar Pashaei, the Iranian-American former head coach of Iran’s national Greco-Roman wrestling team, first identified the team members’ links with the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC.)

""We believe that athletes who are part of the Islamic Republic’s system of repression and propaganda should not set foot on American soil. In Iran, they are saying, ‘Death to America and Israel,’ but at the same time they are applying for American visas,"" he told Fox News Digital.

IRAN TO EXECUTE 2ND WRESTLER, SPARKING OUTRAGE FROM US STATE DEPARTMENT

Pashaei and other elite Iranian athletes urged the U.S. government to act swiftly to ban the entry of the karate team.

The captain of the national karate team, Zabihullah Poursheib, told ISNA ""America did not issue visas to travel to this country for various teams, including wrestling, which shows that the Americans involve non-sports and political issues in sports and seek revenge.""

Open source articles, according to Iranian dissident, Pashaei, reveal that Seyyed Hassan Tabatabaei, the head of the Karate Federation, said Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the late head of the IRGC’s Quds Force, was the ""shining sun of karate.""

According to Karate News, an Iran outlet, Tabatabaei praised the performance of the IRGC and the Basij, declaring, ""I always consider myself a member of the Basij, and I hope that there will be more interaction by the [Karate] Federation and the Basij with athletes than in the past.""

The Basij paramilitary volunteer militia is used by the Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei to repress dissent and any protests against the theocratic state.

IRAN EXECUTES WRESTLER NAVID AFKARI DESPITE GLOBAL APPEALS, INCLUDING FROM TRUMP

Pashaei, who manages the United for Navid campaign, which seeks justice regarding the execution of champion wrestler Navid Afkari in 2020, said, ""Members of this [karate] team include supporters of the Revolutionary Guards, the Basij [IRGC militia], and Iranian security forces. Among them, Seyed Hassan Tabatabaei, who has been introduced as the president of the [Iranian] Karate Federation, is one of the official employees of the security department, which is under the supervision of the Revolutionary Guards and is directly assigned by them. Shahram Heravi, who has been introduced as the head coach of the team, is also an official employee of the security department.""

Christopher Holton, director of the State Outreach Center for Security Policy, told Fox News Digital, ""It almost goes without saying that members of the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps should not be granted entry into the United States.

""First and foremost, the IRGC has been designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the U.S. State Department. Among other activities, the IRGC is the wing of the Iranian jihad apparatus tasked with supporting, supplying and training other jihadist terror organizations around the world,"" he said.

Holton said the threat of Iranian terrorism is ever-present because the regime seeks to retaliate against the U.S. for killing the US- and EU-designated terrorist. ""Since the U.S. justifiably took out IRGC General Qassam Soleimani in an airstrike during the Trump administration, the IRGC and Iranian leaders have issued repeated threats of revenge,"" he said.

TRUMP ORDERS ATTACK THAT KILLS IRANIAN GEN. QASSEM SOLEIMANI, OTHER MILITARY OFFICIALS IN BAGHDAD, PENTAGON SAYS

Then-President Donald Trump ordered a drone strike that killed Soleimani in Baghdad in January 2020.

Holton said, ""The IRGC is especially a threat to American security in that they were active during the U.S involvement in Iraq in supplying jihadists with Explosively Formed Penetrator [EFP] improvised explosive devices that killed and wounded hundreds of U.S. military forces.""

Pashaei said the ""IRGC and the Basij are known international terrorist organizations, and the presence of their members, including Seyyed Hassan Tabatabaei and Shahram Heravi, pose a serious security threat to American citizens."" He urged the Department of Homeland Security to bar the entry of the karate team.

In January and February, Fox News Digital reported on Alireza Dabir, the head of the Iran Wrestling Federation, who praised Soleimani and urged the violent destruction of America. After the Fox News reports, the U.S. denied visas to Dabir and others to enter the U.S. for a dual meet with the American national wrestling team in Arlington, Texas. Dabir then canceled the meet.

Heravi, the head coach of Iran’s national karate team, said, ""The enemies [the West] thought that they would breathe a sigh of relief with the assassination of General Soleimani, but Soleimani was not an [isolated] individual, and he founded the Soleimani school in Iran with his ideology, which cannot be destroyed.""

Terror watchlist arrests have exploded at the border under Biden,"Arrests of terror watchlist members skyrocketed at the U.S.-Mexico border from fewer than 10 annually under former President Donald Trump to 98 in 2022 under President Biden.

The spike in arrests looks likely to continue as well, with border authorities already apprehending 38 terror watchlisters in fiscal year 2023, which began October 1. The stat is only the latest border measure to smash records under Biden, who has presided over unprecedented levels of illegal immigration.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data says there were some 36,000 border encounters in February 2020, Biden's first full month in office. Biden's most recent full month in office, December 2022, says 251,000 border encounters.

Those statistics don't tell the full story either, as the CBP has also tracked roughly 1.2 million known ""gotaways"" since Biden entered office. The CBP defines ""gotaways"" as migrants border officials could detect but not apprehend.

BIDEN ADMIN FACING THIRD YEAR OF CRISIS AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER WITH UNCERTAIN IMMIGRATION POLICIES IN 2023

Biden visited the border for the first time in his presidency in early January, but many border agents argued it was too little, too late. The border crisis has drawn even staunch Democrats like New York City Mayor Eric Adams to criticize Biden's handling of the issue.

Adams described the border crisis as a national issue last week and called on Biden and Congress to take action. The Northern governor has been dragged into the immigration fight thanks to bussing policies from Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who has transported thousands of migrants to New York City.

The Republican argues the flow of migrants to powerful Democratic cities like NYC, Chicago and Washington, D.C. is the only way to force Democrats to confront the realities of the border crisis.

Statistics suggest terror organizations are also seeking to take advantage of the border chaos, with terror watchlist apprehensions rising from fewer than 10 annually under former President Donald Trump to 98 in 2022.

The CBP saw an estimated 718,000 border encounters in the first 100 days of fiscal year 2023.

Trump assails 'political correctness' in tweet on terror attacks,"President Trump on Sunday responded to the London terror attack, suggesting political correctness and the London mayor’s soft response are contributing to strikes by radical Islamic terrorists.

Seven people were killed and dozens of others were injured in the two Saturday night attacks on and near the London Bridge. Police are investigating the incidents as terror attacks, but no terror group has yet to claim responsibility.

""We must stop being politically correct and get down to the business of security for our people. If we don't get smart it will only get worse,” Trump tweeted first.

The president has from the start of his successful 2016 presidential campaign argued that the key to stopping global terror strikes is to address radical Islamic teachings and being more vigilant about allowing people into the United States from mostly-Muslim countries that are hotbeds for terror training.

""At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is ""no reason to be alarmed!” Trump also tweeted.

Trump also posted on Twitter about the attacks: “Do you notice we are not having a gun debate right now? That's because they used knives and a truck!”

A spokesperson for Mayor Sadiq Khan said the mayor is “busy working with the police, emergency services and the government"" and ""has more important things to do than respond to Donald Trump's ill-informed tweet.""",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-assails-political-correctness-in-tweet-on-terror-attacks,N/A
Twitter argues before Supreme Court that letting ISIS use platform not the same as aiding and abetting terror,"Does allowing a terrorist organization like ISIS use Twitter make the social media giant liable for terrorist acts that were aided by the use of the platform? That was the question before the U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday, as Twitter and the Department of Justice insisted that it does not.

The case was brought by the family of Nawras Alassaf, one of the 39 people killed in a shooting at the Reina nightclub in Istanbul, Turkey on Jan. 1, 2017. ISIS took responsibility for the attack, and Alassaf's family claim that Twitter and other social media companies should be held responsible for not taking proactive measures to take down ISIS accounts and posts that contributed to terrorism.

The oral arguments focused on the language of the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA), which says that ""liability may be asserted as to any person who aids and abets, by knowingly providing substantial assistance"" to a person who commits an act of international terrorism. The key words that the justices and attorneys took a magnifying glass to were ""knowingly"" and ""substantial.""

On the element of substantiality, Justice Sonia Sotomayor boiled it down: ""You knew that ISIS was using your platform. But on substantiality there’s a question of how much it helped ISIS, which is different from how much you helped them.""

JUSTICES ‘COMPLETELY CONFUSED’ DURING ARGUMENTS IN SECTION 230 CASE AGAINST GOOGLE THAT COULD RESHAPE INTERNET

As for as knowledge, Twitter attorney Seth Waxman appeared to agree with Justice Clarence Thomas that a social media company does not necessarily have to know what or where a specific terror attack would be, just that they would ""have to have a general awareness"" that they were ""assisting in overall illegal or tortious activities.""

Waxman also argued that it is not enough to know that a terrorist organization is using Twitter, because even a terrorist organization can engage in non-criminal activities. They would have to know, he argued, about specific accounts and posts that were contributing to terrorism.

He also argued that when it comes to substantiality, it is not enough to simply provide the same services that it provides to everyone else.

""As a matter of law, a court should conclude …that the failure to do more to remove content in the context of a service that is generally and widely provided to anybody who complies with the policies … does not amount to the knowing provision of substantial assistance,"" Waxman said.

In contrast, he gave a hypothetical where Twitter could be found liable for having more specific knowledge and failing to act.

""If the police chief in Istanbul came to Twitter and said, ‘Look, we’ve been following three accounts, and these people appear to be planning some sort of terrorist act,’ and Twitter basically said, ‘You know, people do lots of things, we’re not going to take these things down, we’re not going to look into it,’ there we would have fairly assumed culpable knowledge that there were in fact accounts that they knew about that were assertedly plausibly being used to do this,"" Waxman said.

Testing Waxman's argument that Twitter should not be liable absent specific knowledge, Justice Elena Kagan gave a hypothetical where Twitter knew that terrorist organizations were recruiting members and enhancing their activities through social media, and decided not to have any policies against it and not to remove any of it. Even in that case, Waxman said, there would not be enough substantial assistance to fall under the statute..

US SUPREME COURT REFUSES TO JOIN ARKANSAS LEGAL FIGHT OVER LAW THAT REQUIRES CONTRACTORS TO NOT BOYCOTT ISRAEL

Justice Amy Coney Barrett challenged Waxman's assertion.

""You know ISIS is using it, you know ISIS is going to be doing bad things, you know ISIS is going to be committing acts of terrorism,"" Barrett said, adding that aiding ISIS ""is aiding the commission of particular acts in the future.""

""How specific must the knowledge be?"" she questioned.

U.S. Deputy Solicitor General Edwin Kneedler took a similar position to Waxman, asserting that JASTA is not broad enough to cover this case. He similarly argued that Twitter engaging in its regular course of business should not be found to be giving substantial assistance, but that this would be different if they were notified that a specific account was about to do something.

On the other side of the case, attorney Eric Schnapper argued that while a business cannot be expected to know about specific acts or know that a random user might engage in terror, but if a known terrorist like Osama bin-Laden wants to use something like a satellite phone that is known to be useful for terrorism, that would be enough. Schnapper went so far as to say that the item would not even have to be used for terror.

Barrett appeared skeptical.

""You couldn't just say he sold him a cell phone and have that be enough,"" Barrett said.

Schnapper agreed it would be better to at least allege that the item was used somehow in connection to terror efforts.

The arguments took place a day after a similar case involving whether Google and YouTube could be held accountable for videos posted by ISIS.

NASA is going through 'seven minutes of terror' to get to Mars,"For NASA, the Monday after Thanksgiving will not be a day to eat leftovers or shop for presents online. Instead, it will be a living nightmare that it will have no control over – it willl undergo ""seven minutes of terror"" to get to Mars.

Six months after it launched, the InSight spacecraft will enter Mars' atmosphere, after having traveled nearly 100 million miles, at supersonic speeds of more than 12,000 mph. If all goes well, it will hit the brakes to get to a soft, safe landing on Mars' red plains. The InSight lander, which cost $828 million, is on schedule to land around 3 p.m. ET on Monday, Nov. 26.

But it's the last few minutes of the spacecraft's journey that has NASA worried.

HOW NASA'S MARS INSIGHT WILL PHONE HOME AFTER ITS DRAMATIC LANDING

""There's a reason engineers call landing on Mars 'seven minutes of terror,'"" said Rob Grover, InSight's entry, descent and landing (EDL) lead, based at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, in a statement on Wednesday. ""We can't joystick the landing, so we have to rely on the commands we pre-program into the spacecraft. We've spent years testing our plans, learning from other Mars landings and studying all the conditions Mars can throw at us. And we're going to stay vigilant till InSight settles into its home in the Elysium Planitia region.""

While the InSight lander is descending, it will be hit with extreme temperatures, speeds and forces. In an attempt to prevent any damage to the craft, NASA chose a ""vanilla ice cream"" landing site, the Elysium Planitia, which is flat and featureless.

""If Elysium Planitia were a salad, it would consist of romaine lettuce and kale - no dressing,"" said InSight principal investigator Bruce Banerdt at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in a separate statement. ""If it were an ice cream, it would be vanilla.""

In addition, the InSight will also autonomously deploy a parachute and ignite its onboard thrusters to help it land safely. Because Mars' atmosphere is significantly thinner than Earth's, everything will need to go right to help it land gently, something that has been difficult to achieve in the past.

""Previous missions haven't gone more than skin-deep at Mars,"" Sue Smrekar, the InSight mission's deputy principal investigator at JPL, said in the statement. ""InSight scientists can't wait to explore the heart of Mars.""

Once it's safely on the surface, that's when the excitement begins, said Lori Glaze, acting director of the Planetary Science Division at NASA Headquarters. ""Once InSight is settled on the Red Planet and its instruments are deployed, it will start collecting valuable information about the structure of Mars' deep interior - information that will help us understand the formation and evolution of all rocky planets, including the one we call home,"" she said.

6 MINUTES OF TERROR: WHAT NASA'S INSIGHT MARS LANDER FACES TO REACH THE RED PLANET

The last lander to be lost on the Red Planet was the Mars Polar Lander. It launched on Jan. 3, 1999 and NASA last made contact with it on Dec. 3, 1999 after it failed to re-establish communication with Earth as it was descending, likely due to a premature termination of the engine prior to hitting the surface.

Project manager Tom Hoffman says by the time they hear anything, the whole thing will be over. The communication lag between Mars and Earth is eight minutes. If all goes well, the lander will spend the next two years digging into Mars and doing other experiments.

""Landing on Mars is hard. It takes skill, focus and years of preparation,"" said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington. ""Keeping in mind our ambitious goal to eventually send humans to the surface of the Moon and then Mars, I know that our incredible science and engineering team - the only in the world to have successfully landed spacecraft on the Martian surface - will do everything they can to successfully land InSight on the Red Planet.""

"FBI, CIA Heads Say Al Qaeda Poses Greatest Terror Threat","Although Al Qaeda has been weakened in the past year and a half, the terror network still poses the greatest terror threat to America and will do anything it can to ""inflict significant casualties"" on the United States, U.S. intelligence chiefs told the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Tuesday.

""Al Qaeda is still dedicated to striking the United States homeland,"" CIA Director George Tenet said in his remarks. ""We place no limitations on our expectations on what Al Qaeda might do to survive.""

""The Al Qaeda terrorist network is clearly the most urgent threat to U.S. interests,"" said FBI Director Robert Mueller. ""The organization maintains the ability and the intent to inflict significant casualties in the United States with little warning.

""We face a long war whose end is difficult to foresee.""

But agency heads also said their agencies are far better prepared to detect and head off attacks than they were before Sept. 11, 2001.

The FBI will do whatever it takes to stay ""one step ahead of our enemies,"" Mueller said.

""Defense intelligence is at war on a global scale and all of our resources -- people and systems -- are completely engaged,"" said Vice Admiral Lowell Jacoby, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency.

The CIA and FBI were slammed by lawmakers from both sides of the aisle after Sept. 11 for not sharing information and for not quickly and effectively analyzing intelligence data that could prevent future attacks.

""While our intelligence agencies and military forces have won some tremendous victories in the past year and a half … there is much, much left to do,"" the panel's new chairman, Republican Sen. Pat Roberts of Kansas, said in his opening remarks. ""This past year has not been an easy one for our intelligence community.""

But Roberts has said he sees signs of improvement after the onslaught of criticism.

""I also want to make clear that our intelligence agencies have, for the most part, reacted to the crises of Sept. 11 in ways that should make all Americans proud,"" Roberts said. ""The [intelligence] community today is a very different place than it was before the attacks upon the Pentagon and the World Trade Center.""

Tenet gave his annual assessments of global threats to national security, which covered a host of issues ranging from Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups to those involving Iraq, North Korea and other countries.

He said last week's heightened security alert was due to increased chatter intelligence sources obtained regarding the United States and the Arabian Peninsula. That information showed that these two regions faced threats of a radiological nature, as well as poisons, during the Hajj.

Tenet stressed that ""the intelligence is not idle chatter … it is the most specific we have seen."" It ""underscores the threat the Al Qaeda network continues to pose to the United States.""

It will take ""years of determined work"" hunting down terrorist groups to ""stamp them out,"" Tenet said, but noted that the United States and its 100 ally countries have detained 3,000 Al Qaeda suspects

""The worldwide rousting of Al Qaeda has definitely disrupted its operations,"" Tenet said.

But he noted that more than 600 people were killed globally in terrorist attacks last year -- 200 of which were Al Qaeda related. Nineteen of those were U.S. citizens.

""We place no limitations on our expectations on what Al Qaeda might do to survive,"" Tenet said.

There are ""disturbing signs"" the terror network has a solid presence in Iran and Iraq, and is taking refuge in Pakistan and Afghanistan, the CIA director said. It's also refining new means of attacks, such as surface-to-air missiles, poisons and underwater missiles to attack underwater targets ""to achieve multiple objectives, striking prominent landmarks, inflicting mass casualties,"" and causing economic strife, he said.

""Al Qaeda is living in the expectation of resuming the offensive,"" Tenet added.

Mueller presented the FBI's first-ever National Terrorist Threat Assessment, a version of which had been completed on Sept. 10, 2001. It has now been rewritten, in part to reflect the FBI's new top priority of preventing terrorism rather than catching criminals.

Mueller said Al Qaeda is viable even though the organization is scattered after losing its refuge in Afghanistan. And there remains a grave threat of chemical, biological or radiological attacks, as well as more conventional bombings and individual acts such as assassinations or kidnappings at home and abroad.

""The Al Qaeda network will remain, for the foreseeable future, the most urgent threat to this country,"" Mueller said, ""but it does not operate in a vacuum,"" since other terrorist groups support it.

The FBI has found that Islamic militants are living here in the Untied States, several hundred of whom are linked to Al Qaeda. Many of these groups focus on fundraising through charities or other means, recruitment and training. One or more groups can be mobilized by Al Qaeda to carry out operations here, Mueller said.

""Finding and rooting out Al Qaeda members once they have entered the United States and have time to establish themselves is our most serious intelligence and law enforcement challenge,"" Mueller said.

Mueller's greatest concern, he said, is that Al Qaeda and other terrorist regimes are trying to obtain biological, chemical or radiological weapons via the Internet. That would be a ""huge morale boost"" for a terror network being weakened every day, he said. But another fear is that terrorist-sponsoring states such as Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Cuba and North Korea would give these groups such weapons, he said.

But the FBI is committed to transforming itself to deal with these new threats, Mueller said.

The agency has boosted its counterterrorism resources and personnel, Mueller said, and has established a College of Analytical Studies -- with the help of the CIA -- to train new intelligence analysts. The FBI has also improved the terrorist threat warning system, set up a threat-monitoring unit to produce daily threat matrix, set up a 24-hour terrorist watch center and has focused resources specifically on operations such as terrorist financing operations.

The FBI is also working more closely with state and local governments to better train law enforcement personnel on the ground.

""I am committed to the closest possible cooperation with the intelligence community and other government agencies, as well as state and local agencies, and I should not leave out our counterparts overseas,"" Mueller said.

Roberts said he and committee Vice Chairman Sen. John D. Rockefeller, D-W.Va., have been visiting some of the nation's 13 intelligence facilities to see for themselves the improvements being made. The two lawmakers are having ""what I call 'meaningful dialogue'"" with intelligence experts, Roberts said.

""So far, I have been … very impressed by these visits,"" he said.

Roberts said that as head of the select intelligence panel, ""I intend to conduct vigorous oversight of the intelligence community,"" and probe issues such as structural reform and intelligence shortfalls. Saying he will take ""a very hard look"" at threats facing this country, Roberts committed to work very closely with the independent commission probing the Sept. 11 attacks.",https://www.foxnews.com/story/fbi-cia-heads-say-al-qaeda-poses-greatest-terror-threat,N/A
FBI: Eco-Terrorism Remains No. 1 Domestic Terror Threat,"For nearly seven years, the nation has turned its terror focus on Al Qaeda and the hunt for Usama bin Laden. But there is a domestic terror threat that federal officials still consider priority No. 1 — eco-terrorism.

The torching of luxury homes in the swank Seattle suburb of Woodinville earlier this month served as a reminder that the decades-long war with militant environmentalists on American soil has not ended.

""It remains what we would probably consider the No. 1 domestic terrorism threat, because they have successfully continued to conduct different types of attacks in and around the country,"" said FBI Special Agent Richard Kolko.

The FBI defines eco-terrorism ""as the use or threatened use of violence of a criminal nature against innocent victims or property by an environmentally oriented, subnational group for environmental-political reasons, or aimed at an audience beyond the target, often of a symbolic nature.""

For years, officials have battled against members of shadowy groups such as the Earth Liberation Front and its brother-in-arms, the Animal Liberation Front. Law enforcement has made strides prosecuting cells, but it's been unable to end the arsons that have plagued developments encroaching on rural lands in the West.

FBI estimates place damages from these attacks at well over $100 million. So far, no one has been killed.

It's a problem that's unlikely to go away.

""Every time a fire breaks out and somebody takes a spray can and writes 'ELF' or 'ALF' on there, then everybody gets all excited that 'Oh this movement has started back up,'"" said Bob Holland, a retired arson investigator. ""The movement never really left.""

Fighting for Nature

The Earth Liberation Front rose to infamy in the late 1990s for a series of arsons in the Pacific Northwest targeting industries, such as logging, that the eco-terrorists perceived as a threat to nature.

""Generally speaking, the Earth Liberation folks are motivated by a deep kind of affective connection to nature that many of them would characterize as spiritual or religious,"" said Bron Taylor, a professor of religion and nature at the University of Florida. ""They believe that the human species is perpetrating a war on nature and that those who are connected to nature and belong to it have a right to defend themselves.""

Members who carry out attacks in the name of nature tend to be of college age and well educated, and typically have an out-of-town recruiter who lures them into the act of crime, said Ron Arnold, the executive vice president of the Center for the Defense of Free Enterprise.

There are exceptions to the rule, Kolko said. Some members are in their 30s, 40s and 50s.

These eco-terrorists often operate alone or in small groups, making them extremely difficult to penetrate. They target structures they feel are infringing on nature, leaving low-tech detonators that allow the fires to start after they've left.

In 2006, a nine-year federal sting dubbed ""Operation Backfire"" was able to dissolve a cell responsible for 20 acts of arson in five Western states over five years.

That cell, dubbed ""The Family,"" caused more than $40 million in damage and included attacks on a meat company in Eugene, Ore., a ski resort in Vail, Colo., and the torching of SUVs in Oregon.

The latest Family member convicted, Briana Waters, was found guilty of arson on March 6 in Tacoma, Wash., for her role as a lookout in a 2001 fire that destroyed the Center for Urban Horticulture in Seattle, causing more than $2 million in damages.

""It's a leaderless ideology that can exist for a long time,"" said Holland, who worked on Operation Backfire. ""You take out a cell like we did in Backfire — that doesn't stop like-minded individuals around the country from perpetuating the ideology of the ELF and ALF movement.""

Elves in the Night

The perpetrators of the March 3 fires on the Seattle Street of Dreams left their mark, investigators said, with signs that read, ""ELF"" and ""McMansions in RCDs r not green,"" a reference to rural cluster developments or residential subdivisions, along with an estimated $7 million in damages.

The homes had been built near the headwaters of Bear Creek, which is home to endangered chinook salmon. Opponents of the development had questioned whether the luxury homes could pollute the creek and an aquifer that is a source of drinking water, and whether enough was done to protect nearby wetlands.

In the past, ELF members have used everything from milk jugs to electrical ignition devices to set their blazes, Holland said.

Officials for the fire earlier this month said no explosive devices were found amid the remains of the houses. The Building Industry Association of Washington and the FBI were offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible.

Finding the culprit in eco-terrorism often requires someone within the organization turning against his or her fellow elves.

""In Operation Backfire, we saw a sophistication that we've never seen in any type of a radical organization, and frankly, if somebody hadn't turned, we wouldn't have enjoyed the success we've had with that,"" Holland said.

Trying to predict where or when they'll strike next becomes a guessing game, experts said.

""You don't know what's the hot topic in the minds of the potential perpetrators today — you can look on the Web and find out all kinds of things,"" Arnold said, noting that ""it's very difficult to generalize because there are so many threads in the tapestry of environmentally inspired crimes.""

The FBI currently has 180 ongoing eco-terror investigations and over the last several years has tied them to some 1,800 criminal acts, Kolko said.

Despite the gains law enforcement has made, it just takes one person to reignite the movement, Holland said.

""There's no way to know or gauge how many people are actually sympathetic to that ideology and will continue to perpetuate it through acts of arson and other violence,"" he said.

Islamberg: A Terror Compound in New York ... or Misunderstood Neighbors?,"Hidden in a remote area off a primitive dirt road lies a mysterious 70-acre compound in which more than 100 Muslims live in seclusion, following the teachings of its founder, a radical cleric with alleged ties to terrorism.

It's neither a Taliban stronghold outside Jalalabad, nor an extremist madrassa on the outskirts of Karachi.

It's a place called Islamberg, a closed and seemingly quiet community at the foot of the Catskill Mountains in upstate New York, about three hours north of Manhattan.

It's also a compound shrouded in local rumors, mystery — and fear — sitting near the huge reservoir system that provides New York City with most of its drinking water.

Quietly nestled in the woods, Islamberg remained unnoticed for the two decades leading up to Sept. 11, 2001, when the World Trade Center and the Pentagon were attacked by a determined band of Islamic extremists.

That’s when people started questioning the community’s ties to a Pakistani cleric allegedly connected to worldwide terrorism. They also started talking about the unusual sounds of gunfire and explosions some said they heard emanating from the compound.

But before you leap to conclusions and head to the Catskills to personally fight the war on terror — you need to know the entire story. The truth, as is often the case, is a lot more complicated than the headlines suggest.

Islamberg got its start about 20 years ago, when — inspired by the words of the Sufi cleric Sheikh Syed Mubarik Ali Shah Gilani — a group of primarily black Muslims from Brooklyn left New York City to escape crime, poverty and racism. Aiming to lead what they believed was a peaceful and holy Muslim life, they built a community of some 40 family houses, their own grocery store and a bookstore.

And they weren't alone. Other groups, also inspired by Gilani, have set up similiar communities in 19 other states. According to the group's own Web site, the Islamberg community is still ""struggling,"" and is asking for donations to complete its mosque.

According to locals, the land previously belonged to a Deposit, N.Y., woman who opened up her home in the in the late 1970s or early '80s to disadvantaged youths from the city so that they could avoid being led astray by a financially and morally bankrupt urban environment.

Those boys, according to locals who were friendly with some of the group, eventually went on to form Islamberg, and at some point they were joined by another group of more militant Muslims, who created something of a rival faction within the community.

The group lived quietly there for years with little interaction with the local communities except for forays into town for supplies or to sell baked goods at the weekly flea market. Some of the men had jobs at a local credit-processing center or working for the Port Authority in New York City (where they are said to maintain a residence near a bridge that runs between two boroughs).

In the few instances when they did have relationships with the locals, they were almost always friendly, many said. Sometimes local children would visit their friends in the compound.

""There was a sense of camaraderie with them,"" one woman said.

There was a notable exception, a situation involving the local schools in the late 1990s when some of the Islamberg boys got into a scuffle with local boys.

""They broke my nephew's nose,"" said a Hancock, N.Y., woman, who asked that her name not be used.

Another man said the Muslim boys ""trashed"" the school in Deposit.

Locals variously blamed the fighting on an angry attitude on the part of the Muslim boys, racism on the part of the local boys or the ""usual"" relatively trivial events that lead almost all teenage boys into a confrontation at one point or another in their lives.

According to Joy Felber, 62, a retired taxidermist who's lived in Deposit for 19 years, the cause lay with a group of local boys who picked a fight with the Muslims.

""We had some young boys in town who were causing trouble — not from the Muslim community — but they were antagonizing the boys in the Muslim community,"" Felber said. ""It was lack of knowledge. When people don't know other people, they have a tendency to lash out. And you put two teenage boys together and sparks fly.""

After a further controversy about whether the Islamberg boys should have been going to public school in Deposit or Hancock (the compound lies on the border between the two towns, and even longtime residents differ on whether it's technically in Deposit, Hancock or nearby Tompkins), the boys were pulled from the schools and the Muslim community drew away from town life.

All Islamberg children are now schooled on the compound in a school that, according to one report, has a total of 62 students.

And then Sept. 11, 2001 happened. Anti-Muslim sentiment soared throughout the United States, and in the case of the Islamberg compound, concern grew among their neighbors.

Sheikh Syed Mubarik Ali Shah Gilani, the Pakistani Sufi cleric whom the Islamberg residents call their spiritual leader, has long been suspected of being one of the founders of a group called Jamaat al-Fuqra, a group that the U.S. and Pakistan say is responsible for a long list of terrorist activities around the world, including murders of rival religious figures in the U.S.

Gilani also was the man American reporter Daniel Pearl was going to see when he was abducted and murdered.

Gilani has denied any connection with either Pearl's death or with Jamaat al-Fuqra.

The possible connection between Islamberg and extremist Islamic terrorism wasn't lost on authorities.

""We've had files on them for years,"" said Sgt. William Vymislicky of the New York State Police.

FBI Special Agent Richard Kolko said that he could neither confirm nor deny any current investigations, but that the bureau follows up on every reported case of possible terrorist activities.

And, according to some locals, the Islamberg community has given them plenty of reason to be wary. If you visit the compound's entry gate, you will be stopped at a guard shack by men armed with guns. And some say that you sometimes can hear gunfire or even explosions coming from the area.

""You'd better be careful if you go up there,"" several locals said. ""They have guns.""

After Sept. 11, local rumors about the compound ran rampant, from the plausible to the patently ludicrous: The compound trained terrorists for combat; there was a tank buried somewhere on the grounds; Usama bin Laden had gone into hiding in the compound.

A series of articles about Islamberg in newspapers and on the Internet further fueled the flames, and people started to focus more closely on the work the men did on New York City's bridges and tunnels, and how close the compound was to a major reservoir.

But other local residents say fears about Islamberg are unfounded. The region is a hunter's paradise, practice shooting is a nearly universal hobby in the area, and the sounds of explosions most likely come from a very nearby quarry.

""I live up on Columbia Lake and I hear gunshots all the time, and it's not from the Muslim community,"" Felber said. ""I always hear people practicing and shooting their guns and stuff.""

Of those locals who expressed fears about Islamberg, almost none of them said they had ever actually had any substantial interaction with anyone from the compound.

And though the community is noticeably less friendly that it once was, some say that it still welcomes those who make an effort to be sympathetic.

The doctor at the local clinic in Deposit, John Giannone, now fasts on Ramadan out of respect for the community's beliefs and has maintained a relatively close relationship with the group. When his house was devastated by flooding that nearly wiped Deposit off the map in June 2006, volunteers from Islamberg came down and helped him clear out the debris and clean up the rental home his family had moved into. Giannone says they even did the dishes.

That flood was one occasion when Islamberg shone, according to many. According to several accounts, Islamberg men, women, boys and girls pitched in and helped clear debris, clean people's basements, distribute food and maintain the emergency shelter where residents gathered. On July 4, the Muslims joined the rest of the community for a dinner to commemorate their shared adversity.

""We were all just overwhelmed, and I remember the thanksgiving prayer that was said to bless everyone, no matter who you are and to bring the community together. And in that moment, we were a community, we were together as one,"" Felber said. ""I couldn't see a person that was going to be part of a terrorist group standing in a food line of thanksgiving there serving the community.""

But plenty of questions remain:

How close is Islamberg to Gilani?

How does it accept, reject or interpret the portions of his writings that espouse violence?

Does the community send people overseas or to other camps for training? And, if it does, exacly what kind of training?

How does the group see its relationship to the local community, and does it plan to do anything to improve it?

Islamberg's elders refused a request to visit with them and tour the compound, citing a recent spate of negative publicity. For now, it remains an enigma in the mountains.",https://www.foxnews.com/story/islamberg-a-terror-compound-in-new-york-or-misunderstood-neighbors,N/A
Sandy Berger Probed Over Terror Memos,"Former President Clinton's national security adviser is under criminal investigation for taking highly classified terrorism documents that should have been turned over to the independent commission probing the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, FOX News has confirmed.

Sandy Berger (search) is under scrutiny by the Justice Department (search) following the disappearance of documents he was reviewing at the National Archives.

Berger's home and office were searched earlier this year by FBI (search) agents armed with warrants after the former Clinton adviser voluntarily returned some sensitive documents to the National Archives (search) and admitted he also removed handwritten notes he had made while reviewing the sensitive documents.

However, some drafts of a sensitive after-action report on the Clinton administration's handling of Al Qaeda terror threats during the December 1999 millennium celebration are still missing, officials and lawyers said. Officials said the missing documents also identified America's terror vulnerabilities at airports to seaports.

• Click to read Berger's testimony before the Sept. 11 commission (pdf file).

Berger and his lawyer said Monday night he knowingly removed the handwritten notes by placing them in his jacket, pants and socks, and also inadvertently took copies of actual classified documents in a leather portfolio.

""I deeply regret the sloppiness involved, but I had no intention of withholding documents from the commission, and to the contrary, to my knowledge, every document requested by the commission from the Clinton administration was produced,"" Berger said in a statement.

There are laws strictly governing the handling of classified information, including prohibiting unauthorized removal or release of such information.

Lanny Breuer, one of Berger's attorneys, said his client had offered to cooperate fully with the investigation but had not yet been interviewed by the FBI or prosecutors.

Berger served as Clinton's national security adviser for all of the president's second term and most recently has been informally advising Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry. Clinton asked Berger last year to review and select the administration documents that would be turned over to the Sept. 11 commission.

Late Tuesday, Berger announced that he would no longer aid Kerry's presidential bid, saying he didn't want to diminish the work of the Sept. 11 commission.

""Mr. Berger does not want any issue surrounding the 9/11 commission to be used for partisan purposes. With that in mind he has decided to step aside as an informal adviser to the Kerry campaign until this matter is resolved,"" Breuer said.

Deputy Attorney General James Comey told reporters Tuesday he could not comment on the Berger investigation but did address the general issue of mishandling classified documents.

""As a general matter, we take issues of classified information very seriously,"" Comey said in response to a reporter's question about the Berger bind, adding that the department has prosecuted and sought administrative sanctions against people for mishandling classified information.

""It's our lifeblood, those secrets,"" Comey continued. ""It's against the law for anyone to intentionally mishandle classified documents either by taking it to give to somebody else or by mishandling it in a way that is outside the government regulations.""

'Inadvertent' Action?

The FBI searches of Berger's home and office occurred after National Archives employees said they believed they witnessed Berger placing documents in his clothing while reviewing sensitive Clinton administration papers and that some documents were missing.

Berger said he returned some classified documents that he found in his office and all of the handwritten notes he had taken from the secure room, but could not locate two or three copies of the millennium terror report.

""In the course of reviewing over several days thousands of pages of documents on behalf of the Clinton administration in connection with requests by the Sept. 11 commission, I inadvertently took a few documents from the Archives,"" Berger said.

""When I was informed by the Archives that there were documents missing, I immediately returned everything I had except for a few documents that I apparently had accidentally discarded.""

Breuer said Berger believed he was looking at copies of the classified documents, not originals.

Government and congressional officials said no decision has been made on whether Berger should face criminal charges.

Although lawmakers didn't want to make a judgment call on Berger's fate until all the facts are known, they agreed that the situation doesn't look good for Berger, or even for Kerry.

""There's an ethic here -- that is of strict discipline, of not letting the fact you're working on a political campaign start to color your actions when it comes to national security,"" Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., told FOX News on Tuesday.

Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., called the news ""surprising"" and said that ""unless we learn otherwise, I have to assume that what Sandy said was right -- that any removal of documents was inadvertent. But it is serious.""

Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., said, ""we need more information -- obviously the timing of it is not good"" for Kerry.

""From now on, until the election, everything like this will have a spotlight put on it, examined very carefully,"" Lott continued.

More 'Innocent Than It Looks?'

David Gergen, who was an adviser to Clinton and worked with Berger for a time in the White House, said Tuesday, ""I think it's more innocent than it looks.""

""I have known Sandy Berger for a long time,"" Gergen said in a television interview. ""He would never do anything to compromise the security of the United States."" Gergen said he thought that ""it is suspicious"" that word of the investigation of Berger would emerge just as the Sept. 11 commission is about to release its report, since ""this investigation started months ago.""

Berger testified publicly at one of the commission's hearings about the Clinton administration's approach to fighting terrorism.

Berger had ordered his counterterrorism adviser, Richard Clarke, in early 2000 to write the after-action report and has publicly spoken about how the review brought to the forefront the realization that Al Qaeda had reached America's shores and required more attention.

The missing documents involve two or three draft versions of the report as it was being refined by the Clinton administration. The Archives is believed to have copies of some of the missing documents.

In the FBI search of his office, Berger also was found in possession of a small number of classified note cards containing his handwritten notes from the Middle East peace talks during the 1990s, but those are not a focal point of the current criminal probe, according to officials and lawyers.

Breuer said the Archives staff first raised concerns with Berger during an Oct. 2 review of documents that at least one copy of the post-millennium report he had reviewed earlier was missing. Berger was given a second copy that day, Breuer said.

Officials said Archive staff specially marked the documents and when the new copy and others disappeared, Archive officials called Clinton attorney Bruce Lindsey.

Berger immediately returned all the notes he had taken, and conducted a search and located two copies of the classified documents on a messy desk in his office, Breuer said. An Archives official came to Berger's home to collect those documents but Berger couldn't locate the other missing copies, the lawyer said.

Breuer said Berger was allowed to take handwritten notes but also knew that taking his own notes out of the secure reading room was a ""technical violation of Archive procedures, but it is not all clear to us this represents a violation of the law.""

Justice officials have informed the Sept. 11 commission of the Berger incident and the nature of the documents in case commissioners had any concerns, officials said. The commission is expected to release its final report on Thursday.

"Facebook, Google, Twitter sued by family of American killed in Nice terror attack","A Texas woman whose husband and son were killed last summer in the Bastille Day terror attack in Nice, France, is suing Google, Facebook and Twitter, alleging the tech giants played a role in “aiding and abetting” and providing “material support” to the terrorist.

Sean Copeland, 51, and his 11-year-old son Brodie were among the more than 80 people killed when a truck, whose driver was linked to Islamic State (ISIS), smashed through a crowd of people gathered last July for the Bastille Day fireworks along a popular promenade. The father and son were in Europe on vacation with Sean’s wife, Kim, and his two other children from a previous marriage.

“Kim Copeland is filing this lawsuit hoping that there will be no more funerals where ISIS and others continue to conduct terrorist operations using social media as a tool,” Keith Altman, one of the lawyer’s representing Kim Copeland, told Fox News in an email. “She also wants to see Google, Facebook, and Twitter change their behaviors and act reasonably and responsibly by taking active steps to disrupt ISIS and other nefarious groups’ ability to use their sites to cause death and destruction.”

The complaint, filed Thursday in the northern district of California, argues that the three Silicon Valley-based companies “have knowingly and recklessly provided the terrorist group ISIS with accounts to use its social networks as a tool for spreading extremist propaganda, raising funds, and attracting new recruits.”

“Without Defendants Twitter, Facebook, and Google (YouTube), the explosive growth of ISIS over the last few years into the most feared terrorist group in the world would not have been possible,” the complaint states.

Copeland’s lawsuit is just the latest in a series of legal actions leveled against the three tech companies by Altman on behalf of the families of terror attack victims.

Earlier this month, the family of California man killed in August’s terror attack in Barcelona filled suit against Google, Facebook and Twitter and, in June, Altman brought a case against the companies on behalf of a Jordanian citizen killed in the New Year's Eve terror attack by ISIS at an Istanbul nightclub that left 39 dead.

To date, Altman has leveled seven lawsuits against the three tech giants – alleging that Google, Facebook and Twitter have allowed their social media platforms to be used as a tool to recruit jihadists and that these companies have even profited from advertisements on terrorist propaganda.

Altman and others have begun to argue that social media sites may be violating the provision with their heavily guarded algorithms and that these companies have the resources to monitor any terror activity on their platforms.

“I want to show that there is no social benefit to letting terrorists use social media,” Altman said.",https://www.foxnews.com/tech/facebook-google-twitter-sued-by-family-of-american-killed-in-nice-terror-attack,N/A
135 civil rights groups speak out against Congress' proposed new domestic terror law,"135 civil rights organizations signed an open letter to Congress on Tuesday urging them not to expand terrorism-related authority.

The letter, signed on behalf of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, says that white nationalism and far-right militia violence must be addressed without causing further harm to communities that are already ""disproportionately impacted by the criminal-legal system.""

The signatories noted that the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) already have the resources to go after ""white supremacist violence"" as well as ""hate crimes, organized crime, and violent crimes.""

The solution, they said, is not to create more laws to prosecute domestic terrorism, but to use the laws already on the books more effectively.

""The failure to confront and hold accountable white nationalist violence is not a question of not having appropriate tools to employ, but a failure to use those on hand,"" they said.

BIDEN MAKES APPEAL TO TRUMP SUPPORTERS IN PLEA FOR UNITY

The signatories said that new federal domestic terrorism laws ""would adversely impact civil rights and – as our nation’s long and disturbing history of targeting Black Activists, Muslims, Arabs, and movements for social and racial justice has shown – this new authority could be use to expand racial profiling or be wielded to surveil and investigation communities of color and political opponents in the name of national security.""

The debate over whether to create more laws to combat supposed domestic terrorism in the U.S. comes in the wake of the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riots, in which a pro-Trump mob stormed the capitol to protest the certification of the Electoral College.

Some Democrats have called for a new domestic terrorism bill that would establish new government offices to monitor suspicious activities within the country and combat terrorism, with a specific focus on White nationalists and neo-Nazis.

37 million people displaced by global war on terror: report,"Brown University's ""Costs of War"" project estimated in a new report Tuesday that 37 million people have been displaced in the nearly 20 years since former President George W. Bush declared a ""global war on terror.""

The authors said the figure is ""a very conservative estimate,"" and the number could actually be in the range of 48-59 million.

Iraq has the most displaced people, with 9.2 million who had to flee their homes, according to the study. Millions of citizens in Syria, Afghanistan, Yemen, Somalia, Pakistan, the Philippines and Libya were also displaced.

The number of people displaced by the war on terror exceeds every other conflict since 1900, except for World War II.

ARMY CHIEF RESPONDS TO TRUMP CRITICISM: WAR RECOMMENDATION IS 'LAST RESORT'

""The displacement and other suffering must be central to any analysis of the post-9/11 wars and to any conceivable consideration of the future use of military force by the United States or any other country,"" the authors argue. ""The legitimacy and efficacy of war should be questioned more than ever given nearly two decades of disastrous outcomes.""

A senior Trump administration official told reporters aboard Air Force One Tuesday night to expect an announcement on a partial troop withdrawal from Iraq on Wednesday, and another announcement on Afghanistan in the coming days.

President Trump has routinely promised to bring U.S. troops home from overseas and wind down America's wars. Most recently, he said that he will get America out of these ""crazy endless wars.""

""And it’s one of the reasons the military — I’m not saying the military is in love with me; the soldiers are,"" Trump said at the White House Monday. ""The top people in the Pentagon probably aren’t because they want to do nothing but fight wars so that all of those wonderful companies that make the bombs and make the planes and make everything else stay happy.""

"Chattanooga shooting a 'terror attack,' FBI Director James Comey says","The semantic dance of whether or not to call the July mass shooting in Chattanooga a “terrorist” attack appears to be winding down.

FBI Director James Comey twice called the deadly Chattanooga shooting that killed four Marines and one sailor a “terror attack” during a press conference with NYPD commissioner Bill Bratton on Wednesday. Bratton and Comey spoke after addressing the NYPD Shield Conference in New York City.

“We’ve investigated Chattanooga as a terror attack from the beginning,” Comey said. “The Chattanooga killer was inspired by a foreign terror organization. It’s hard to entangle which particular source…there are lots of competing poisons out there.”

That response came as Comey was asked to clarify an earlier statement in which he linked the root cause of the July 16 rampage by Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez, a naturalized U.S. citizen who was born in Kuwait, to the recent Islamic terrorist attack in San Bernardino.

“San Bernardino, as with Chattanooga, another terror attack we’ve dealt with in recent times…” Comey began the answer to a question about the Dec. 2 terror attack in California.

More On This...

Abdulazeez, 24, was fatally shot by police after opening fire at a military recruiting center and then driving to a reserve center, where he killed five.

Hours after Comey designated the shootings as terrorism, the Secretary of the Navy announced that the victims of those attacks will receive the Purple Heart.

""Although the Purple Heart can never possibly replace this brave Sailor and these brave Marines, it is my hope that as their families and the entire Department of the Navy team continue to mourn their loss, these awards provide some small measure of solace,"" said Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus. ""Their heroism and service to our nation will be remembered always.""

During the five months since the Chattanooga attacks, law enforcement officials and the Obama administration have seemingly had some reluctance to label that act a terrorist deed.

“We’ve investigated Chattanooga as a terror attack from the beginning."" — James Comey, FBI director

Then-U.S. Attorney Bill Killian said Chattanooga was being investigated as an act of “domestic terrorism” during a news conference on the day of the shooting – but he walked back that terminology moments later, saying the investigation would ultimately determine if the rampage was terrorism.

Killian resigned in November to join a national law firm. His last day was Dec. 5.

The following evening, during an address to the nation, President Obama took another step toward defining Chattanooga more clearly.

“As we’ve become better at preventing complex, multifaceted attacks like 9/11, terrorists turned to less complicated acts of violence like the mass shootings that are all too common in our society,” Obama said. “It is this type of attack that we saw at Fort Hood in 2009. In Chattanooga earlier this year. And now in San Bernardino.”

Further clarification could come soon as an updated statement on the attack was expected to come this week, an FBI spokeswoman for the Knoxville office told FoxNews.com on Wednesday.

Feds Issue Terror Watch for the Texas/Mexico Border,"The Department of Homeland Security is alerting Texas authorities to be on the lookout for a suspected member of the Somalia-based Al Shabaab terrorist group who might be attempting to travel to the U.S. through Mexico, a security expert who has seen the memo tells FOXNews.com.

The warning follows an indictment unsealed this month in Texas federal court that accuses a Somali man in Texas of running a “large-scale smuggling enterprise” responsible for bringing hundreds of Somalis from Brazil through South America and eventually across the Mexican border. Many of the illegal immigrants, who court records say were given fake IDs, are alleged to have ties to other now-defunct Somalian terror organizations that have merged with active organizations like Al Shabaab, al-Barakat and Al-Ittihad Al-Islami.

In 2008, the U.S. government designated Al Shabaab a terrorist organization. Al Shabaab has said its priority is to impose Sharia, or Islamic law, on Somalia; the group has aligned itself with Al Qaeda and has made statements about its intent to harm the United States.

In recent years, American Somalis have been recruited by Al Shabaab to travel to Somalia, where they are often radicalized by more extremist or operational anti-American terror groups, which Al Shabaab supports. The recruiters coming through the Mexican border are the ones who could be the most dangerous, according to law enforcement officials.

Security experts tell FOXNews.com that the influx of hundreds of Somalis over the U.S. border who allegedly have ties to suspected terror cells is evidence of a porous and unsecured border being exploited by groups intent on wrecking deadly havoc on American soil.

The DHS alert was issued to police and sheriff’s deputies in Houston, asking them to keep their eyes open for a Somali man named Mohamed Ali who is believed to be in Mexico preparing to make the illegal crossing into Texas. Officials believe Ali has ties to Al Shabaab, a Somali terrorist organization aligned with Al Qaeda, said Joan Neuhaus Schaan, the homeland security and terrorism fellow at Rice University’s Baker Institute, who has seen the alert.

An indictment was unsealed in Texas federal court earlier this month that revealed that a Somali man, Ahmed Muhammed Dhakane, led a human smuggling ring that brought East Africans, including Somalis with ties to terror groups, from Brazil and across the Mexican border and into Texas.

In a separate case, Anthony Joseph Tracy, of Virginia, who admitted to having ties to Al Shabaab, is currently being prosecuted for his alleged role in an international ring that illegally brought more than 200 Somalis across the Mexican border. Prosecutors say Tracy used his Kenya-based travel business as a cover to fraudulently obtain Cuban travel documents for the Somalis. The smuggled Somalis are believed to have spread out across the United States and remain mostly at large, court records show.

Somalis are classified by border and immigration officials as “special interest” — illegal immigrants who get caught trying to cross the Mexican border into the U.S. who come from countries that are considered a high threat to the U.S., Neuhaus Schaan explained.

DHS did not respond to multiple e-mail and phone requests for comment.

In addition to the Somali immigration issue, Mexican smugglers are coaching some Middle Eastern immigrants before they cross the border – schooling them on how to dress and giving them phrases to help them look and sound like Latinos, law enforcement sources told FoxNews.com.

“There have been a number of certain communities that have noticed this, villages in northern Mexico where Middle Easterners try to move into town and learn Spanish,” Neuhaus Schaan said. “People were changing there names from Middle Eastern names to Hispanic names.”

Security experts say the push by illegal immigrants to try to fit in also could be the realization of what officials have feared for years: Latin American drug cartels are helping jihadist groups bring terrorists across the Mexican border.

J. Peter Pham, senior fellow and director of the Africa Project at the National Committee on American Foreign Policy, said that for the past ten years there’s been suspicion by U.S. law enforcement that drug cartels could align with international terrorist organizations to bring would-be-jihadists into the U.S.

That kind of collaboration is already being seen in Africa, said Dr. Walid Phares, director of the Future Terrorism Project at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies.

“Al Qaeda could easily say, “Ok, now we want your help getting these guys into the United States,” Phares said. “Eventually the federal government will pay more attention, but there is a window of time now where they can get anyone they want to get in already.”

Experts also say the DHS alert and recent court case highlights the threat of terrorists penetrating the Mexican/Texas border — and the growing threat of Somali recruitment efforts to bring Americans of Somali descent back to Somalia for jihadist training, creating homegrown terrorists.

Pham says the DHS alert comes too late. “They’re just covering themselves for the fact that DHS has been failing to date to deal effectively with this,” he said. “They’re already here.”

Michael Weinstein, a political science professor at Purdue University and an expert on Somalia, said, “In the past year, it’s become obvious that there’s a spillover into the United States of the transnational revolutionaries in Somalia.”

“It’s something that certainly has to be watched, but I don’t think it’s an imminent threat,” he said. “This has to be put in context with people smuggling — everybody and their brother is getting into the United States through Mexico; I read last week that some Chinese were crossing, it’s just a big market.”

Pham disagrees. “The real danger is ‘something along the lines of jihadist version of ‘find a classmate,’ he said, referring to Al Shabaab’s potential to set up sleeper cells in the U.S. “Most of them rely on personal referral and association. That type of social networking is not beyond their capabilities.”

Pham says the DHS alert is too little, too late.

"Indiana inmates bought keys from jailer, raped and assaulted female prisoners in 'night of terror': lawsuits","A group of female inmates is accusing an Indiana sheriff and corrections officer of enabling ""a night of terror"" in which male prisoners ""purchased"" jailhouse keys, broke into the women’s pods and, in a span of at least two hours, attacked more than two dozen victims.

In two separate federal lawsuits, a total of 28 women allege that David Lowe, a former Clark County corrections officer, sold jail keys to two male prisoners for $1,000. Those men and other inmates then allegedly entered the women’s side of the jail wearing masks made out of towels and blankets. The lawsuit names Clark County Sheriff Jamey Noel, Lowe and additional ""unknown"" officers who were working the night of the attack.

At least two of the victims were raped, according to the lawsuit, including one who suffered physical injuries at the time and contracted genital herpes. Others were groped, sexually assaulted and subjected to male prisoners exposing themselves.

The other rape victim became pregnant as a result and later miscarried, according to William McCall, a lawyer for 20 of victims.

NYC NEUROLOGIST FOUND GUILTY ON 12 COUNTS OF SEXUAL ABUSE

""Since she had been in custody for numerous months, there is no chance she was pregnant before she entered the Clark County Jail,"" he said. ""My client had a miscarriage in December 2021.""

He told Fox News Digital that many of the woman now suffer from PTSD.

""The women that were subjected to the extended period that these male inmates were running rampant in the women’s pod still are suffering great emotional issues,"" he said. ""What is disheartening is the inability of these women to afford therapy and counseling.""

The attackers also warned their victims not to call for help or push emergency alarm buttons in their pods, according to the lawsuit, which alleges that the jailers deprived the victims of their civil rights, inflicted emotional distress and acted negligently.

HOLLYWOOD MOTION PICTURE ACADEMY MEMBER JEFFREY COOPER SENTENCED TO PRISON FOR CHILD MOLESTATION

""On the night of October 23, and into the early morning hours of October 24, 2021, numerous male detainees used the keys obtained from Lowe to enter [women's pods] where they raped, assaulted, harassed, threatened and intimidated the plaintiffs in this lawsuit and other women for several hours, resulting in significant physical and emotional injuries,"" a federal lawsuit reads. ""Amazingly, even though there were surveillance cameras positioned in locations that showed the male detainees accessing the women’s Pods, and even though the incident involved multiple male detainees and dozens of victims over an extended period of time, not a single jail officer on duty that night came to the aid of the Plaintiffs and the other victims.""

As the attack was occurring, according to the lawsuit, security cameras were recording video and audio that should have been available live to the unnamed officers, who failed to intervene.

When they finally arrived, authorities allegedly punished the women by keeping their lights on for three days straight, confiscating personal items and revoking normal privileges.

Lowe allegedly sold the keys to the inmates, according to the lawsuit, but the suit also accuses Sheriff Noel of presiding over ""a systemic failure"" that included lack of training for his jailers, lack of supervision and lack of adequate security.

""These systemic failures allowed numerous male assailants to have free run of the Jail for several hours, resulting in a night of terror,"" the lawsuit reads.

The sheriff’s office and attorneys for Sheriff Noel and the other victims did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

""The [sheriff's office] fired one of its officers, David Lowe, after video surveillance showed him allowing male inmates access to security keys, and after he reportedly admitted [he] 'intentionally placed himself deep into the pod with his back to the door to allow inmates access to the open pod doors,'"" said Stephen Wagner, an attorney for eight of the victims.

Lowe was fired within days of the attack and is facing felony criminal charges in an Indiana court in addition to the federal lawsuit. The criminal trial is set to begin on Nov. 1, court records show – although it’s already been rescheduled multiple times.

ISIS 'Beatle' member sentenced to life in prison for terror beheadings,"One of the men convicted of kidnapping and killing American journalist James Foley, along with three other Americans in Syria, was sentenced to life in prison in a Virginia court Friday.

Alexanda Kotey, who was joined by El Shafee Elsheikh, was sentenced at the federal courthouse in Alexandria, Virginia for crimes he inflicted upon four Americans that ultimately resulted in their deaths.

ISIS 'BEATLE' TRIAL: BRITISH MAN FOUND GUILTY IN US TRIAL

Elsheikh, who was convicted earlier this month and will face sentencing later, was directed by the judge to also be present at the sentencing Friday so that he could hear the impact statements given by family members of his victims.

Kotey and Elsheikh, both of whom are British nationals, were a part of an ISIS cell dubbed ""The Beatles"" by their captives due to their accents.

Ringleader of their group was the infamous Mohammed Emwazi, more commonly known as Jihadi John, who was killed in Syria in 2015.

Foley was beheaded by Islamic State terrorists in Syria in 2014 after being kidnapped and held captive in 2012.

""I pity you both for choosing hate,"" Michael Foley, brother to the American journalist said during his impact statement.

Kotey, 38, is from west London where he converted to Islam before traveling to Syria and serving with ISIS from 2012 to 2015 when he was captured by Kurdish fighters.

The U.S. Justice Department said Kotey participated in the ""seizure, detention and hostage negotiations"" of four Americans, including Foley, Kayla Mueller, Steven Sotloff and Peter Kassig.

Kotey previously pled guilty to eight counts of hostage-taking and terrorism-related counts resulting in death.

6:15 p.m.

The family of a U.S. Army veteran suspected of plotting terror attacks in California says they're surprised by his arrest.

In a statement Monday, the family of Mark Domingo had no further comment about the criminal charges against the 26-year-old. The statement also asked for privacy.

Federal prosecutors said Domingo converted to Islam and wanted retribution for the New Zealand mosque attacks.

The suspect's younger brother, James Domingo, told reporters outside the family's Los Angeles home that he'd hoped Mark's religious conversion would offer him some guidance.

James Domingo declined to say whether he believed his brother was guilty or innocent. He said he would ""wait for the trial.""

Mark Domingo was arrested Friday on a charge of providing material support to terrorists. It's not known if he has an attorney.

Authorities say they thwarted a terror plot targeting white supremacists in California by an Army veteran who converted to Islam and wanted retribution for the New Zealand mosque attacks.

Federal prosecutors said Monday that Mark Domingo was arrested for planning to plant a bomb at a Nazi rally Sunday in Long Beach.

Domingo was arrested Friday on a charge of providing material support to terrorists. The rally never happened.

Court papers say Domingo discussed several types of attacks with an informant that included targeting Jews, churches and police officers.

He said he wanted revenge for attacks on mosques in New Zealand that killed 50 people last month.

"Lawsuit blames Google, Facebook, Twitter for San Bernardino terror attack","A lawsuit filed Wednesday in a California federal court blames Google, Facebook and Twitter for helping to cause the 2015 terror attack in San Bernardino that left 14 dead.

The suit, filed on behalf of the families of three of those killed in the Dec. 2 attack at a Christmas party for country workers, mirrors similar suits filed by the same law firm in cases involving terror attacks in Dallas and Orlando, Fla. The plaintiffs say the social media giants failed to adequately scrub their online properties of messages from ISIS meant to inspire the terror attacks.

“For years, Defendants have knowingly and recklessly provided the terrorist group ISIS with accounts to use its social networks as a tool for spreading extremist propaganda, raising funds, and attracting new recruits,” reads the complaint, filed by attorneys Keith Altman and Theida Salazar.

“Without Defendants Twitter, Facebook, and Google (YouTube), the explosive growth of ISIS over the last few years into the most feared terrorist group in the world would not have been possible,” the suit alleges.

The attorneys represent survivors of Sierra Clayborn, Tin Nguyen and Nicholas Thalasinos, who were among those killed by the husband and wife terrorist duo of Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik. The couple targeted a San Bernardino County Department of Public Health Christmas party in a rented banquet room.

The suit alleges wrongful death, aiding and abetting terror and providing material support to terrorist among other charges.

At the heart of the lawsuit – and similar ones filed by the families of victims of the Orlando nightclub shooting last June and the assassination of five cops in Dallas a month later – is the interpretation of a provision tucked deep inside the Communications Decency Act (CDA) of 1996 called Section 230.

The language of Section 230 states that “No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider."" In layman’s terms, this basically means that sites like Facebook or YouTube are not liable for what their users post on their sites.

Section 230 of the CDA has protected social media sites in the past, but some lawyers and social media experts have begun to argue sites like Facebook may be violating the provision with their heavily-guarded algorithms. Despite these algorithms having come under fire before – from how Facebook curated its Trending Topics to accusations that YouTube was censoring people – these recent lawsuits allege something much more nefarious behind one of the tech world’s most secretive processes.

Facebook and Twitter say they are doing everything they can to prevent terror groups from using their sites, but experts contend the companies are caught between a rock and a hard place when it comes to the issue as the web giants have voiced willingness to aid in the fight but have been less than transparent when it comes to sharing proprietary information like their algorithms.

In a statement to FoxNews.com, a Facebook spokesperson said the company was ""committed to providing a service where people feel safe when using Facebook.

""Our Community Standards make clear that there is no place on Facebook for groups that engage in terrorist activity or for content that expresses support for such activity,"" the statement continued, ""and we take swift action to remove this content when it’s reported to us. We sympathize with the victims and their families.""

In a story about the suit that stemmed from the Dallas attack, a Twitter official emailed FoxNews.com the company’s policy prohibiting the promotion of terrorism.

Google has also said it is working with other social media companies to curb the spread of terrorist content. The effort includes creating a shared industry database of unique digital ""fingerprints"" related to terrorism.",https://www.foxnews.com/us/lawsuit-blames-google-facebook-twitter-for-san-bernardino-terror-attack,N/A
New York man accused of plotting ISIS-inspired terror attack in Queens,"A Queens man was arrested Thursday and accused of plotting a terrorist attack with a knife on behalf of the Islamic State, federal prosecutors announced Friday.

Awais Chudhary, 19, was arraigned in Brooklyn federal court on one count of attempting to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization. U.S. Magistrate Judge James Orenstein ordered Chudhary held without bail.

Prosecutors say Chudhary communicated with undercover FBI agents in text messages, telling them he planned to carry out a stabbing or bombing to kill innocent people in the name of ISIS and wanted to record it to “inspire” others. Chudhary, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in Pakistan, allegedly identified two potential attack locations in Queens: the World’s Fair Marina and a pedestrian bridge over the Grand Central Parkway to the Flushing Bay Promenade

MARYLAND MAN ACCUSED OF PLOTTING ISIS-INSPIRED TERROR ATTACK NEAR DC IS INDICTED.

Chudhary allegedly ordered a tactical knife, a mask, gloves and a cellphone chest-and-head strap so he could record the attack. He was arrested while trying to pick up those items from an online vendor’s retail location.

“Awais Chudhary had accepted the call from ISIS to kill fellow New Yorkers in the city he called home,” NYPD Commissioner James O’Neill said in a statement. “He had carefully planned, conducted reconnaissance, picked a target, and was in the process of obtaining the weapon. All he has left to do was to strike.

""The FBI agents and NYPD detectives of the JTTF [Joint Terrorism Task Force] should be commended for the disruption of this plot. Their work almost certainly saved lives.”

TRIAL OF ALLEGED 9/11 MASTERMIND, FOUR OTHERS SET FOR EARLY 2021

Chudhary allegedly told one undercover agent he wanted to use a knife for the attack “because that’s what he knows,"" but would be open to learning how to build a bomb if the undercover agent could teach him. That done, he would consider using a bomb at a “mini-bridge over a busy road with many cars,” according to the Justice Department.

Chudhary allegedly sent another undercover agent the screenshot of a document titled “Islamic State” that allegedly instructed users where to stab someone and what knives were “ideal.” The document included diagrams with directions on where to stab someone's body, the DOJ said.

Chudhary also scoped out his locations, and FBI agents saw him take cellphone photos and videos at several locations.

“There’s no doubt Chudhary allegedly wanted to make headlines by attacking innocent people going about their daily lives,” said FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge William Sweeney. “Thanks to the diligent work of the agents, analysts and detectives on the FBI New York JTTF, the only thing to report today is his arrest, and the only photos Chudhary will be featured in are the ones taken in our prisoner processing room prior to his arrival in federal prison.""

NY judge orders 'compassionate release' of terror lawyer Lynne Stewart,"A federal judge has ordered the release of Lynne Stewart, a terminally ill former defense lawyer convicted of assisting terrorism.

U.S. District Court Judge John G. Koeltl ordered Stewart's release Tuesday on grounds of compassion after a request from the director of the Bureau of Prisons through the office of U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara. The request said that Stewart was entitled to a compassionate release because she had been diagnosed with a terminal, incurable illness, and given less than 18 months to live.

""The defendant’s terminal medical condition and very limited life expectancy constitute extraordinary and compelling reasons that warrant the requested reduction,"" Judge Koeltl said in his order reducing Stewart's sentence to time served.

Stewart was convicted in 2005 on charges that she smuggled messages from Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman to his followers in Egypt. Stewart had defended Rahman from charges that he conspired to blow up New York City landmarks. Rahman was convicted in 1995. Stewart was sentenced to 10 years in prison, which she had been serving at the Federal Medical Center Carswell, in Fort Worth, Texas.

""It's just really wonderful,"" Stewart said in a telephone interview with the Associated Press. ""I'm very grateful to be free. We've been waiting months and months and months.""

Stewart left the prison late Tuesday with her husband, Ralph Poynter, en route to New York.

""It's a great way to start the new year,"" Poynter said.

Stewart was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2005 and a court filing said that the cancer had spread to her lungs and bones. A previous compassionate-release request was denied in part on the grounds that Stewart had more than 18 months to live, though the judge said he would act promptly if the Federal Bureau of Prisons agreed she had less than 18 months to live and granted a compassionate-release application.

A federal appeals court in 2012 upheld Stewart's 10-year sentence, saying she earned it through serious crimes that she refused to acknowledge. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said it was fair to boost Stewart's sentence from the two years and four months she was given in 2006.

The three-judge panel that had ordered Stewart to be resentenced said it disagreed with her claim that her sentence was ""shockingly high."" It accused her of exhibiting a ""stark inability to understand the seriousness of her crimes.""

NY stockbroker turned ISIS sniper found guilty of aiding terror group,"A former New York stockbroker who became an ISIS sniper was convicted Tuesday of providing support and training to the extremist group on battlefields in Syria and Iraq.

Ruslan Maratovich Asainov, 46, a U.S. citizen and former resident of Bay Ridge, New York, was found guilty on all five counts, including providing and attempting to provide material support to the foreign terrorist organization.

The jury also concluded that his actions caused at least one death, a finding that means he faces the potential of life in prison. His sentencing is set for June 7.

""There is no place in a civilized world for the defendant’s bloody campaign of death and destruction,"" U.S. Attorney Breon Peace for the Eastern District of New York said following the verdict.

NEW YORK COUPLE GETS COMBINED 20 YEARS FOR SUPPORTING ISLAMIC STATE

""As proven at trial, Asainov was a member of ISIS who was so committed to the terrorist organization’s evil cause that he abandoned his young family here in Brooklyn, New York, to make an extraordinary journey to the battlefield in Syria where he became a lethal sniper and trained many others to kill their adversaries, and even after being captured still pledged his allegiance to ISIS’s murderous path,"" Peace said.

Prosecutors have said Asainov traveled to Istanbul, Turkey, in late 2013 and crossed the border into Syria, where he joined the terrorist organization. He rose through the ranks of ISIS and became a sniper trainer, or ""emir,"" overseeing the training of nearly 100 ISIS recruits in the use of weapons.

Asainov had also attempted to recruit another individual to travel from the U.S. to Syria to fight for ISIS, and sought to obtain funds to purchase a scope for his rifle from the same person, prosecutors said.

Asainov was captured in Syria after ISIS’s last stand at Baghouz, near the Syria-Iraq border, in 2019.

NYC bike path terror attack: Jury to start deliberating in trial for Sayfullo Saipov,"Closing arguments wrapped Tuesday in the trial for New York City bike path terror attack suspect Sayfullo Saipov, accused of murdering eight people and injuring many more.

The jury was set to begin deliberating on Wednesday, CBS News reported.

In the three-hour closing argument Tuesday, prosecution said Saipov turned the ""bike path into his battlefield"" on behalf of ISIS, according to the outlet.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Jason Richman said Saipov was smiling when he asked to hang the flag of the Islamic State group in his Manhattan hospital room after the Oct. 31, 2017, attack he carried out with a speeding rental truck. Prosecutors say it was the worst terrorist attack to strike New York since 9/11.

DRAMATIC NEW VIDEO SHOWS MOMENTS BEFORE NYC TRUCK ATTACK DRIVER SAYFULLO SAIPOV IS SHOT BY POLICE

Saipov, 34, steered the truck onto a bike path along the Hudson River and the West Side Highway that is popular with tourists and Manhattan residents, mowing down bike riders.

Federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.

Earlier in the trial, the jury was played shocking video that showed the rental truck barreling toward the bike path at high speed, striking a yellow school bus filled with children.

Richman urged jurors to convict Saipov of all charges in a case that could result in the death penalty. If the jury returns a guilty verdict on all charges after starting deliberations, a penalty phase of the trial will begin a week later. Unless jurors unanimously choose death, the sentence would be life in prison.

Individuals who were injured or lost loved ones at the hands of the Uzbek man were among those who testified during the trial.

""He targeted his victims without mercy,"" Richman said. That night, the prosecutor added, ""he smiled. He was proud. He was happy with what he had done that day. He was happy about the terrorist attack. ... He had done what he came to do.""

Richman said Saipov only stopped his motorized rampage when he struck a small school bus, injuring children. Otherwise, he said, Saipov planned to head to the Brooklyn Bridge and kill as many people as he could there. He was arrested after he pointed black pellet and paintball guns at a police officer, who shot him.

During the trial, defense lawyers haven't contested that Saipov carried out the attack.

But they say he should be acquitted of a racketeering charge because prosecutors were wrong to claim that he carried out the attack so that the Islamic State group would let him become a member.

Defense lawyer David Patton said Saipov was expecting to die in the attack.

""He did not expect to be here before all of you and did not expect to be joining any organization,"" Patton said. And that, he added, means Saipov is not guilty of racketeering.

Patton said that to do something ""as awful"" as what his client did, he had to already consider himself a member of the Islamic State group.

He said Saipov had an ""expectation that he would die by police shooting.""

Saipov, who has been imprisoned without bail since the attack, legally moved to the U.S. from Uzbekistan in 2010. He lived in Ohio and Florida before joining his family in Paterson, New Jersey.

Saipov had no visible reaction to the guilty verdict on Thursday, staring down at the defense table in a courtroom just blocks away from where his rampage ended on Halloween in 2017.

The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York noted that he was convicted of eight counts of murder in aid of racketeering activity and attempting to provide support to a designated foreign terrorist organization.

Din Bajrektarevic, 21, of Old Bridge, New Jersey, was charged with making a terroristic threat in connection to City College of New York, the founding institution of the City University of New York system, in Harlem, according to the New York Police Department.

At approximately 5:43 p.m. on Nov. 23, the evening before Thanksgiving, police received a 911 call from a 22-year-old student, who reported that Bajrektarevic, another student at the school, ""made racially motivated terroristic threats towards him via text message,"" an NYPD spokesperson confirmed to Fox News Digital.

Bajrektarevic was arrested two days later, on Nov. 25.

""The city will go to war you dumb n***** monkeys,"" Bajrektarevic allegedly wrote to the fellow student, adding, ""your brains will be left on the f****** pavement.""

The New York Post, citing court documents and sharing a screenshot of the text message chat, reported that Bajrektarevic also told the complainant, ""Stop talking to white peoples.""

According to the Post, the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office also brought additional charges of second-degree aggravated harassment as a hate crime, first-degree harassment as a hate crime and second-degree aggravated harassment. Yet, none of the offenses – neither those from prosecutors nor police -- are eligible for bail under New York state’s controversial bail reform law.

Bajrektarevic was subsequently released on his own recognizance, the Post reported.

"NYC terror attack leaves 8 dead, several injured; suspect's notes pledged ISIS loyalty","The man accused of plowing into New York pedestrians Tuesday had a printout of an ISIS flag in his car and left behind handwritten notes pledging his loyalty to the Islamic State, as a clearer picture emerged Wednesday morning of Sayfullo Saipov's alleged links to the terror group.

Saipov, 29, is originally from Uzbekistan and is not a U.S. citizen, federal law enforcement sources have confirmed to Fox News.

Saipov had handwritten notes pledging his loyalty to the Islamic State terror network and shouted ""Allahu akbar"" (""God is great"") after the crash, law enforcement officials told Fox News.

Saipov's notes, written in Arabic and pledging loyalty to ISIS, turned up in and near the vehicle, Fox News was told. In addition, the New York Post reported that investigators found ""an image of the ISIS flag inside his vehicle.""

The attack on a bright Halloween afternoon occurred not far from the new World Trade Center building and the site of the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.

Saipov, who was shot by police, was taken into custody and remained hospitalized. Eight people died in the attack and 11 were injured.

The suspect had a green card, a source told Fox News. Saipov came to the U.S. in 2010, and, according to the Associated Press, has a Florida driver's license but was said to be living in Paterson, N.J.

Saipov was an Uber driver who had passed a background check, the company told Fox News. It added that Saipov has now been banned from the app, and Uber has offered assistance to the FBI.

Four of the injured were teachers and students who were riding on a short yellow school bus near Stuyvesant High School when they were hit by the suspect's Home Depot rental truck. One student remained in critical condition.

A victim killed in the attack was a Belgian citizen, Belgian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Affairs Minister Didier Reyners tweeted Tuesday. Three Belgians were also injured.

Others killed in the attack were Argentine citizens, according to Argentina's Foreign Ministry. Argentine newspaper La Nacion reported five of the eight people killed were Argentines traveling in the U.S. on a celebratory vacation.

Those killed, according to the country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, were Hernán Mendoza, Diego Angelini, Alejandro Pagnucco, Ariel Erlij and Hernán Ferruchi.

The attack was being treated as an act of terrorism. At a news conference Tuesday evening, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio called the attack ""an act of terror and a particularly cowardly act of terror aimed at innocent civilians.""

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo described it as a ""lone wolf"" attack, and added that there was no immediate evidence to suggest that there was a wider plot.

Around the globe, cities have been on high alert regarding vehicle attacks. ISIS has been encouraging its followers to mow down people, and Britain, France and Germany have all seen deadly vehicle attacks in recent months and years.

FBI officials confirmed to Fox News that they have agents responding to the situation with the New York Police Department. A bomb squad examined the truck, but found no explosives.

Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Elaine Duke said in a statement that DHS and its law enforcement partners ""remain vigilant and committed to safeguarding the American people.""

Following the attack, President Donald Trump tweeted, ""looks like another attack by a very sick and deranged person. Law enforcement is following this closely. NOT IN THE U.S.A.!""

Trump later tweeted his ""thoughts, condolences and prayers to the victims and families of the New York City terrorist attack. God and your country are with you!""

Police said the truck entered the bike path on West Street a few blocks from the new World Trade Center — the site of the deadliest terror attack in U.S. history — and plowed into several people. The driver jumped out of his rental truck — which police say Saipov rented from a Home Depot in New Jersey around 2 p.m. Tuesday — carrying what turned out to be a paintball gun and a pellet gun.

Video of the attack provided to Fox News by a witness shows the accused suspect running through traffic on the West Side Highway, surrounded by police in the nearby area.

Despite the attack, the city's Halloween Parade went on as planned, with police ""dramatically increasing presence,"" including ""personnel, blocker trucks, long guns etc.,"" according to de Blasio's press secretary. Cuomo and de Blasio both attended the annual event.

"NYC terror attack suspect planned assault for weeks, did prior reconnaissance","The Uzbekistan native accused of killing eight people in New York City had been planning his attack for weeks and did prior reconnaissance before he plowed a rented truck into pedestrians along a popular Manhattan bike path, officials revealed Wednesday.

Sayfullo Saipov, 29, was interviewed by investigators at the hospital after his surgery Wednesday, John Miller, NYPD’s Deputy Commissioner of Intelligence and Counterterrorism, said in a news conference. Miller did not reveal what was said, though reports indicated Saipov bragged about the assault and said he was “proud” of the attack. NYPD Commissioner James O’Neill would not confirm the statement.

Days before Tuesday's assault, ISIS had been encouraging its followers to carry out Halloween attacks with propaganda from the terror group showing a graphic with a blood-splattered machete and Tuesday's date. SITE intelligence group, which monitors terror activity online, also highlighted a recent photo taken by an ISIS supporter near the scene of Tuesday's attack; but it remained unclear if there was a connection between that photo and the rampage.

NYC ATTACK VICTIMS INCLUDE TOURISTS FROM ARGENTINA, BELGIUM

Investigators have uncovered several pieces of evidence linking the “lone wolf” attacker to ISIS. Miller said Saipov, who came to the U.S. in March 2010 through the Diversity Visa Program, had been planning the assault for “a number of weeks,” toured the bike path area and did it “in the name of ISIS.” He also cited the notes left in the truck contained a pledge of allegiance to ISIS. The notes were handwritten and had symbols and Arabic words on them stating: “Islamic State would endure forever.”

He added Saipov followed “almost to a T” the instructions that were put out by ISIS on how to carry out a vehicle attack. Several knives were also recovered from the rental truck, however, Saipov is not believed to have used them during the assault. FBI agents swarmed Saipov’s Paterson, N.J., home and were spotted leaving with several bags of evidence. Officials added that relatives were being interviewed, but would not further comment on it.

ISIS ENCOURAGED HALLOWEEN ASSAULT BEFORE NYC TERROR ATTACK

Two sources told Fox News that Saipov’s name “popped” up in connection with a handful of individuals who were known to law enforcement when investigators ran his name through their databases after Tuesday's attack. It is not clear whether these investigations were limited to the New York City area or included Florida, where Saipov had lived. One source said Saipov had “close ties...[to] the group he rolled with [who] was known to law enforcement.”

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said that Saipov was radicalized in the U.S. and called him a “depraved coward” whose attempt to “instill terror” among New Yorkers failed.

“There was no grand statement that was done. It was an act of a coward,” Cuomo said.

O’Neill said Tuesday’s assault was the worst terror attack in New York City since Sept. 11, 2001. He added “no one in this city is complacent” and urged New Yorkers to stay vigilant in reporting suspicious activity. Cuomo, O'Neill and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio assured that Sunday’s marathon will go on as planned with extra precaution.

TRUMP VOWS TO END NON MERIT-BASE IMMIGRATION, PUNISH 'ANIMALS' WHO COMMIT TERROR

There will be increased police presence at major infrastructures and on the streets as a precaution in the next few days. NYPD Chief Carlos Gomez added New Yorkers should expect more bag checks and additional officers in the subway and major hubs. There will also be more sand trucks — used to create a blockade to prevent vehicle attacks — placed along the marathon route on Sunday.

Saipov allegedly sped down the bike path next to Stuyvesant High School in a rented Home Depot truck late Tuesday afternoon before crashing the vehicle into a school bus. He jumped out, carrying a pellet gun and paintball gun in his hands, and screamed “Allahu akbar” — “God is Great” in Arabic — before NYPD officer Ryan Nash shot him in the stomach. Cuomo called Nash a “hero” for taking down the assailant.

Another 12 people were seriously injured. Three people were released from the hospital on Wednesday. Four remain critically injured and the others are seriously injured. The injuries ranged from bilateral amputation to serious head, body and leg trauma.

Among the eight people killed were five Argentinian men — identified as Aril Erlij, Hernan Diego Mendoza, Diego Enrique Angelini, Alejandro Damian Pagnucco and Hernan Ferruchi — and a woman, Anne Laure Decadt, who was from Belgium. Darren Drake, 32, from New Jersey, and Nicholas Cleves, 23, from New York, were identified as the two American citizens killed.



President Trump on Wednesday called for “Merit Based immigration” after officials revealed Saipov came in through the “Diversity Visa Lottery Program.”

"NYC terror attack suspect, Sayfullo Saipov, entered US through Diversity Visa Program","The alleged ISIS fanatic authorities say was behind Tuesday’s deadly New York City slaughter came to the United States seven years ago from Uzbekistan under the Diversity Visa Program, details of Sayfullo Saipov’s travel to America that could become all the more important as President Trump proposes revisions to his “extreme vetting” program.

The Diversity Visa Program, a State Department program which offers a lottery for people from countries with few immigrants in America, drew the ire of Trump early Wednesday morning.

""The terrorist came into our country through what is called the 'Diversity Visa Lottery Program,' a Chuck Schumer beauty. I want merit based,"" Trump tweeted. ""We are fighting hard for Merit Based immigration, no more Democrat Lottery Systems. We must get MUCH tougher (and smarter).""

The DV program makes up to 50,000 immigrant visas available annually, ""drawn from random selection among all entries to individuals who are from countries with low rates of immigration"" to the U.S., according to the U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services website. Applicants must prove they have a clean criminal record, have a high school diploma or its equivalent, or have at least two years of work experience within the past five years in order to qualify.

The program originated as part of a bill introduced in 1990 by Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., then a member of the House. Schumer’s measure to make a set number of visas available to “diversity immigrants” from certain countries was absorbed into a larger House immigration bill, which was sponsored by Schumer and 31 others, including several Republicans.

The House legislation passed in a bipartisan – but contested – vote, 231-192, while the Senate version containing the “diversity immigrants” part passed more easily, 89-8, and went on to be signed by then-President George H.W. Bush in 1990.

The program has been in the crosshairs of Congress several times, most recently when the Reforming American Immigration for a Strong Economy (RAISE) Act, sponsored by Senator Tom Cotton, R-Ark., called for its elimination. The Trump White House came out in support of the bill, calling the DV program “outdated,” adding that it “serves questionable economic and humanitarian interests.”

Schumer responded to Trump's comments early Wednesday, calling on the president to rescind proposed cuts to ""vital anti-terrorism funding"" in his budget.

“I have always believed and continue to believe that immigration is good for America,"" the senator said in a statement. ""President Trump, instead of politicizing and dividing America, which he always seems to do at times of national tragedy, should be focusing on the real solution - anti-terrorism funding - which he proposed cutting in his most recent budget.""

On Tuesday after the attack, Schumer kept his post-attack comments to praise of the NYPD.

""Thanks NYPD for rapidly responding to tragic situation downtown. Worried & saddened to hear about injuries & loss of life,"" he said on Twitter.

Saipov is accused of killing eight people and injuring 11 others when he drove a rented Home Depot truck down a New York City bike lane, plowing into pedestrians, before slamming into a school bus.

NYC terror suspect Sayfullo Saipov's legal rights,"Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack on Oct. 31, pleaded not guilty during his arraignment in federal court on Tuesday.

Saipov, a 29-year-old legal U.S. resident, was charged with federal terrorism offenses just one day after police said he rammed a rental truck down a popular Manhattan bike path, killing eight people and injuring 12 others. He allegedly pledged his allegiance to ISIS in the aftermath of the attack.

Shortly after the attack, President Trump publicly called for Saipov to be put to death.



From Trump’s calls for the death penalty to other GOP lawmakers’ demand that Saipov be held as an “unlawful enemy combatant,” will he be able to have a fair trial?

“This guy is going to have rights no matter what you call him or where you take him,” Wells Dixon, a senior attorney with the progressive Center for Constitutional Rights, told Fox News.

How does Saipov’s legal status affect his due process rights?

Saipov came to the U.S. seven years ago through the Diversity Visa Program, a State Department initiative that allows citizens of nations with few people in the U.S. to immigrate to America.

But Saipov’s status – whether he’s a lawful resident or natural born citizen – doesn’t matter when it comes to his due process rights, law experts said.

Legal residents “have the same due process rights under the Constitution that citizens would,” Trevor Burrus, a research fellow at the Cato Institute’s Center for Constitutional Studies said.

Burrus noted that non-citizens could, however, be subjected to deportation.

Can he be labeled an enemy combatant?

Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and John McCain, R-Ariz., immediately called for Saipov to be held as an enemy combatant to allow investigators to gather certain intelligence regarding his activities without a lawyer present

“If an individual acts like a terrorist and says they’re a terrorist, they should be treated like a terrorist,” Graham said.

While it’s still possible to apply that designation to Saipov, Burrus said it’s “very unlikely” that he could even meet the definition of an enemy combatant.

Could Saipov be sent to Guantanamo?

Earlier this week, Trump indicated that he was considering sending Saipov to Guantanamo Bay, a naval base in Cuba. He later walked back what would have been an unprecedented move.

“Fundamentally, sending him to Guantanamo is unconstitutional and unnecessary,” Hina Shamsi, director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s national security project, told Fox News. “The federal criminal justice system is fully capable and more capable of fair trials for terrorism suspects.”

Dixon also argued that sending a terrorism suspect to Guantanamo Bay would only provide more fodder for terrorist groups.

“If Senator Graham or Donald Trump are serious about protecting the national security of the United States, they will not hand groups like ISIS a propaganda windfall by sending someone to Guantanamo,” he said.

What about Trump’s calls for the death penalty?

There is a case to be made by Saipov’s defense team that his right to a fair trial has been impeded by Trump’s tweets, Burrus said.

He said Saipov’s legal team could argue that Trump “tainted the entire jury” with his tweets.

“It doesn’t help the government pursuing the death penalty to have the president calling for the death penalty,” Burrus said.

Joshua Dratel, a veteran defense attorney in terrorism cases, told the Associated Press that the tweets should disqualify prosecutors from seeking the death penalty.

""It's inconceivable that it would be fair to seek the death penalty when the president has expressed it twice in a tweet,"" he said. ""It poisons the jurors, all the prospective jurors.""

However, Michael Wildes, a former federal prosecutor, said “even presidents are entitled to First Amendment rights.”

"Pro-Palestinian charity funneled money to Hamas, terror victims allege in lawsuit","A pro-Palestinian charity allegedly funneled money to Hamas, a Palestinian terror group controlling the Gaza strip, terror victims claimed in an unprecedented lawsuit filed this week in Washington, D.C..

U.S. citizens living in Israel and an Israel-based public benefit company, Keren Kayemeth LeIsrael-Jewish National Fund (KKL-JNF), asserted that their lawsuit “exposes a conspiracy and nexus between Education for a Just Peace in the Middle East d/b/a the U.S. Campaign for Palestinian Rights, a U.S. based nonprofit (USCPR), HAMAS and other designated Foreign Terror Organizations (FTO’s) for the ongoing terror emanating from Gaza,” a news release said.

KKL-JNF has been developing the land of Israel and supports Zionist and environmental education, and works to preserve Israel’s natural resources.

UN RELEASES FIRST-EVER REPORT ON ANTI-SEMITISM HIGHLIGHTING UPTICK

“With this lawsuit, we’re exposing the link between organizations masquerading as human rights organizations, but who use donations to advance the campaign of terror against Israel including through BDS [The Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement], perpetrated by terror organizations like HAMAS and supported by U.S. charities,” KKL-JNF world Chairman Daniel Atar said.

The plaintiffs said the lawsuit, filed Wednesday, aims to hold USCPR responsible for conspiring to provide financial aid and other assistance to Hamas and other FTOs that allegedly make up the Boycott National Committee (BNC), which allegedly leads the Boycott Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement. Plaintiffs said the BDS movement is really “a campaign of terror against Israel.”

The lawsuit claims the U.S. Campaign for Palestinian Rights has funneled online donations to the BNC, “the umbrella organization that steers and coordinates the global activities of the BDS movement, knowing that in doing so they are supporting and sponsoring known FTOs,” according to the plaintiffs.

The lawsuit also alleges that the nonprofit has significantly supported the FTOs responsible for the so-called “balloon-bombs” and kites launched from Gaza into Israel, as well as promotes and sponsors the worldwide “Stop the JNF Campaign,” which the lawsuit alleges is specifically designed to harm KKL-JNF.

The lawsuit also aims to bring justice to three American families that have allegedly suffered from exposure to attacks from Gaza.

The lawsuit, titled Keren Kayemeth LeIsrael-Jewish National Fund, et al vs. Education for Just Peace in the Middle East dba US Campaign for Palestinian Rights, is reportedly the first litigation filed related to the launching of “balloon bombs” and kites from Gaza.

Terrorist organizations have reportedly started to use incendiary devices such as “balloon bombs” recently, which the complainants said “wreak havoc on the communities in the Gaza Envelope as well as the environment and ecological infrastructure of KKL-JNF.”

The incendiary devices are responsible for igniting more than 2,155 fires between March 2018 and August 2019, the plaintiffs said, citing research by the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

HAMAS LAUNCHES DOZENS OF ROCKETS INTO ISRAEL IN RETALIATION FOR DEADLY MILITARY OPERATION IN GAZA

More than 8,747 acres of land, including farmland, forests and nature reserves, have reportedly burned, they noted, adding that the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs estimates the damage done by these attacks equate to $35 million, with $15 million directly caused by the fires.

""This landmark case exposes a shocking and multi-layered planned conspiracy and campaign aimed at manipulating the public and hiding the key role played by designated Foreign Terror Organizations in efforts which are cynically designed to appear seemingly grassroots and legitimate, while masking an international terror campaign,” Yifa Segal, who is of counsel to the lead legal team headed by Richard Heideman of Heideman, Nudelman and Kalik, said.

“The public, as well as decision makers worldwide, have the right to the truth and must be made aware of the true identity and agenda of those behind these efforts,” Segal added.

“For far too long, the people of Southern Israel have been traumatized by ongoing terrorist attacks seeking to destroy both their way of life and the surrounding forests and environment,” Heideman said.

He added, “The flow of money is fuel for terror. It is essential to take action against U.S. groups that are complicit partners in funding terror that help enable foreign terror organizations to relentlessly wage a multifaceted campaign of terror against the citizens and lands of the sovereign state of Israel.”

San Bernardino terror attack: Police describe gun battle with terrorist couple,"The husband and wife terrorists in San Bernardino were shot by police more than 40 times combined after their 2015 shooting rampage, according to a new report issued by the county's district attorney's office on Thursday.

The 55-page report detailed accounts of nearly two dozen law enforcement officers who were able to take down Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife Tashfeen Malik. The report explains how police located the attackers and the evidence collected after they were killed.

Police identifed Farook after interviewing a co-worker who said the masked man that entered the Inland Regional Center had his same stature and body shape. Officers learned that Farook had rented a black SUV, which matched the description as the assailant’s car, according to the report.

Officers pursuing the couple in their getaway SUV were shot at while attempting to pull them over. Farook eventually stopped the car on a residential street, police said. Farook exited the vehicle and fired at police with a Smith & Wesson M&P15 semi-automatic rifle.

One San Bernardino officer recalled shooting Farook five or six times during the firefight. ""One of the rounds passed through Farook causing a mist of blood on impact,"" the report said. ""Farook fell to the ground but was still moving."" Farook was still clutching his rifle when he was shot two more times.

As Farook lay dying, his wife was ducked behind a backseat in the SUV. Officers said it seemed like she had been “blindly firing towards the officers rather than taking aim.” She was dressed in all black, carrying an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle and was wearing a load-bearing vest with several spare rifle and pistol magazines, along with an airsoft neck protector and black safety glasses.

Autopsies found that Farook was shot 27 times and Malik was shot at least 15 times.

In total, the couple fired about 80 rounds from rifles and one bullet from a handgun. Officers fired 440 rounds from rifles, shotguns and handguns. Several nearby homes and cars were struck by bullets, but no civilians were hit during the shootout.

Police scouring the SUV found a black backpack with 14 rifle and pistol magazines, a military-style ammunition container with 870 rifle cartridges that were loaded into 10-round clips, along with three rifle sighting systems and several bags filled with hundreds of ammunition cartridges.

According to the Riverside Press-Enterprise, the attorney’s office said the officers’ killing of the terrorists was justified. District Attorney Mike Ramos called the officers’ actions courageous.

“I call them heroes,” Ramos said. “You talk about being brave — I’ll tell you, I couldn’t do it.”

Terror suspect's NJ mosque has been under NYPD surveillance: Report,"The New Jersey mosque that New York City terror suspect Sayfullo Saipov reportedly attended has been under surveillance by the New York Police Department since 2005, according to a published report.

The Omar Mosque in Paterson, N.J., located near Saipov's home, is among multiple Muslim houses of worship in the New York metro area being studied by the NYPD as possible locations for “budding terrorist conspiracies,” NorthJersey.com reported.

An NYPD report from 2006 doesn't link any criminal activity to the mosque, but says it ""is believed to have been the subject of federal investigations.""

In the wake of Tuesday's deadly truck attack in Lower Manhattan, police and the FBI swarmed areas in New Jersey to which Saipov was believed to have ties. They included the mosque, an apartment building, and other residences and storefronts.

Police have identified Saipov, 29, as the suspect who allegedly killed at least eight people. He was described as an Uzbek national living in the U.S. since 2010, most recently in a burgeoning immigrant community in Paterson.

The truck used in Tuesday's attack was rented from a Home Depot store in nearby Passaic, N.J., authorities said.

Paterson Councilman Alex Mendez told NJ.com that he was “very concerned” with reports that the suspect, who reportedly shouted “Allahu akbar” (""God is great"") and pledged allegiance to ISIS, was living in the area.

“We have 52 nationalities,""Mendez said. ""They're hardworking people that come to Paterson to start a better life.""

Saipov reportedly moved to New Jersey from Tampa, Fla., to do just that. A Florida friend, Kobiljon Matkarov, told Fox News that the man he knew was “very friendly” and “very nice.”

But locals in New Jersey described Saipov in different terms.

Slavo Petrov, a 64-year-old neighbor of Saipov, said he saw the man in the area with his wife and two children, and noticed him going to the local mosque.

He described Saipov as unfriendly, adding that he ""never says good morning and never says good afternoon,” NJ.com reported.

Police confirmed to Fox News that Saipov is not a U.S. citizen and is originally from Uzbekistan, a former Soviet republic east of the Caspian Sea in Central Asia.

A 2016 U.S.-commissioned report said Uzbek nationals were “most likely to radicalize while working as migrants abroad,” according to the U.S. State Department.

Previous terror attacks linked to Uzbek nationals have included an attack at the Istanbul airport in 2016, preparing suicide bombers in Turkey, several plots to commit attacks in Russia, and a gruesome beheading of a child in Russia by a nanny who was reportedly religiously motivated.

Uzbeks have also fought in Afghanistan and Syria, the department noted.",https://www.foxnews.com/us/terror-suspects-nj-mosque-has-been-under-nypd-surveillance-report,N/A

Ruslan Maratovich Asainov, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in Kazakhstan, was charged with conspiracy to provide and providing material support to ISIS, including weapons training for recruits and advising the militant group, the statement said. He was also charged with obstruction of justice.

NEW YORK MAN ACCUSED OF PLOTTING ISIS-INSPIRED TERROR ATTACK IN QUEENS

Asainov allegedly traveled to Istanbul, Turkey in late 2013 and crossed the border into Syria, where he joined the terrorist organization. He rose through the ranks and became an “emir,” overseeing the training of other ISIS recruits in the use of weapons, according to prosecutors.

He is also accused of attempting to entice an informant working with the NYPD's intelligence division to join ISIS in Syria. Asainov told the informant he'd help get him a job, housing, food and $50 a month, according to a complaint unsealed in Brooklyn federal court in July.

Victim in NYC subway samurai attack linked to 2019 terror scare,"A New York straphanger who lost a duel with a swordsman on a Manhattan subway Thursday morning had been accused of planting fake bombs on another commuter train back in 2019, igniting a terror scare, according to authorities.

Larry Griffin, 29, had a violent morning at the Chambers Street subway station after an argument with another man left him bloodied around 9:20 a.m., according to investigators.

Griffin told police the argument broke out on a northbound A train, when the suspect allegedly ""menaced him with a sheathed sword.""

When the suspect got off, Griffin followed him and took out his phone to call 911, according to authorities. Then the other man allegedly whacked him in the head with the sword’s wooden sheath, which broke off and was recovered at the scene.

""The suspect fled topside to parts unknown,"" a police spokesperson said Thursday, and he remains at large. Griffin was treated at New York Downtown Hospital.

Griffin, in 2019, was accused of planting rice cookers at the Fulton Street subway station, near the World Trade Center, in 2019. Police found a third cooker a couple miles away on a sidewalk in Manhattan’s Chelsea neighborhood. He was still on parole for that at the time of Thursday's attack, according to the New York Post.

""Little Larry’s a good person. He’s got issues, but he don’t ever mean no harm or anything,"" Tara Brumfield told WSAZ-TV. ""Sometimes I don’t understand why he don’t use his smart for good, but the things that he does sometimes I question.""

Rice cookers can resemble pressure cookers – which have in the past been used to make bombs, including those used in the Boston Marathon attack in 2013 and another that rocked Chelsea in 2016, injuring 30 people.

Griffin's criminal history also predates his time in the Big Apple – with West Virginia authorities revealing after his bomb scare arrest that he had prior charges including possession of a controlled substance involving weapons and use of obscene material to seduce a minor.

However, police statistics show transit crime was up 41.1% year to date as of Oct. 16, the most recent data set available. Robberies have spiked 34.2% in that time, and felony assaults rose by 14.5%.

Adams' office told Fox News Digital that the city needs to ""battle both the reality of crime and the perception of crime.""

""Battling the perception of crime includes battling elements of mental health disorder, which include ensuring that those with serious mental illness aren’t wondering through the subway or posing a danger to themselves or others, and that our streets are clean,"" said Fabian Levy, the mayor's press secretary.

"Africa: the new ground zero for jihadi terror groups, experts say","Africa has been beset by jihadi violence, and it is something the U.S. will need to pay close attention to, observers warn.

On Sunday, a U.S. airstrike killed two al-Shabab terrorists in response to an attack carried out against U.S. partner forces in Somalia.

""The Islamic Jihad in Africa is real,"" claims Jasmine Opperman, South Africa based security consultant specializing in extremism and political violence, who believes Africa has taken over from the Middle East as the jihadis main area of operations.

""It definitely is the case"", Opperman told Fox News Digital. ""If one looks at the history of Africa, I'm going into Mali and the West Africa region, Somalia, the East Africa region, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Mozambique, we are seeing that al-Qaeda has always had an entrenched presence in Africa. We are seeing an environment conducive for these international terror groups to find themselves, embed themselves and take the lead in extremist activities in all of these regions.""

Earlier this month, Nigeria's most secure prison was overrun by jihadis, even though the Nigerian Minister of the Interior Rauf Aregbesola said Kuje Prison is a world-class facility and ""the most fortified in the country"".

NIGERIAN CHURCH ATTACK CASUALTIES REVISED DOWN TO 22 KILLED, 50 INJURED

However, a platoon of the Nigerian army ""with sophisticated weapons"" were no match when an Islamist jihadi movement decided to spring over 60 terrorists jailed there. The jihadis came to the jail located in the nation’s capital, Abuja, in three waves, attacking the facility for over two hours with over 300 militants, some firing rocket propelled grenades, one unit dedicated to blowing open the prison’s walls and another group taking up defensive positions in surrounding streets to prevent the army from sending in reinforcements.

Christopher Holton, director of the State Outreach Center for Security Policy, told Fox News Digital that the U.S. needs to pay close attention to what is happening in Africa.

""Historically, when jihadists are allowed a safe haven, they simply use it as a base of operations to spread jihad elsewhere. The example of al-Qaeda launching the September 11 attacks from Afghanistan and the 1998 East Africa embassy bombings from Sudan are instructive.""

Holton concluded that, ""Two of the most deadly jihadist groups in the world operate exclusively in Africa: Boko Haram and al-Shabab.""

In East Africa, the jihadi group al-Shabab, created 15 years ago in an already turbulent Somalia, have become poster boys of the jihad revolution with their flamboyant attacks on a U.S. air base in Mandla Bay, Kenya; the overrunning of a Kenyan army camp, killing 200; an attack on a Kenyan college campus which killed 148 people; the deadly siege of the Westgate Shopping Mall in Nairobi, Kenya, where at least 67 died; and enormous World War II - size bombings in Mogadishu, Somalia.

""The decision to reintroduce a persistent presence was made to maximize the safety and effectiveness of our forces and enable them to provide more efficient support to our partners,"" A U.S. National Security spokesperson stated. Special Forces personnel are claimed to be mostly advisers. However, it is known the U.S. does deploy drones to target jihadi leaders in-country, although whether the drones are flown long-range from the U.S. base in Djibouti is not known.

Opperman believes the huge growth of Islamist militancy across the continent is driven by common factors - weak governance, and often rural communities who have been neglected by governments and have lost trust in the system that should be protecting them.

The Boko Haram jihadi group jumped into the international spotlight when their members kidnapped 276 schoolgirls in Chibok, North-Eastern Nigeria in 2014.

Over 2 million people have fled their homes to escape Boko Haram in Nigeria alone, according to the U.N. Nearly 800,000 more have been displaced in the neighboring countries of Cameroon, Chad and Niger. Those captured have been forced to convert to Islam, and the women often turned into sex slaves.

However, for this jihadi group, things are changing. ""Boko Haram is not the same as we have seen a few years back"", says Opperman. ""Many of the fighters crossed over to the Islamic State West Africa province, (ISWAP) and we are seeing the ISWAP now even reaching into the Abuja area, the capital of Nigeria. It's this geographical expansion as far as Abuja that remains a concern.""

As soon as Nigerian authorities catch jihadi militants, a high proportion of them are put back into operation by their colleagues. There have been 15 assisted jailbreaks in the last seven years, helping 7,000 inmates to escape.

A little further north in Niger, the new French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna and Defence Minister Sebastien Lecornu reportedly signed a new agreement that will see French troops withdrawing from Mali with 1,000 of them setting up base in Niger equipped with fighter jets, drones and helicopters. Up to 400 more troops will engage in Special Operations on the borders of Burkina Faso and Mali, and an additional 700 to 1,000 personnel will be based in Chad. All of them, in this Sahel Region, will continue facing off both Islamic State and Al Qaeda-affiliated jihadis who have made this the most dangerous peacekeeping destination in the world.

Paris has had its troops in Mali, a former French colony, for nine years. However, their redeployment comes in the wake of a near doubling in violence in the Sahel in 2021, from 1,180 to 2,005 incidents. ReliefWeb states this was the most significant change in any of the theaters of Islamist violence in Africa this past year.

More than 2.7 million people have been forced to flee their homes in the Sahel, and at least 13.4 million are in dire need of humanitarian assistance, according to the U.N.

With reports of Russian mercenaries now operating in Mali, Opperman is concerned that the U.S., already present with drones and special forces in the area, will be sucked into a confrontation here with Moscow: ""We are seeing currently the tensions between France and Russia,"" says Opperman. ""France on the way out and Russia trying to move in. And this leaves a question: if we are going to see some United States expansion within the region.""

In Mozambique, jihadis are on a roll, where some 4,000 people have been killed, and more than 800,000 forced from their homes - and they are pushing South. The group, also known as al-Shabab, has warned South Africa to get its troops out of Mozambique, or they will attack this neighboring country, less than 1,500 miles from the conflict. Jasmine Opperman believes it is a question of when rather than if the jihadis will attack Johannesburg:

""No country border is a stumbling block for terrorists,"" concludes Opperman: ""The global expansion, the extremist jihadist ideology, demands of them to ever push the borders beyond what they believe will at the end of the day lead to a new world order and a new caliphate.""",https://www.foxnews.com/world/africa-new-ground-zero-jihadi-terror-groups-experts,N/A
"After Israel hits terror group, UN Security Council meets as some members rebuke the Jewish state","A group of largely anti-Israel countries on Monday pushed the United Nations Security Council to yet again turn Israel into its punching bag for merely defending itself against the Iranian regime-backed terrorist movement Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ.)

In his remarks ahead of the session, Israel’s U.N. ambassador Gilad Erdan singled out Norway and Ireland, who frequently bash the Jewish state, for their role in securing an emergency meeting.

""How would Norway react to Islamists plotting to fire missiles at civilians in Oslo? How would Ireland react if Jihadi rocketeers were raining down on Dublin in an effort to wipe out the ‘infidel?"" he asked.

Israel waged a three-day conflict with the U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization PIJ. Erdan said, ""The Palestinian (Islamic) Jihad deliberately fired eleven-hundred rockets at Israelis civilians, with roughly two-hundred landing inside the Gaza Strip, killing innocent Palestinians and among them young children.""

The Islamic Republic of Iran — the world’s worst international-sponsor of terrorism — has played a key role in stoking violence against Israel, Middle East experts say. Erdan noted, ""The Palestinian Islamic Jihad is a radical terror organization, armed, funded and trained by Iran.""

China holds this month's presidency of the Security Council and threw its support behind the emergency meeting.

The council session comes during a period of monumental crises, in which the U.N. seems largely paralyzed. A possible nuclear catastrophe is unfolding in Ukraine after shelling attacks struck a Russian-controlled nuclear facility.

Observers say the U.N. Security Council has largely been impotent in its efforts to stop an over six-month grinding war of attrition between Russia and Ukraine that has resulted in tens of thousands of dead, many more injured and millions displaced, largely women and children. Russia has faced allegations of war crimes in Ukraine.

In a reference to the U.S. recent neutralizing the commander of al-Qaeda, Ayman al-Zawahiri, in late July, Erdan noted the double standards at play.

US TAKES OUT AL QAEDA LEADER AYMAN AL-ZAWAHRI IN 'SUCCESSFUL' AFGHANISTAN COUNTERTERRORISM OPERATION

""That’s precisely why, when al-Zawahiri was eliminated, this institution, as well as most of the world, gave its full support. This was one step closer to eradicating radical terror from the world. Yet when Israel neutralizes such terrorists in order to prevent an imminent attack against our civilians, U.N. officials shamelessly issues deep concern. This is a blatant double standard and will not be accepted,"" he said.

As the Security Council met Tor Wennesland, the United Nations special coordinator for the Middle East peace process, noted, the ""preliminary numbers, which have yet to be confirmed, indicate that from 5 August, the Israel Defense Forces launched 147 airstrikes against targets in Gaza. Palestinian militants launched approximately 1,110 rockets and mortars into Israel, many of which landed deep inside Israeli territory.""

He added, ""During the escalation, 46 Palestinians were killed and 360 injured, and hundreds of residential housing units were damaged or destroyed, along with other civilian infrastructure. Seventy Israeli were injured, with damage to residential and other civilian structures.""

Israel’s government documented that misfired PIJ rockets killed Palestinian children and destroyed Gaza infrastructure.

During his remarks to the council, the Palestinian ambassador to the U.N., Riyad Mansour, did not criticize the terror group that Israel had targeted and termed the Israeli operation ""unprovoked and unjustified aggression.""

Mansour attributed the Israeli preemptive military operation to stop PIJ missiles from entering Israel to the ""upcoming Israeli election."" According to conspiracy theories circulating within far-left and radical Islamic circles, Israel eliminated the leadership of PIJ as an election stunt to advance the electoral chances of Prime Minister Yair Lapid in Israel's November election.

UN BODY ISSUES ‘ANTISEMITIC REPORT’ AGAINST ISRAEL, CRITICS CHARGE

The three European countries who, in addition to the U.A.E and China, called for the meeting seemed to turn a blind eye toward naming the PIJ as a terrorist organization.

France’s diplomat talked about stopping the ""spiral of violence"" but omitted any explicit criticism of the PIJ as a terrorist movement.

Norway’s representative blamed Israel for the ""occupation"" and ""settlement building"" in its remarks. The Norwegian official did not cite the PIJ. Ireland’s diplomat called Israel the ""occupying power."" It is unclear what the Irish diplomat meant by claiming Israel’s occupies the Gaza Strip.

Israel has not had a presence in Gaza since 2005 when it withdrew from the Palestinian enclave. There are no Israeli soldiers or citizens in Gaza; however, Hamas is holding two Israeli's hostage and won't release the bodies of two other Israeli soldiers. Ireland’s representative mirrored Norway and France by not naming the PIJ as a terrorist movement and the nature of its ideology.

In sharp contrast to the anti-Israel rebukes of the three Europeans, the U.S. Ambassador to the World Body Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said, ""Let us be clear: Palestinian Islamic Jihad is a designated terrorist organization in the United States and in many other nations. And it is also an Iranian proxy, which has conducted attacks against innocent civilians for years.""

She appealed to the fractured body ""to come together and unconditionally repudiate the terrorism of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad.""

"Alleged ISIS terror cell busted in Europe, Iraqi man suspected of carrying out 2 unsuccessful German train attacks","European authorities busted a suspected Islamist terror cell in central Europe, arresting an Iraqi ISIS sympathizer who allegedly carried out two unsuccessful attacks on trains in Germany last year.

The 42-year-old man was detained Monday in the Austrian capital of Vienna, where he normally lives. The authorities said he’s accused of “carrying out terrorist attacks on railway lines in Germany in October and December 2018.”

Czech authorities, meanwhile, arrested two individuals who allegedly formed a terror cell with the suspect of the train attacks.

Interior Minister Herbert Kickl told the Austrian parliament Thursday that the two suspects, who are believed to have formed a cell with the Iraqi, were arrested in Prague.

The suspect allegedly tried to commit mass atrocities twice last year. In October, he allegedly interfered with the train tracks in an effort to cause a high-speed derailment.

He left a steel cable stretched over the tracks between electrification masts on the Nuremberg-Munich line.

The attack was unsuccessful and damaged only the driver’s cab, with no reported injuries to the people on the train.

"Bloody tide: Terror deaths increased 8-fold since 2010, says study","The deadly toll of terrorism around the globe has jumped nearly 800 percent in the past five years, according to an exhaustive new report that blames the alarming expansion of Islamist groups across the Middle East and Africa.

The nonprofit Investigative Project on Terrorism found that an average of nearly 30,000 people per year have been killed by terrorists since 2010, when terrorism's death toll was 3,284. The authors of the study, which tabulated the numbers through the end of 2015, say that the exponential increase shows two troubling trends: More attacks are happening, and they tend to be deadlier than ever.

“Everyone has known that terrorist attacks have generally been increasing yearly since 9/11,” Steven Emerson, executive director of IPT, tells FoxNews.com. “But the magnitude of the increase of the attacks surprised us, especially in the past five years. Even if you look back at the annual reports issued by the most senior analysts in the top five intelligence and counter-terrorism agencies, there is not one report that predicted or forecasted that we would likely see such a massive escalation of attacks.”

“It’s clear that they are they [terror groups] are focused in in the Middle East and in Africa...And it’s in many of the countries where the U.S. has been involved. They have all become failed states.” — Former House Intelligence Committee Chairman Pete Hoekstra

The study says that the rise is due, in part, to the fact that Islamist terror groups are operating in more countries than ever, especially in the Middle East and Africa. ISIS, which split from Al Qaeda in early 2014, now has a presence or affiliation in several Middle Eastern countries, Africa and Southeast Asia.

In addition to ISIS, groups like Boko Haram in Nigeria and Al Shabaab in Somalia have been on the rise in the last few years. The Taliban has been resurgent in Afghanistan and Pakistan, where it took responsibility for Sunday's Easter attack on Christians in Lahore; Kurdish-affiliated groups have been blamed for bombings in Turkey; Palestinian terrorists have waged at least two uprisings in Israel and Al Qaeda has continued to be active in Syria and Yemen, among other locations.

The terror groups, particularly those in the Middle East, have new access to deadlier weapons, which they have used to destabilize governments and terrorize citizens, said Emerson.

He cited the descent of Libya and Syria into civil war and the willingness of Iran, Russia, North Korea and Qatar to provide arms to terrorist groups as reasons for the increased potency of terror attacks.

IPT's report used data collected by the University of Maryland’s Global Terrorism Database. Looking at various intervals following the 9/11 attacks, and sorting out deaths caused by clear acts of terrorism -- not simply war involving known terrorist groups -- IPT found annual terror deaths have jumped 774 percent since the 2007-11 average.

‘[The numbers] are striking when you take into account where the numbers were at the beginning period,” said Pete Hoekstra, who chaired the House Intelligence Committee when he represented Michigan in the U.S. Congress. ""I don’t think people have grasped how significant these [death toll] numbers are.""

Hoekstra, an IPT fellow, helped the IPT analyze data from four separate time periods, between 2001-2015. From 2001-2006, there was an annual average of 2,508 terror fatalities around the world. That number rose to 3,284 between 2007 and 2011. During 2012-2013, the annual average tripled to 9,537, and, in the past two years, that number tripled again, raising the death toll to a staggering 28,708 per year, making it the current annual average.

The U.S. has had success fighting individual terror groups, including Al Qaeda, but when one is suppressed, others rise, said Emerson. What is needed is a comprehensive approach targeting the ideology, he said.

“There has never been a U.S. or allied strategy to go after radical Islam,” Emerson said. “There have been, however, strategies to go after specific groups like Al Qaeda or AQAP or ISIS. But these are all subsets of radical Islam.”

The IPT analysis shows that the growth in terror-related murder is not only attributable to the emergence of ISIS, but also to a wider theater of operations for terror groups overall. While the Islamic State is responsible for at least 10,780 deaths since 2013, the rise of other extremist groups like Boko Haram and Al Shabbab in Africa has accounted for tens of thousands of terror deaths in the past five years.

“It’s clear that they [terror groups] are focused in the Middle East and in Africa,” Hoekstra said. “And it’s in many of the countries where the U.S. has been involved. They have all become failed states.”

Alarmingly, IPT expects the wave of terror to continue to grow in 2016 and beyond. Analysts see continued violence in the trouble spots throughout Africa and the Middle East, with conflict spilling over into Jordan, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Lebanon.

They also predict that Asia will see more terror attacks as countries like Thailand, The Philippines and India are perceived as soft targets, and that due to the migrant crisis, violence in Europe will increase over the next two years as extremists continue to exploit the immigration system throughout the EU.

Ironically, success in Iraq and Syria could lead to an expansion of ISIS' footprint, he said.

“With ISIS losing large swaths of territory as well as key commanders, its center of operational gravity definitely appears to be shifting to Europe, where it can recruit among the more than 30 million Muslims who live in Europe,"" Emerson said.

“Add to this mix the fact that thousands of mosques in Europe are controlled by Salfists, Wahabists and the Muslim Brotherhood – which indoctrinate their followers,"" he said, ""and you have a future recipe for a massive increase in Islamist terrorist violence.”",https://www.foxnews.com/world/bloody-tide-terror-deaths-increased-8-fold-since-2010-says-study,N/A
"Deadly Australia hostage-taking, shootout called a terror attack","A suspected terrorist who killed a man and took a woman hostage in an up-market suburb of Melbourne late Monday had arranged to meet her through an escort service.

Police are treating the deadly siege as an “act of terror”.

The fatal standoff, which ended in a volley of gunfire, saw a man murdered, the woman taken hostage, three officers shot, and the gunman killed by police.

The armed hostage-taker, identified by the police as Yacqub Khayre, was known by counter-terrorism police and had been on parole.

Police have this morning revealed the gunman had arranged to meet a woman at the Buckingham Serviced Apartments in Brighton after booking her services through an escort agency.

Victoria Police Commissioner Graham Ashton this morning told ABC the man shot an employee of the building before taking the woman captive.

“At the scene, when this person’s first arrived there, a man was shot, we believe, by the gunman,” Mr Ashton said. “He was an employee of the serviced apartments, so he appears to have been in the wrong place at, unluckily, the wrong time.”

Mr Ashton said Khayre had arranged to meet the woman.

“He’s arranged to meet her as part of an escort service and he’s booked her services and he’s met her there for the purposes of those services of the escort agency.”

Islamic State’s media arm has this morning released a statement claiming Khayre, who is reported to have been involved in a failed plot to attack an Australian military base, was “a soldier of ISIS”.

The siege began at Buckingham Serviced Apartments in the up-market bayside suburb of Brighton on Tuesday evening.

Heavily armed police swarmed the area when a female hostage, believed to be in her 20s, made a triple-0 call telling officers she was being held hostage and a man had been killed.

The first sign of a possible terror link came when a male caller claiming to be linked to the siege called the Channel 7 newsroom in Melbourne saying: “This is for IS” and “This is for Al-Qaeda.”

Seven reported a woman was heard screaming in the background.

The siege came to a dramatic end when the gunman opened fire on police, hitting three male police officers, two of whom were hospitalised with gunshot wounds while the other was treated at the scene.

Tactical officers shot dead the gunman in a volley of gunfire.

Egypt terror ensnares Israel as Sinai border crossing closed,"Warnings of an ""imminent"" terror attack forced Israel to close its Taba border crossing to the Sinai peninsula Monday, one day after terrorists in Egypt bombed two Christian churches, killing dozens of worshippers on Palm Sunday.

Soon after the announcement, rocket attack sirens wailed in parts of the region. The military said a rocket fired from Sinai exploded in southern Israel, hitting a greenhouse but causing no injuries. The Islamic State terror group later claimed responsibility for the attack.

PALM SUNDAY ATTACKS: SURVIVORS DETAIL HARROWING ACCOUNTS OF TWIN BOMBINGS

Israel urged its citizens to leave Egypt immediately, hours before the start of the Passover holiday, when Sinai is a popular destination for many secular Israelis. Yisrael Katz, Israel's transportation and intelligence minister, said in a statement Monday there was intel regarding a potential ""terror attack"" against tourists in the Sinai peninsula.

The crossing remains open for those wanting to return from Egypt. Foreign nationals also would be able to cross the border, Haaretz reported.

PENTAGON-BACKED SYRIA FIGHTERS PRESS ISIS

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a statement Monday sending Israel's ""condolences to the families of those who were murdered in yesterday's terrorist attacks in Egypt"" and wishing a ""quick and full recovery to the wounded.""

He said ""the world must unite and fight terrorism everywhere.""

The Israeli government statement says that intelligence information shows ""increased activity by Islamic State"" militants in Sinai. It adds that with the Islamic State group losing ground in Iraq and Syria, there is renewed ""motivation to carry out terror attacks in different arenas at this time.""

Israel called on its citizens to leave Egypt on the eve of the Passover holiday that commemorates the biblical Exodus story of the Israelites' escape from slavery in Egypt.

The weeklong festival is widely celebrated in Israel even among otherwise nonreligious Jews. But southern Sinai, with its pristine beaches and Red Sea coral reefs, has traditionally been a popular Israeli tourist destination -- especially for secular Israelis during the Passover holiday.

Israel mostly shuts down after sundown for the holiday, as families and friends gather for Seder, the ritual multi-course meal where the story of the exodus from Egypt is discussed in detail so that the tradition is preserved throughout the generations.

Leavened goods like bread and items made from yeast such as beer are banned during the holiday. Instead, Jews eat matzo -- unleavened bread -- to illustrate how the Israelites had no time to let their bread rise as they fled from bondage in the land of the Pharaohs.

Despite the relaxing draw of Sinai, tourism there has declined since 2013, when the Egyptian military overthrew an elected Islamist president and an Islamic insurgency based in northern Sinai intensified. Rocket attacks on Israel from Sinai are relatively rare but Islamic militants there have been behind a few attacks in recent years. Egypt has been battling the militants, many linked to the Islamic State group.

Israel issues travel recommendations from time to time based on intelligence reports. Monday's travel warning was unusual in its urgency and it is rare for the Taba crossing to be shut down.

Israel signed a peace treaty with neighboring Egypt in 1979 and the two countries maintain close security cooperation.

"Hamas’ cyber terror is a test case for other non-state players, report says","JERUSALEM, Israel — Iranian-backed Palestinian terror group Hamas, the de facto rulers of the impoverished Gaza Strip, is stepping up its cyber activities against Israel. And it's time for Western nations, including the U.S., to take such threats more seriously, a report published recently by Washington-based think tank the Atlantic Council has found.

According to the report authored by non-resident fellow Simon Handler, while the U.S. overwhelmingly focuses its cybersecurity concerns on the ""big four"" nation-state adversaries — China, Russia, Iran and North Korea — non-state actors are becoming increasingly organized and efficient in cyber warfare.

Hamas, a designated terror organization according to the U.S., is a clear test case for what such groups are capable of and, writes Handler, ""is an emerging and capable cyber actor.""

Handler highlights how Hamas, which has fought numerous wars with Israel and carried out countless terror attacks against its civilians, has not necessarily shifted its overall goals – to terminate what it views as the illegitimate state of Israel and establish an Islamic, Palestinian state in its place – but rather has now harnessed advanced high-tech terror options in its fight.

2 US CITIZENS INJURED IN JERUSALEM DURING DEADLY TERROR ATTACK, AMBASSADOR SAYS

""In other words, offensive cyber operations are a new way for Hamas to do old things better,"" notes the report, urging ""the policy community to think differently about how it approaches similar non-state groups that may leverage the cyber domain in the future.""

""I think that the U.S. and everybody else should be concerned because terrorists are using the internet,"" Brigadier General (Res.) Yossi Kupperwasser, a senior researcher at the Israel Defense and Security Forum, commented in an interview with Fox News Digital. ""What Hamas does against Israel can be done by other terror groups and against other targets.""

The report notes that ""a robust online presence is essential for modern terrorist organizations. They rely on the internet to recruit members, fund operations, indoctrinate target audiences and garner attention on a global scale — all key functions for maintaining organizational relevance and for surviving.""

Kupperwasser, a former head of the Israeli army’s Military Intelligence Assessment Division, said the cyberwar realm afforded terror groups the opportunity to cause broad damage at minimal risk. And, he said, Hamas had already carried out some ""pretty impressive"" operations in the cyber realm.

NETANYAHU VICTORY IN ISRAELI ELECTION PRESENTS 'STARK CHALLENGE' FOR US MIDDLE EAST POLICY



""They can cause real damage and, eventually, out of many attempts, one of them can be successful,"" he said. ""[Israel] has very good countermeasures, it’s an area where we excel. But in cyber, when you are on the receiving end, even if you manage to thwart many attempts against you, it is not foolproof.""

Israel has long claimed Hamas’ cyber capabilities pose an increasingly serious threat. During an intense round of fighting with Hamas in May 2021, Israel drew global condemnation for destroying a tower block in Gaza that housed the offices of The Associated Press and other media. The Israeli military later said the 11-story al-Jalaa building also housed the Islamist terror group’s electronic warfare site.

The Atlantic Council also gives the example of the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia when Israeli soldiers watched the matches on an app on their smartphones at an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) base. The Android app, Golden Cup, which was downloaded free from the Google Play store, was, in fact, malware that discreetly monitored the target’s device and stole sensitive information.

Prior to that, in 2017, Hamas used a series of fake Facebook accounts to connect with young recruits in an attempt to gain access to sensitive army information. Dozens of soldiers, mostly from combat units, were tricked into chatting with people they believed were young, attractive women in Israel and abroad, while Hamas accessed vital data on their phones.

""Hamas’ cyber capabilities have become increasingly sophisticated and have expanded to target not only Israel, but other countries it sees as hostile,"" Joe Truzman, research analyst at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD), told Fox News Digital. ""Over the last decade or so, Hamas and other Palestinian militant organizations recognized the cyber arena as an important field to weaponize and have slowly developed sophisticated methods to counter Israel.""

IRAN PICKS CYBER FIGHT WITH ISRAEL AS BOTH SIDES TARGET CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE

Last month, on its Telegram channel, Hamas published a tribute to the person it said had established the group’s cyber unit eight years ago. In the announcement, the group said it was ""keeping pace with scientific and technological development and inventing new methods in confronting the Zionist enemy (Israel)"" throughout its ""jihadist history,"" Israeli news channel i24 reported.

While the Atlantic Council report calls Hamas ""a green hat hacker,"" a group relatively new to the hacking world lacking sophistication, it determines that it is ""fully committed to making an impact and keen to learn along the way.""

""Hamas has demonstrated steady improvement in its cyber capabilities and operations over time, especially in its espionage operations against internal and external targets,"" the report said . ""At the same time, the organization’s improvisation, deployment of relatively unsophisticated tools and efforts to influence audiences are all hallmarks of terrorist strategies.""

""Hamas' recently revealed cyber unit does pose a threat against Israel,"" said Truzman. ""There were signs in 2019 that the Israel Defense Forces recognized it as a threat when it bombed a site in the Gaza Strip used by Hamas for cyber operations.

How Kabul became an evacuation bottleneck and a prime terror target: The Last 96,"This is the first part of a Fox News Digital Originals series about the fall of Kabul and the hectic and heroic 96-hour effort to evacuate Afghans fearing retribution from the Taliban.

America’s war in Afghanistan ended in calamity. Around 120,000 people were evacuated from Kabul in just a matter of days, but the herculean, if chaotic effort made the airport a prime target for a terrorist attack that killed nearly 200, including 13 U.S. service members.

But exactly how did Afghanistan, a nation with a military the U.S. trained for 20 years, so quickly fall to the Taliban and instability? How did Kabul become a frenzied site where tens of thousands of people were simultaneously trying to flee the country through the same escape route?

""It was just a compilation of events that led to this precipitous fall,"" a former senior Defense Department official, Mick Mulroy, told Fox News.

President Biden repeatedly reiterated his commitment to withdraw all U.S. troops from Afghanistan by Aug. 31, even as the Taliban swept through the country at a speed that, according to a spokesperson, surprised even the Taliban.

BIDEN WARNS ISIS-K AFTER KABUL TERROR ATTACKS, BUT STICKS TO AUG. 31 AFGHANISTAN WITHDRAWAL DEADLINE

Biden also repeatedly blamed the Afghan army for giving up rather than fighting the Taliban once the U.S. troops began to depart.

But the reality is more nuanced.

Afghanistan’s fall and a bottleneck at the Kabul airport were results of a combination of complementary factors, laid out by experts who spoke with Fox News: the peace deal’s effects on the Afghan government and military’s morale and confidence; the U.S.-trained Afghan army’s reliance on air support; the Taliban’s highly effective military and diplomatic strategies; and the U.S.’ failure to hold a crucial air base and keep the Taliban out of Kabul until it completed its evacuation.

A peace agreement violated

The Trump administration’s February 2020 peace deal crushed the Afghan government and military’s confidence, according to the Afghanistan experts. When Biden reaffirmed his commitment to the deal in April 2021, morale decayed further and simultaneously emboldened the Taliban just as the fighting season began.

""I think it was a mistake to negotiate with the Taliban,"" Mulroy, the Trump-era deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East, told Fox News. ""It was essentially a negotiation for our surrender.""

""It was clear that the way the U.S. treated the negotiations to depart essentially excluded [the Afghan government] as even relevant in it,"" Mulroy continued.

The peace deal required the Taliban and the Afghan government to enter peace talks, which ultimately fell apart.

""The current administration had no obligation to carry through on that agreement,"" said Mulroy, an ABC News national security analyst. ""It had been violated, and they chose not to carry through on a lot of agreements of the previous administration.

""So, the idea that their hands were tied, I think is just not true.""

Regardless, Biden announced that he would still withdraw U.S. forces from Afghanistan.

""When President Biden announced the complete troop withdrawal on April 14, it really registers among Afghans as a vote of no confidence in the Afghan government, as well as the Afghan army,"" Elliot Ackerman, an author and a former Marine and CIA intelligence officer, told Fox News.

""What you begin to see is a crisis of confidence and a complete collapse of those institutions, particularly as this announcement is made in the lead-up to the fighting season,"" Ackerman continued. ""When that fighting season begins, we see a very intense Taliban offensive that leads to one city in one key bit of strategic terrain falling after another, culminating in the fall of Kabul in August.""

BIDEN'S STANDING AMONG AMERICANS NOSEDIVES IN WAKE OF ROCKY AFGHANISTAN EXIT, COVID SURGE

Americans largely supported withdrawing from Afghanistan, polls conducted during the Trump administration and into Biden’s presidency found, though a recent survey showed they disfavored how Biden handled the pullout.

Ackerman pointed to a 2018 Rasmussen poll that found 42% either believed the U.S. was no longer at war in Afghanistan or didn’t know. Mulroy noted that surveys have shown decreasing support when respondents are asked if they would favor withdrawal if it meant the return of the Taliban or al Qaeda.

""This idea of an ‘endless war’ is more of a political slogan,"" Mulroy told Fox News.

Ackerman said: ""Somewhere in our American narrative, we seem to have got in our head that wars end when all the troops come home, that it’s a prerequisite for a war ending. If you look historically, that has never been the case.""

Ackerman and Mulroy both pointed to Germany, South Korea and Japan – all nations where U.S. forces fought during war and remained afterward.

""In fact, the troops only all come home when we lose wars,"" Ackerman said. ""We leave troops behind to secure peace.""

""And that is what led to this calamitous situation in Afghanistan,"" he continued.

Mulroy said U.S. casualties could remain low and stability could be maintained if the military kept 7,500 troops in Afghanistan.

""The Afghans were doing 98% of the fighting by the time we entered this so-called peace agreement,"" Mulroy, a former Marine and retired CIA paramilitary operations officer, told Fox News.

""The way we set up their military had them essentially dependent on our support,"" he continued, specifically highlighting U.S. air operations.

It was an Afghan army facing declines in both morale and air support that faced the Taliban’s emboldened aggression.

A strategic, swift sweep

The Taliban rapidly seized rural territory – sometimes by force, sometimes through negotiated surrenders – giving them control over the highways and the ability to prevent supplies from reaching more fortified outposts and urban centers.

It proved highly effective.

The Taliban controlled 77 of Afghanistan’s 421 districts when Biden announced his commitment to withdraw the troops by Sept. 11 (though he’d later move that to Aug. 31), according to the Long War Journal.

By early August, that nearly tripled to 223 districts. They were contesting another 116.

""We started seeing the Taliban essentially envelope provincial capitals without going in,"" Mulroy told Fox News. ""And what we saw them doing was essentially letting everybody know that as soon as this withdrawal happened that they would be taking over these towns.

""And there wouldn't be air support, our air support, to stop them.""

While it’s true, as Biden claimed, that some outposts surrendered without a fight, many others fought until their defeat.

In many places, the Taliban outnumbered Afghan forces, according to Mulroy. More than 1,400 Afghan security forces were killed from May through July, The New York Times reports.

""For those that have fought alongside them, we know that when put to the task, we've seen them fight,"" Mulroy told Fox News. ""We've seen them not only give up their lives fighting the Taliban, but save ours.""

""But another aspect … is every time we try to create a military in a mirror image force of our own, it does not do well when we withdraw our support,"" he added.

""We've designed that force to fight with a significant air component,"" Mulroy said. Many Afghan units had ""to totally change the way they fought, and they were incapable of doing it.""

As a result, the Taliban were able to seize rural outposts, often defended by a small number of undersupplied forces who had often not been paid in weeks or months. It also gave them access to the Afghan forces’ weapons and equipment.

""That is some of the most sophisticated in the world, now in the hands of the Taliban,"" Mulroy said. ""So, their army went from a militia, which is the one we defeated in 2001, to now one of the best equipped militaries out there. It's a shocking scenario that has played out in the worst possible way.""

The mounting victories and improved armaments became powerful tools when the Taliban demanded surrender.

TALIBAN SEEKING TO EXPAND CAPABILITIES WITH US WEAPONRY

The Afghan troops ""also saw, of course, that the international community didn't seem to be behind them in any way or any fashion,"" Mulroy said.

Taliban commanders would promise not to kill district chiefs and their men if they surrendered. The commanders would also often offer cash payments and even rides home to anyone who agreed.

Additionally, the Taliban were leveraging Afghanistan’s tribal nature.

""It's never been a really unified country with a strong central government,"" Mulroy told Fox News. ""It's always been the tribes.""

""They figure out a way to deal with whichever power happens to be there, and they also have to, for their own survivability, determine when that's about to change,"" he continued. ""And I think the constant talk about us wanting to depart, the lack of any real negotiations when it came to not even including the Afghans that were the official government we've been working for for 20 years, I think sent a message to the tribes that ‘you better start looking for another alliance.’""

The Taliban surrounded the provincial capitals but didn’t begin seizing them until Aug. 6.

""We started seeing the country fall,"" Mulroy said. ""We hadn’t even withdrawn yet.""

""They saw they had the momentum from a military perspective and just kept going and going and going because they wanted it to become a fait accompli,"" he told Fox News.

Despite the Taliban’s quick sweep across Afghanistan and through the capitals, Biden still refused to extend the U.S.’ withdrawal date. In fact, he told Afghan President Ashraf Ghani that the ""perception"" that the country was struggling against the Taliban needed to change ""whether it is true or not,"" Reuters reported.

The U.S. had ample warning based on intelligence community assessments and should have seen the government’s collapse coming, Mulroy told Fox News.

Ackerman told Fox News: ""By Aug. 10, the fall of Kabul is inevitable.""

Ghani fled Kabul on Aug. 15, and the Taliban took the city.

Bogged down without Bagram

The Taliban quickly established checkpoints throughout Kabul, including around the airport – the most practical means for Americans and their Afghan allies to flee the country, since the U.S. closed its airfields, including Bagram Air Base.

""We essentially allowed the Taliban to come into the Kabul region, which threw all of our evacuation plans into disarray,"" Mulroy told Fox News. ""We certainly had the capacity to keep them out.""

Ackerman said: ""With the fall of Kabul, that’s when the cries for help from Afghanistan become overwhelming.""

Beyond the approximately 6,000 American citizens that needed to be evacuated, tens of thousands of Afghans who feared retribution from the Taliban, including interpreters who helped the U.S. military, also sought to flee.

""One need only look at a map to recognize that Afghanistan is a landlocked country,"" Ackerman told Fox News. ""So any withdrawal is going to have to occur by air.""

""As the United States is collapsing and shutting air bases, it puts itself in a position where there ultimately is only one point of egress, and that becomes Kabul airport,"" he continued.

Ackerman also noted how a bipartisan group of lawmakers, led by Rep. Seth Moulton, sent a letter to the White House asking for a plan to evacuate the U.S.’ Afghan allies.

""That letter was met with silence,"" Ackerman told Fox News.

The U.S. left Bagram on July 2 in the middle of the night. Ackerman said that decision ""only adds to the calamitous nature of the final withdrawal from Afghanistan.""

Had it remained in U.S. hands, it could have served as an additional airfield for evacuations – one that the Taliban didn’t control.

Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has said the U.S. left Bagram because there weren’t enough troops to defend both it and the embassy in Kabul.

""It’s a false choice,"" Ackerman said. ""President Biden only need authorize Gen. Milley to have the troops he needs to keep both the U.S. Embassy and Bagram Air Base open at the same time.""

Instead, the U.S. exclusively used the Kabul airport and relied on the Taliban, its enemy for 20 years, for security from other adversaries.

"ISIS claims credit for terror attacks at Brussels airport, Metro station","DEVELOPING: ISIS has claimed credit for Tuesday morning’s rush-hour attacks in Brussels, which left at least 31 dead and more than 180 injured.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

As many as 31 people were killed and more than 180 injured as coordinated terrorist bombings rocked the Brussels airport and subway system during rush hour Tuesday morning in the Belgian capital.

Two bombings at Zaventem Airport, where 11 people were reportedly killed, and another at the metro station in the Maelbeek section near the European Union headquarters, where the mayor's office said 20 were killed, were almost immediately confirmed as terrorism. The attack at the airport was reportedly accompanied by shouts in Arabic and gunfire, and an unexploded suicide belt was reportedly found in the aftermath.

""What we feared has happened, we were hit by blind attacks."" — Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel

""What we feared has happened, we were hit by blind attacks,"" said Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel.

""We are at war,” French Prime Minister Manuel Valls said Tuesday. “We have been subjected for the last few months in Europe to acts of war.""

The attacks, which Belgian authorities said were suicide bombings, came four days after the main suspect in the November Paris attacks was arrested in Brussels, and even as Brussels was braced for new attacks.

A source told Fox News that a credible ISIS social media account posted the message, “Mosul revenge for the Kuffar capital Brussels,” but it was not definitive that the terror group was behind the attacks.

The first two explosions rocked the departure hall at the Brussels airport shortly after 8 a.m. local time. Early reports placed the number of dead at 13, with as many as 81 wounded, although the death toll was later revised downward to 11. Witnesses told The Associated Press that one occurred at an American Airlines counter and the other near a Starbucks cafe.

American Airlines said in a statement that none of its employees were among the dead or injured and later tweeted from its verified account that the blast did not occur at its check-in row.



“There were two explosions in the departure area, one probably caused by a suicide bomber,"" said Belgian federal prosecutor Frederic Van Leeuw of the attack on the airport.

One of the airport bombs may have been in a suitcase, a U.S. official told The Associated Press, and local TV reported that it may have been loaded with nails.

Witnesses recounted a harrowing and chaotic scene.

“First there was one explosion. Everyone started to run and panic broke out. Then a second explosion was heard,” one witness told The Brussels Times about the airport explosion.

Zach Mouzoun, who arrived on a flight from Geneva about 10 minutes before the first blast, told BFM television that the second, louder explosion brought down ceilings and ruptured pipes, mixing water with blood from victims.

""It was atrocious. The ceilings collapsed,"" he said. ""There was blood everywhere, injured people, bags everywhere.""

""We were walking in the debris. It was a war scene,"" he said.

Marie-Odile Lognard, a traveler who was lining up in the departures hall for a flight to Abu Dhabi, told BFM television that people panicked after the first explosion about 65 feet from her and that a second explosion about 15 seconds later caused parts of the ceiling to collapse.

""I knew it was an explosion because I've been around explosions before,"" said Denise Brandt, an American woman interviewed by Sky television.

""I felt the explosion, the way it feels through your body. And we just looked at each other and I said 'let's go this way.' It was over there. There was just this instinct to get away from it. Then we saw people running, crying, toward us. So I knew we were going in the right direction and away from it. ""

Amateur video shown on France's i-Tele television showed passengers -- including a child -- running with a backpack dashing out of the terminal in different directions as they tugged luggage. Belgian news channel RTBF reports a Kalashnikov rifle was found in the departure hall at the airport.

Marc Noel, 63, was about to board a Delta flight to Atlanta, to return to his home in Raleigh, N.C.

A Belgium native, Noel says he was in an airport shop buying automobile magazines when the first explosion occurred about 50 yards away.

""People were crying, shouting, children. It was a horrible experience,"" he told AP. He said his decision to buy the magazines might have saved his life. ""I don't want to think about it, but I would probably have been in that place when the bomb went off.""

Three Mormon missionaires, identified by the church as Richard Norby, 66; Joseph Empey, 20, and Mason Wells, 19, all of Utah, were the only Americans known to have been injured in the airport attack.

Moments later at the Metro station, another explosion was reported on a train that was stopped at the Maelbeek subway station, not far from the headquarters of the European Union. Ian McCafferty told The Irish Times he was just getting off the metro at the stop before Maelbeek around 8:20 a.m. when he heard a “loud muffled thud” but, because of construction at the metro, he “didn’t really think much of it.

“There was a large military presence and mass confusion,” he said. “People started to run. Some people were crying. The two stations are only a stone’s throw apart. We were the last train through the station before the blast.”

Rescue workers set up a makeshift treatment center in a local pub near the train station. Dazed and shocked morning travelers streamed from the metro entrances as police tried to set up a security cordon.

Brussels Mayor Yvan Majeur put the number of dead at the train station at 20, with more than 100 more injured.

Alexandre Brans, 32, who was wiping blood from his face, said: ""The metro was leaving Maelbeek station when there was a really loud explosion. It was panic everywhere. There were a lot of people in the metro.""

First responders ran through the street outside with two people on stretchers, their clothes badly torn.

The bombings in the European Union capital are certain to add new fire to the raging debate over refugees from Muslim nations where terrorist groups are active. Europe has taken in more than a million refugees, and terror groups including ISIS have said they are infiltrating the wave of migrants.

After his arrest on Friday, Salah Abdeslam, who is suspected of taking part in the Nov. 13 Paris attack that killed 130 people, told authorities he had created a new network and was planning new attacks.

After Abdeslam's arrest and before Tuesday's attacks, authorities were frantically hunting a suspect identified as 24-year-old Najim Laachraoui, who allegedly traveled to Hungary with Abdeslam before the Paris attack on Nov. 13. It was unclear whether Laachraoui played any role in Tuesday's bombings, but prosecutors say Laachraoui played a key role in recruiting attackers for ISIS.

U.S. authorities were monitoring the situation, poised to assist in the investigation. A U.S. counter-terrorism source told Fox News the priority for investigators is identifying the suicide bomber or bombers through DNA because they cannot operate in isolation, and identifying them can lead to the broader network.

Speaking Havana, President Obama mentioned the attacks before giving prepared comments on the thawing relationship between the U.S. and Cuba. Obama called the attacks “outrageous,” and pledged that the thoughts and prayers of Americans are with the Belgian people.

“This is yet another reminder that the world must unite, we must be together, regardless of nationality or race or faith, in fighting the scourge of terrorism,” said Obama, who had also spoken to Michel by phone.

Belgium's interior minister announced that the terror threat was being raised to its maximum level. All flights were canceled and arriving planes and trains were diverted.

Authorities told people in Brussels to stay where they were, bringing the city to a standstill. Airport security was also tightened in Paris, London and other European cities. Flights due to land at Zaventem, which handles 21 million passengers a year, were sent to Antwerp, Liege, and Brussels Charleroi airports.

French President Francois Hollande said ""terrorists struck Brussels but it was Europe that was targeted -- and all the world that is concerned,"" adding that ""this war will be long.""

Paris announced it would light the Eiffel Tower in the colors of the Belgian flag, and security around France's nuclear plants was reportedly increased, though no specific threat was cited.

ISIS claims London terror attacks that killed 7; police arrest 12 in raids,"The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the latest London terror attack through its propaganda wing Amaq News Agency, the SITE intelligence group reported Sunday.

The terror network reportedly claimed a ""detachment"" of its fighters crashed a rented van into a crowd of people on London Bridge before going on a stabbing rampage Saturday night, killing seven people and wounding nearly 50 others. However, ISIS gave no evidence to back up its claim.

Earlier on Sunday, British Prime Minister Theresa May condemned the “evil ideology” behind the London attacks.

May addressed the attacks Sunday after a meeting of the government’s COBRA emergency committee. She called for a tougher stance against extremists and tougher controls on cyberspace to prevent its use by extremists.

She said the measures were needed because “terrorism breeds terrorism” and attackers copy each other.

Counterterrorism police carried out raids in east London and arrested 12 people in connection with the attacks. ""Searches of a number of addresses in Barking are continuing,"" London Metro Police said as the raids were being conducted.

The homes raided included one belonging to one of the three terrorists who carried out the attacks, Sky News reported.

""He's lived here for about three years,"" neighbor Damien Pettit said. ""He's one of our neighbors. I've said hello in passing more than 50, 60 occasions. He has two young kids. He was a very nice guy.""

ISIS has claimed responsibility for a series of attacks in recent years -- but police have pushed back in some instances. The terror network announced it was behind the deadly attack on a casino and shopping complex in the Philippines last Friday -- but Manila police said the killer was a Filipino gambling addict heavily in debt, with no terror links.

Saturday’s horror began around 10 p.m. local time when a white van veered off the road and barreled into pedestrians on London Bridge. The van’s three occupants then jumped out with large knives and attacked people at bars and restaurants in nearby Borough Market, police said.

Elizabeth O’Neill said her son was stabbed in the stomach by a man who approached him and yelled “this is for Islam.”

Daniel O’Neill, 23, suffered a 7-inch knife wound, she said, according to Sky News. He was recovering.

""He had just stepped outside the bar for a second and a man ran up to him and said 'this is for my family, this is for Islam' and stuck a knife straight in him,” the mother said.

Gerard Vowles, 47, told local media that he saw the three attackers stabbing a woman at the south end of London Bridge. He said he threw chairs, glasses and bottles at the attackers in a bid to stop them.

""They went 'this is for Allah' and then they just started stabbing her multiple times,” he told Sky News.

The Guardian quoted Vowles as saying, “They kept coming to try to stab me. They were stabbing everyone. Evil, evil people.”

He added, according to the paper, ""I want to know if this girl is still alive. I've been walking around for an hour and a half crying my eyes out. I don't know what to do.""

Brad Myers, an American vacationing in London, told “Fox & Friends” Sunday that he had just taken some pictures and was about to walk along the Thames River when he heard a noise.

“Then I saw the van come on to the pavement and continue along the side of the road just right where I was a few moments before, just mowing down pedestrians,” he said.

“Everyone was in shock,” he said.

What he saw reminded him of the truck attack in Nice, France.

“It’s crazy to think I was right there,” Myers said.

Eight police officers killed the attackers after arriving on the scene within eight minutes.

The officers fired 50 shots, London's assistant police commissioner Mark Rowley said at a press briefing Sunday, calling the number unprecedented. One of the bullets struck an innocent bystander. The person was recovering in a hospital.

Rowley said that the officers had no choice.

""The situation these officers were confronted with was critical - a matter of life and death - three armed men, wearing what appeared to be suicide belts, had already attacked and killed members of the public and had to be stopped immediately,"" he said.

It turned out the suicide belts were fake.

Rowley said the van had been rented recently by one of the attackers.

May said 48 people were injured and many had life-threatening injuries. Thirty-six remained hospitalized Sunday.

A courageous cop was one of the wounded. He confronted the three knife-wielding terrorists armed only with a baton. He was stabbed in the face, head and a leg. He was in stable condition.

British Transport Police Chief Constable Paul Crowther said of the officer that ""it became clear that he showed enormous courage in the face of danger.""

Crowther added that ""for an officer who only joined us less than two years ago, the bravery he showed was outstanding and makes me extremely proud.""

Those killed included a Canadian and a French national.

May said the Thursday's national election would be held as scheduled because ""violence can never be allowed to disrupt the democratic process."" Major parties suspended national campaigning Sunday out of respect for the victims.

Speaking to Fox News from London, Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly said the latest attacks mark the fourth or fifth time he's had to call his British counterpart in just four months on the job because of ""terrible events like this.""

It was the third terror attack to hit Britain in as many months.

In March, a British convert to Islam ran down people with a vehicle on Westminster Bridge, killing four, then stabbed a policeman to death outside Parliament.

On May 22, a British suicide bomber killed 22 people and injured dozens at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester. After that attack, Britain's official threat level from terrorism was raised to ""critical,"" meaning an attack may be imminent. Several days later it was lowered to ""severe,"" meaning an attack is highly likely.

ISIS claimed responsibility for those two attacks.

ISIS resurfacing in Iraq as country looks to hit back at terror organization,"BAGHDAD, Iraq -The Islamic State caliphate, which held large swaths of territory in Syria and Iraq, was defeated in 2018, yet analysts are seeing signs, including a growing number of attacks in northern and western Iraq, of a resurgence, a cause for concern that needs to be watched closely.

""The Islamic State has begun to regain its activity in an attempt to gather what remains of its members,"" Fadil Abu Ragheef, an Iraq-based expert on terrorist groups, told Fox News Digital.

He said that while the organization had lost the main centers of power it held under the first generation of its leadership, it continues to pose a danger in the areas where it still has strength, the northern cities between Salah al-Din, Kirkuk and the Mam Mountains.

Ragheef also referred to areas in western Anbar that constitute a fortification for the organization and still pose a widespread danger. In recent months authorities have dismantled an ISIS arms factory for booby-trapping armored and fortified vehicles, presumably for suicide attacks in Kirkuk and elsewhere.

ISIS IS THREAT TO ENTIRE HUMAN RACE, IRAQI FOREIGN MINISTER SAYS IN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW

Recent attacks include suicide bombings close to Baghdad and other parts of the country, and Iraqi authorities have also uncovered and stopped some ISIS operations.

During an interview with Fox News Digital on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in September, Iraqi Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein urged western countries to keep going after ISIS.

He warned of the threat of the resurgence not just to Syria and Iraq but the world. ""What is going to happen?"" Hussein asked. ""That means they would be once again active inside Syria and that also they would cross the border, and they will come because Syria is not so far away from Iraqi border. So they will cross the border, and they will come to Iraq."" He called on countries to repatriate their citizens from the Al-Hol prison camp as Iraq had been doing.

Ragheef noted that while ISIS is nowhere near its previous strength, it has resumed its activities and is not going away. It is an ideological organization that continues to practice its activities with full force, he added, and is in the midst of reorganizing its ranks again.

CENTCOM CHIEF BELIEVES SYRIA IS 'BREEDING GROUND' FOR NEXT GENERATION OF ISIS

He said many ISIS members are among the approximately 57,000 people held in the Al-Hol refugee camp in Syria, and noted that the situation has become a growing concern for the U.S. and international community.

During a visit last month to the camp, Central Command chief Gen. Erik Kurilla warned that ISIS seeks to exploit the horrific conditions of the camp, where 70% of the population is under the age of 12. The general called the camp ""a literal breeding ground for the next generation of ISIS.""

Kurilla also noted that half of the camp’s residents are from Iraq and commended Iraq for repatriating its nationals.

Bill Roggio a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and editor of the Long Journal War, which follows the global war on terrorism, told Fox News Digital, ""The Islamic State, which is born out of al Qaeda in Iraq, is in a stage of resurgence. It has ebbed and flowed over the last two decades.""

""It has demonstrated an ability to regenerate after suffering major defeats,"" Roggio continued, ""and one of its traditional bases of support has been in northern and western Iraq, particularly the Hamrin mountains. The Islamic State has been in a rebuilding phase, having lost it caliphate in 2019, and is regaining some ground in western and north Iraq.""

Leaders of local public mobilization forces (PMF) formed to stop ISIS in 2014 say they are watching out for the terror group.

IRAQI LAWMAKERS ELECT NEW PRESIDENT HOURS AFTER ROCKETS FALL NEAR PARLIAMENT BUILDING

""Our eyes will stay focused on the terrorism and our fingers will be on our weapons to defend our country,"" Sayyid Hamid al-Yasiri, the leader of one group told Fox News Digital. Al-Yasri was appointed by the influential Shia cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani. Sistani, the supreme religious leader to Iraq’s Shiite community, holds massive sway in the country.

According to an Associated Press report, in 2014, Sistani called on able-bodied Iraqis to volunteer and join security forces to fight the onslaught of the Islamic State. The call was widely heeded, and the mobilization helped defeat the militants. But it also swelled the ranks of Shiite militias, many of which are loyal to Iran and have been accused of worsening sectarian tensions.

Al-Yasri and his group have made clear that they don't take orders from Iran. Indeed, earlier this year a pro-Iranian militia group tried to assassinate Al-Yasri following a speech he made that was critical of militias taking orders from outside interests.

""We have submitted several reports [to Iraqi authorities] that ISIS has started to be very active and there is an influx of foreign fighters from Syrian territory, and they are distributed from the island of Nineveh toward the mountainous regions,"" Al-Yasri said.

He added that his militia has been in contact with ISIS, killing some 14 terrorists in a recent battle, and said this ""proved that this organization has begun to return with force to these areas, and appropriate plans must be drawn up to confront it, and rely on the reports of the people of the field in evaluating ISIS' new movements.""

He noted that last month his group carried out seven operations, interspersed with multiple clashes and the seizure of four modern pickup vehicles, modern weapons, booby-traps, and huge food and drug stores. He concluded: ""As a field man… I see that ISIS has returned with strength and a new tactic based on a war of attrition and hit-and-run.""

Niger terror attack: ISIS-linked militants claim responsibility for massacre,"Islamic State (ISIS)-linked militants claimed responsibility for an attack on a military installation in western Niger near the border of Mali on Wednesday, which killed at least 71 people and left 12 injured.

The SITE intelligence group, which tracks jihadist media, said fighters from the Islamic State's West Africa Province (ISWAP) claimed responsibility for the attack, according to CBS News. The group splintered off from Boko Haram and is made up of 3,000 men.

The onslaught took place on Tuesday and caused President Mahamadou Issoufou to cut his overseas trip to Egypt short so he could return home to deal with the crisis.

The terrorist group reportedly numbered in the hundreds and was heavily armed as they descended upon the unsuspecting military camp. Niger's defense ministry claimed ""a substantial number of terrorists were neutralized"" in the process.

Two years ago, four U.S. service members were killed, along with four Nigerien soldiers, when they were ambushed by militants just 30 miles from the sight of this week's carnage.

NIGER MILITARY POST AMBUSHED BY SUSPECTED ISLAMIC MILITANTS, AT LEAST 70 SOLDIERS KILLED, OFFICIALSAY

The violence erupted just days before a summit where French President Emmanuel Macron was set to address the role of French soldiers in West African's Sahel region. The area has been seen as a hotbed of terrorist activity, Islamic extremism and kidnapping.

Nigerien and French forces have been unable to quell the violence as reports of military outpost attacks have increased, due to their cache of weapons and vehicles.

The extremists are reportedly taking advantage of the area's instability in an attempt to initiate a jihadist takeover.

Israel cheers report saying Iran terror group to remain on US blacklist,"President Biden has reportedly decided to keep Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) on the Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTO) list. While the White House has not confirmed the report, observers view this as a diplomatic triumph for Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett.

A report in Politico, Tuesday, quoted a senior Western official as confirming the decision. Bennett, whose ruling coalition has been plagued with infighting in recent weeks, released a statement late Tuesday night welcoming the move not to delist the IRGC. His statement noted that the decision was the ""right, moral and correct"" move and noted that it showed the United States' commitment to Israel's strength and security.

IRAN REVOLUTIONARY GUARD COLONEL IS SHOT DEAD IN TEHRAN

Bennett said Biden had informed him of his decision during their last conversation in April. Israeli Defense Minister,Benny Gantz was briefed on the issue in his meeting last week in Washington with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.

Israel has been a vocal opponent of the Biden administration's decision to try and revive the Iran nuclear deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA.)

The move by the Biden administration is expected to deliver a major setback to the nuclear talks with Iran, which have already been stalled for months. Iranian negotiators tied the delisting of the IRGC, along with the removal of sanctions, with its willingness to continue the negotiations.

REPUBLICANS SOUND ALARM ON POTENTIAL BIDEN MOVE TO PULL IRAN'S IRGC FROM TERROR LIST

A senior Israeli official told Fox News Digital that even though Israel is not part of the Iranian nuclear deal, it will continue to oppose it and do whatever it takes to protect the security and safety of its citizens: ""deal, or no deal.""

Observers say the Biden administration’s refusal to delist the group is a significant achievement for Israel. The effort they note was led by national security adviser Eyal Hulata and Shimrit Meir, an outgoing adviser to Bennett.

Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told Fox News Digital that, ""Retaining the IRGC on the FTO list helps with more than just Iran policy, it helps with Washington's broader counterterrorism policy. In this respect, designated terror groups will know that there is no way to avoid terrorism penalties unless they shed the capability and intent to support terror.""

He continued, ""Rather than confound diplomacy, this can help strengthen Washington's hand and begin to unwind the image that it will fold on non-nuclear sanctions in a nuclear deal.""

IRAN WEEKS AWAY FROM ACQUIRING MATERIALS FOR FIRST NUCLEAR WEAPON

On Wednesday the Biden administration’s point man on the Iran nuclear deal, Robert Malley, was quoted by Reuters as saying, ""We don’t have a deal with Iran and prospects for reaching one are, at best, tenuous."" His remarks, Reuters reported, were part of his prepared statement to the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee.

Last week, Gantz warned that Iran was moving ever closer to its nuclear goal by doubling its storage to 60% of enriched uranium over the past two months, and said it was only weeks away from stockpiling sufficient material to construct its first nuclear bomb.

PM NAFTALI BENNETT: ISRAEL WILL NOT BE BOUND TO NUCLEAR DEAL WITH IRAN

The former head of Israeli military intelligence recently voiced a different opinion than the current defense chief and said a nuclear deal with Iran would delay its nuclear efforts and buy Israel time. Tamir Hayman noted that time is an important factor and that ""many other things can be done: threaten, improve military capabilities, build international coalitions or create an agreement for the period after the current agreement,""

Apart from its efforts to stall the deal, Israel has targeted Iranian moves in the Middle East and taken action against Iranian proxies in the region. It has also been suspected of assassinating Iranian generals involved in the Iranian nuclear program or in the planning of attacks against Israelis abroad.

The latest assassination took place last week, when two gunmen on a motorbike killed Col. Hassan Sayyad Khodaei outside his apartment in Tehran. Khodaei was part of the Qods forces, which oversee foreign actions on behalf of the regime.

Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi vowed to avenge his death, blaming ""global arrogance,"" a reference typically used to describe the U.S. and its allies, such as Israel.

When asked by reporters on Tuesday to confirm reports of the IRGC staying on the terror list, State Department spokesman Ned Price did not offer a comment.

Israel foils Palestinian terror group's attempt to enter Gaza from sea,"Israeli defense forces exchanged gunfire Tuesday with a Palestinian terror squad, which attempted to enter an area north of Gaza to carry out a terror attack amid rocket fire, Algemeiner.com reported.

The newspaper, citing Israeli Army radio, reported that Israeli forces exchanged gunfire with the squad and killed four gunmen. It is unclear when the firefight took place, but the terror squad was reportedly attempting to enter the Kibbutz Zikim area from the sea.

""Two terrorists from Gaza infiltrate in area,"" Mickey Rosenfeld, a police spokesman, wrote in a tweet. ""Situation under control. People told to stay inside.""

The report of the gunfire exchange come as the Israeli military launched what could be a long-term offensive in the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip on Tuesday, striking more than 100 sites and mobilizing troops for a possible ground invasion in what Israel says is an operation aimed at stopping a heavy barrage of rocket attacks.

At least 15 Palestinians, including three children, were killed in the attacks from air and sea, Palestinian medical officials said.

The military said the open-ended operation aims to deliver a blow against the Islamic Hamas group, and end the rocket fire that has reached deeper into Israel in recent days.

""It won't end in a day and it won't end in two days. It will take time,"" Yitzhak Aharonovitch, the country's Cabinet minister for internal security, told Channel 2 TV, during a visit to the rocket-scarred southern city of Ashkelon.

"Israel-Gaza conflict escalates following Palestinian rocket, terror attacks","Conflict between Israel and Gaza militants continued to escalate Thursday following a series of rocket attacks launched into Israel and corresponding Israeli countermeasures.

Hamas militants fired the first rocket into Israel in months Monday and continued to ramp up the aggression, leading to a flurry of rockets Wednesday evening. Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) have responded each time with airstrikes on Hamas militant targets within Gaza.

""In the last month, terrorist activity against Israel has been on the rise: 14 Israelis were murdered in terror attacks. Palestinians chose to violently riot at the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. Terrorists in Gaza launched multiple rockets into Israel—including last night,"" the IDF tweeted Thursday.

The escalation comes amid growing unrest within Israel, where a wave of Arab terrorist attacks killed 14 in March and early April. Israel responded to the attacks with crackdowns in the West Bank, which resulted in 15 Palestinian deaths.

Palestinian protests have also rocked the Aqsa mosque, known as the Temple Mount in Judaism. The area is a holy site for both religions, and thousands of Palestinians gathered there last week to pray during the month of Ramadan.

When the prayers were finished, however, many participants began protesting and marching in the area surrounding the mosque. It is unclear what initially sparked violence, but protesters were soon throwing rocks at Israeli police, who made hundreds of arrests. More than 150 Palestinians were injured in the incident.

Israel Police announced arrest of ISIS-linked suspect in bus station terror bombings,"Israeli Police on Tuesday announced the arrest of a suspect believed to be responsible for two bus station bombings that killed two people and injured more than 20 others last month, including two Americans.

A joint investigation by Israeli Police, security forces, and the Israeli Defense Forces led to the arrest of 26-year-old Aslam Faruch, a Palestinian resident of East Jerusalem. Police said the suspect harbors a Salafi-jihadist ideology that is linked to the terrorist organization ISIS.

Faruch, a mechanical engineer by training, is accused of orchestrating the attacks that occurred on Nov. 23, when bags laced with explosives were detonated remotely at two bus stations, according to Israeli Police. The bombings were condemned by global leaders, and U.S. Ambassador to Israel Tom Nides called the explosions ""cowardly terrorist attacks.""

Two Israeli citizens, Tadasa Tashume Ben Ma’ada and Arye Shechopek, were killed in the blasts.

Israel's i24 News reported that Faruch was originally detained on Nov. 29, but his arrest was not cleared for publication until now because of a gag order.

Faruch allegedly fled the scene of the attacks on a motorized scooter and was hiding in a cave in the Judean desert, where an explosive device was also discovered.

Investigators said that Faruch was unknown to Israeli anti-terrorism agencies before his arrest. DNA evidence linked him to evidence discovered at the scene of the bombings, The Jerusalem Post reported. One other suspect was arrested and accused of plotting another terrorist attack with an explosives belt, according to police.

""As part of the investigation, additional suspects were arrested. It was revealed that one of the suspects was planning to carry out a separate terror attack in the area of the central bus station in Jerusalem,"" Israeli Police said. ""The suspect's arrest thwarted his intentions.""

"London van attack: Suspect identified, arrested in terror investigation","The man suspected of mowing down a crowd exiting Ramadan prayers at a London mosque early Monday has been identified as 47-year-old Darren Osborne of Cardiff, Wales, sources told Sky News.

At least one person was killed and 10 others were injured in the assault, which authorities were treating as a terrorist attack.

Osborne, reportedly a father of four, was arrested on suspicion of terror offenses in the collision with pedestrians outside the Muslim Welfare House, Metropolitan Police said. People at the scene shouted at him: ""Why did you do that? Why?""

""This man was not known to authorities in the space of extremism or far-right extremism,"" Ben Wallace, Britain's minister for security, told Sky News.

The incident occurred outside the Finsbury Park Mosque shortly after midnight after Ramadan prayers. Police said all of the injured were members of the Muslim community. Muslim leaders decried the collision as a hate crime and asked the public to stay calm.

Police said eight of the injured were taken to three hospitals and two suffered minor injuries and were treated at the scene.

Witnesses reported seeing at least one person receiving chest compressions. Police said that person was the lone death in the incident, but it was unclear if it was the van that caused the death.

Prime Minister Theresa May described the attack as a ""sickening"" attempt to destroy liberties that unite Britain, such as freedom of worship. She added that the man acted alone. May said earlier she would chair an emergency security Cabinet session later Monday and that her thoughts were with the injured, their loved ones and emergency officials who responded to the incident.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has responded to the attack and said the Secretary of Homeland Security, John Francis Kelly, has been briefed.

“DHS stands with our European allies in fighting back against all forms of terrorism, and we will continue to work together to keep our communities safe against violent extremists who target any of our people,” a statement by the DHS said.

“Our thoughts and prayers are with all affected by these violent and reprehensible attacks.”

A leader of the Muslim Council of Britain called for extra security at mosques in light of the apparent attack. The group's general secretary, Harun Khan, described the incident as a hate crime against Muslims.

""During the night, ordinary British citizens were set upon while they were going about their lives, completing their night worship,"" he said. ""It appears from eyewitness accounts that the perpetrator was motivated by Islamophobia.""

London Mayor Sadiq Khan, the first Muslim to serve in that position, said extra police would be deployed. He called the incident a ""horrific terrorist attack.""

Khan also called on Britain's government to supply more funding and resources to the city's police force.

""My message to the Government is - we need to get the right of level of funding for a capital city,"" Khan said in a news conference.

Video filmed in the immediate aftermath showed a Caucasian man being detained by police.

Imam Mohammed Mahmoud, who reportedly stopped the suspect from being harmed by a group of angry people, said he and others did their best to calm tensions.

""We extinguished flames of anger or mob rule that would have taken charge,"" Mahmoud said.

The chairman of the Finsbury Park Mosque said the van crash that hit worshippers was a ""cowardly attack"" and urged Muslims going to mosques to be vigilant.

Mohammed Kozbar said the Muslim community is ""in shock."" He complained that the ""mainstream media"" was unwilling to call the attack a terrorist incident for many hours.

London police closed the area to normal traffic. A helicopter circled above the area as a large cordon was established to keep motorists and pedestrians away.

Witnesses told British media that the van seemed to have veered off the road and hit people intentionally. They also said two men jumped out of the van and fled the scene, but police said the suspect was only one man and the investigation is still ongoing.

Mohammed Shafiq of the Ramadhan Foundation, a Muslim organization, said that based on eyewitness reports, it seems to be a ""deliberate attack against innocent Muslims.""

Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said in a tweet he was shocked by the incident.

Britain's terrorist alert has been set at ""severe,"" meaning an attack is highly likely.

Mali: 'Africa's Afghanistan' sees France withdraw troops and terror groups run amok,"It is being called Africa’s Afghanistan, a land where militants linked to both al Qaeda and ISIS jihadists fester, reaping terror, death, displacement and despair. Named the world’s terrorism hotspot, a third of all terrorism-related deaths in 2021 spilled blood over this country’s dusty plains.

Some 2,700 have been killed in West Africa’s Mali in the first six months of this year, up 40% on last year. As the mayhem escalates in this region known as the Sahel, this week the last unilateral Western peacekeeping force was pulled – or was it pushed – out. Mali’s military junta is now letting Russia’s shadowy Wagner mercenary group reportedly run amok, with an ever-growing catalog of human rights abuses against Mali’s people.

""Is Mali Africa's Afghanistan?"" Jasmine Opperman, a security consultant specializing in extremism and political violence, discussed with Fox News Digital. ""Looking at its history, looking at the complexities of the driving forces, looking at international actors’ involvement aggravating the security situation and acting as a trigger mechanism for extremism, I think we can definitely conclude that based on the similarities, Mali can be considered as Africa's Afghanistan.""

AFRICA: THE NEW GROUND ZERO FOR JIHADI TERROR GROUPS, EXPERTS SAY

Former colonizing power France withdrew the last of its 5,100 peacekeeping troops this week, with the insults of an ungrateful Mali regime freshly ringing in its ears, saying France’s President Macron should ""permanently abandon his neocolonial, paternalistic and patronizing posture to understand that no one can love Mali better than Malians,"" spokesman Col. Abdoulaye Maiga said on local TV.

Mali has turned to Russia for help, allowing Moscow’s Wagner PMC or private military company to do its dirty work: ""Violence against civilians in Mali has increased significantly since the Wagner Group’s arrival in December 2021,"" Catrina Doxsee, associate director and associate fellow of the Transnational Threats Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Fox News Digital.

Doxsee added: ""The military junta in Mali, which gained power through a coup in 2021, has prioritized its own power and self-preservation above stability or civilian well-being, and it likely views the Wagner Group’s presence primarily as a tool for 'coup-proofing.' Since Russia and its affiliated PMCs have little concern over human rights abuses, they are appealing partners for an illiberal regime like Mali’s junta.""

BLINKEN FLIES INTO 'SUPERPOWER' BATTLEGROUND IN AFRICA

The Russians are far from discreet. As the final French troops flew out of the northern Gao airport this week, two cargo planes landed and reportedly Russian military teams openly unloaded weapons.

Mali is said to be the most dangerous assignment in the world for its 12,000-strong U.N. peacekeeping force. ""Since its deployment in 2013, more than 250 peacekeepers have lost their lives, 159 of them in hostile incidents, including IED attacks,"" the spokesperson for the United Nations' Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission (MINUSMA) told Fox News from Bamako, Mali.

ISIS and al Qaeda relentlessly attack U.N. troops both out on patrol and back at their barracks. ""The biggest threat remains the attacks by improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and mines against our convoys and patrols to protect civilians, especially in the northern and central parts of the country,"" the spokesperson said. ""The mission camps have also become targets of terrorist armed groups using direct and indirect fire attacks against the U.N.""

RUSSIA WAR WILL HAVE 'SHATTERING' EFFECT ON FOOD SHORTAGES IN AFRICA: 'YOU'RE GOING TO SEE GOVERNMENTS FALL'

MINUSMA’s own so-called explosive ordnance disposal teams search for and deactivate IEDs, but intelligence gathering is perhaps hampered in this deeply devious arena by a United Nations charter that prohibits clandestine intelligence work.

In a 2017 report on peacekeeping in Mali, Researchgate, a scientific research group, noted what it said was a clash of cultures between countries supplying their troops to the U.N.: ""Marrying the Western and African capabilities turned out to be challenging due to incoherent procedures, systems, levels of experience as well as reporting mechanisms. In addition, information-sharing from classified NATO databases proved difficult"", the report stated.

The Mali government doesn’t make it easy for the U.N. to help them. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock accused the regime of having ""torpedoed time and again"" Berlin’s efforts.

This week, Germany suspended most of its operations in Mali, after the government denied flyover rights for Germany’s U.N. aircraft. In the last few days, Egypt has suspended its participation in Mali after seven of its soldiers were killed, and the local regime is still holding 49 Ivory Coast U.N. troops who were arrested when they turned up for duty in Bamako a month ago.

Ominously, last week the Institute for Security Studies’ Martin Ewi briefed the U.N. Security Council that Islamic State fighters fleeing Syria are ""finding safe havens on the continent,"" and that Africa may be ""the future of the caliphate"".

Opperman is concerned the U.S., as in Afghanistan, may get drawn in: ""We have a situation in Mali where superpowers have been sucked in or are withdrawing, we have seen now with France stepping aside, with Russia moving in, and who knows how the U.S. will respond to this.""",https://www.foxnews.com/world/mali-africas-afghanistan-france-withdraw-troops-terror-groups-run-amok,N/A
"Manchester attack: UK terror threat level raised to 'critical,' another attack may be imminent","British Prime Minister Theresa May announced Tuesday that the country’s terror threat level has been raised to its highest level based on evidence gathered during the investigation of the deadly attack at a Manchester Ariana Grande concert, signifying that another attack may be imminent.

""The threat level should be increased, for the time being, from severe to critical,"" May said, adding the assessment is ""a further attack may be imminent.""

Raising the country's threat level means that armed military personnel will replace police officers at some public events, such as sports matches, according to May.

""It is a possibility we cannot ignore, that there is a wider group of individuals linked to this attack,"" she added.

UK TERROR THREAT LEVELS: WHAT DO THEY MEAN?

Based on intelligence provided by the British, a U.S. government official told Fox News the evidence points to a suspect who was ""coached or trained on line or in person"" to carry out the attack.

The official described the bomb placement to Fox News as “perfect” to maximize casualties, which required planning.

Earlier on Tuesday, British authorities identified the suicide bomber who launched a deadly attack at the concert, hours after the Islamic State terror group claimed responsibility for the blast.

TRACING THE MANCHESTER BOMBER: WAS HE PART OF A NETWORK?

Salman Abedi, 22, was identified as the man who detonated an improvised explosive device at about 10:30 p.m. local time Monday, killing more than 20 people, some of them children, and injuring dozens more, Manchester police confirmed in a news conference on Tuesday. At least 12 children under the age of 16 were injured, emergency responders said. An 8-year-old girl was among the dead.

May said Abadi was born and raised in Britain.

MANCHESTER TERROR ATTACK SUSPECT IDENTIFIED AS SALMAN ABEDI

It was previously reported that Abedi was 23, but police clarified that another 23-year-old man was arrested. Two warrants have been issued at two separate residences. Officers used a police-controlled explosive device to gain entry into one home.

ISIS claimed on Tuesday that ""a soldier of the caliphate planted bombs in the middle of Crusaders gatherings"" then detonated them, but Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats said that the U.S. had not yet verified that the terror group was responsible.

TRUMP CALLS ON ALLIES TO 'OBLITERATE THIS EVIL IDEOLOGY' AFTER MANCHESTER BOMBING

The explosion unfolded outside Manchester Arena as Grande’s concert was coming to a close. The pop star, who wasn’t injured, reportedly suspended her Dangerous Woman Tour following the attack. She wrote on Twitter, ""broken. from the bottom of my heart, I am so so sorry. I don't have words.""

Officials believe the device was packed with shrapnel, built to inflict as much human damage as possible, according to U.S. law enforcement sources. Manchester police said one of their priorities is to investigate whether the attacker acted alone or had some kind of support.

Around the United Kingdom and across Europe, the attack brought fear and mourning. At Buckingham Palace, Queen Elizabeth II marked a moment of silence along her husband Prince Philip as well as Prince Charles and his wife Camilla. In Rome, the lights of the Colosseum and Trevi Fountain were darkened.

While on a visit to the West Bank city of Bethlehem, President Donald Trump called the perpetrators ""evil losers"" and said ""this wicked ideology must be obliterated.""

Manchester, located 160 miles northwest of London, is one of Britain's largest cities. The attack was the deadliest in Britain since four suicide bombers killed 52 London commuters on subway trains and a bus in 2005.

The claim of responsibility by ISIS echoed others the group has made for attacks in the West but with vague details that left open the possibility it was an opportunistic attempt at propaganda.

Manchester itself has seen terror before, but not this deadly. The city was hit by a huge Irish Republican Army bomb in 1996 that leveled a swath of the city center. More than 200 people were injured, although no one was killed.

The bombing also elicited painful memories of the 2015 terror attacks in Paris, where most of the 130 killed were at the Bataclan concert hall.

"Norway nightclub shooting: 2 dead, 10 injured in suspected terror-linked attack","A shooting at a Norway nightclub and in nearby streets that left two dead and 10 wounded Saturday night is being investigated as a possible terrorist attack, Norwegian police said.

A Norwegian citizen opened fire at the London Pub, a local LQBTQ+ bar in Oslo, just a few hours before the Oslo Pride Parade was set to take place. Police said the suspected gunman, a 42-year-old originally from Iran, was arrested after opening fire at three locations.

Barstad said the motive of the shooting was not immediately evident and it was unclear whether the shooting had any connection to the Pride Parade, according to The Guardian.

""Police are in contact with the organizers of the Pride event this Saturday,"" Barstad said, according to The Guardian. ""There will be a continuous assessment of what measures police should take to protect that event and whether this incident has a connection to Pride at all.""

Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre shared his sentiments on his Facebook page, calling the attack a ""terrible and deeply shocking attack on innocent people"".

The suspect was believed to be the sole perpetrator of the crime. Two firearms were seized, including a handgun and an automatic weapon.

Norwegian journalist Olav Roenneberg recalled witnessing the shooting, saying he saw a man arrive with a bag who then began shooting.

""First I thought it was an air gun. Then the glass of the bar next door was shattered and I understood I had to run for cover,"" he told Norwegian public broadcaster NRK.

Putin sparks fears of new 'Red Terror' in 'Stalin-esque' speech on 'fifth column' traitors in Russia,"Vladimir Putin is adjusting his rhetoric following his stalled invasion of Ukraine, touching on Stalinist nostalgia and patriotic themes to boost public support for the war, which he calls a ""special military operation"" and claims was launched as a defensive measure.

In a speech Thursday, he peppered his remarks with ""Stalin-esque"" dog whistling and warnings of a ""fifth column"" of Russian ""scum and traitors"" working to undermine his ambitions from within, according to a translation of his remarks.

""The West, collectively, is trying to fracture our society … to provoke a civil conflict in Russia by means of the fifth column,"" he said. ""The goal is Russia’s collapse.""

This is a dog whistle to those people who are Stalin supporters and supporters of a strong authoritarian hand. — Rebekah Koffler

RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES

He called for a ""self-purification"" to rid Russia of internal war critics and accused the West of ""canceling"" Russia on the world stage while claiming Europe has ""united"" itself with ""Hitler’s aggression"" against Russia. A banner on the stage read, ""For a world without Nazism"" in Russian. Before invading Ukraine, he accused Kyiv of being run by ""neo-Nazis"" and ""drug addicts.""

""The Russian people will always be able to differentiate true patriots from scum and traitors and will simply spit them out like an insect that accidentally flew in and got trapped in your mouth,"" he continued. ""I am confident that a necessary self-cleansing of society will only strengthen our country, our solidarity and readiness to respond to any challenges.""

At the same time, his government is cracking down on dissent and independent journalism, locking up seven reporters in connection with government events in Moscow and St. Petersburg Friday, according to the OVD-Info group, which monitors politically motivated arrests.

Prosecutors also charged an expat food blogger with violating a new law banning criticism of the Russian military, which carries a punishment of up to 15 years in prison. And a TV producer from the Kremlin’s leading state-owned network was fined last week after photobombing her own set during a live broadcast with an anti-war message.

It’s an equivalent of the ‘Red Terror’ period during Stalin, who galvanized the Russians to look for ‘the enemies of the people’ and turn them into Secret Police. — Rebekah Koffler

US FEARS PUTIN MAY LEAN ON NUCLEAR THREATS IF RUSSIA CONTINUES TO FAIL IN UKRAINE

""Putin is calling on the Russian people to root out and expose the traitors and bring them to the attention of government authorities,"" said Rebekah Koffler, a former Defense Intelligence Agency officer and author of ""Putin’s Playbook: Russia’s Secret Plan to Defeat America.""

""He is basically encouraging people to turn in their friends and neighbors whom they perceive as ‘the fifth column,’"" she told Fox News Digital. ""It’s an equivalent of the ‘Red Terror’ period during Stalin, who galvanized the Russians to look for ‘the enemies of the people’ and turn them in to Secret Police. Stalin authorized murders of millions of people who were perceived as disloyal to the Soviet government and the Communist Party.""

She said Putin may be deliberately leaning into Stalin-inspired messaging because the late Soviet dictator’s popularity is actually on the rise. More than half of the country viewed Stalin as a ""great leader"" during polling last year, and in 2017, Putin was viewed as one of the most outstanding figures in Russian history, outranked only by Stalin.

""What Putin is now counting on is there will be a ‘Red Terror’ again, like we had back in Stalin’s time, and that people will be afraid to speak the truth, fearing somebody will overhear and report on you,"" Koffler explained. ""This is a dog whistle to those people who are Stalin supporters and supporters of a strong authoritarian hand.""

UKRAINE-RUSSIA WAR: OVER 6.4M PEOPLE DISPLACED IN UKRAINE, 12M STRANDED OR UNABLE TO FLEE, UN COALITION SAYS

Over the years, Putin has painted treason as ""the most heinous of crimes,"" according to Koffler.

""This is why he has authorized assassinations and poisonings of former intelligence officers, like Alexander Litvinenko and Sergei Skripal, who became turncoats and served as double agents for the U.S. and Western intelligence,"" she said.

Dmity Ivanov, a 22-year-old antiwar activist from Moscow, told Reuters that within hours of Putin’s remarks, his mother found threatening graffiti outside their shared apartment.

""Don’t betray the motherland,"" it warned. He told the outlet that at least three other people, two activists and a journalist found similar graffiti that evening.

Nataliya Bugayova, a nonresident National Security Research Fellow at the Institute for the Study of War in Washington, D.C., said Putin has steadily progressed from an authoritarian toward totalitarianism over his 20 years in charge. He has a strong control of the flow of information within Russia and effective security forces capable of clamping down on protests quickly with minimal resources.

But he could face risks if he overextends his resources.

""You cannot be a Stalin without an oppression regime large enough to act,"" Bugayova told Fox News Digital. ""He’s still very strong, but this is the first time I think there will be a challenge there to act on his increasingly authoritarian agenda.""

The situation hasn’t immediately made Putin’s grip on the country vulnerable, she said. ""However it does mean there are vulnerabilities if someone were to take advantage of them.""

UKRAINE PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY WARNS OF DIRE CONSEQUENCES IF HIS COUNTRY FALLS: WWIII 'MAY HAVE ALREADY STARTED'

""The repression security services are used to comfortable living and need to be economically supported,"" she said. ""I think this is the first time where that might be called into question, because of the effects of sanctions, [they] might make it challenging for Putin to feed his whole repression regime.""

Even so, Putin’s aggressive denunciation of ""traitors"" could solidify his control without a new ""Red Terror"" by simply driving people out.

""I think he’s betting on the following,"" Bugayova said. ""First, keep only those in Russia who subscribe to his agenda, or those who may not subscribe keep them silenced or marginalized … and drive everyone else out.""

Unlike the former subjects of the Soviet Union’s Iron Curtain, Russians who want to leave the country now can choose to do so – at least ostensibly. Their goals, however, may be complicated by increased costs, COVID-19 travel restrictions and Western sanctions, Bugayova said.

WHITE HOUSE PRE-SCREENED QUESTIONS FROM TIKTOK INFLUENCERS DURING SPECIAL BRIEFING LAST WEEK, ATTENDEES SAY

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has also claimed that Russians critical of the war or of Putin’s government were removing themselves voluntarily.

""They are vanishing from our lives themselves. Some people are leaving their posts, some are leaving their active work life, some leave the country and move to other countries,"" Peskov told Reuters Thursday. ""That is how this cleansing happens.""

During Putin’s rally Friday dedicated to the eighth anniversary of Russia’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region, he left out the rhetoric about a fifth column of infiltrators and aimed at bolstering public support for the war in Ukraine, according to Koffler.

He invoked patriotic symbolism, the Bible and proud moments of Russian history, she said.

RUSSIA, UKRAINE WAR: KREMLIN MISSILE ATTACKS STRIKE LVIV, SEEN AS CROSSROADS FOR REFUGEES AND AID DESTINATION

Putin’s speeches come as his Russian military’s advance has halted in Ukraine, facing a military resistance Western analysts say the Kremlin gravely underestimated.

Bugayova called the miscalculation there ""mind-blowing,"" especially eight years after Russia’s invasion of Crimea in which, she said, the Kremlin wanted to seize six regions from Ukraine but had to settle for portions of two.

""To me, that suggests the information flow and that analytical flow from top to bottom in the Kremlin is broken,"" Bugayova said. ""Putin is, because of that, losing a bit of touch with factual information on the ground. I wouldn’t say he’s going crazy.""

Still, experts fear that as Moscow’s ground troops continue to falter, the Russian military will continue to escalate attacks on civilian targets in an effort to force Kyiv into concessions in order to end the conflict – a doctrine of escalation to deescalate.

The conflict has already claimed at least 816 civilian lives and injured more than 1,330, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, although officials say the tolls are likely higher.

Western analysts say as many as 7,000 Russian troops may have died as part of Putin’s invasion. Ukrainian defense forces claim to have killed more than 12,000.

Several killed in Spain anti-terror operation after Barcelona attack,"Police in Spain announced early Friday they killed five people in a suspected second terror attack in Cambrils, hours after a van rammed into a crowd about 70 miles away in Barcelona, killing at least 13 people.

State-run broadcaster RTVE reported the suspects attempted to carry out a similar attack to the one in Barcelona, by driving a vehicle into pedestrians. It said seven people were injured — two seriously — by the suspects.

Authorities said the suspects were wearing bomb belts.

The Catalan government says an attack in the seaside resort town of Cambrils has been linked to the vehicle attack in Barcelona. The region's Interior Minister Joaquin Forn told local radio RAC1 early Friday that the Cambrils attack ""follows the same trail. There is a connection.""

He did not explain what connected the attacks.

BARCELONA ATTACK: WITNESSES DESCRIBE 'CHAOS' IN THE STREETS AFTER DEADLY CRASH

Meantime, authorities were on the hunt for the van driver that killed at least 13 people and injured more than 100. It was not immediately clear how the suspects killed in Cambrils may have been connected to the Barcelona attack.

At least three people have been arrested as suspects in the Barcelona incident, according to the regional president of Catalonia. One of the suspects is a Spanish national from Melilla, and the other is a Moroccan citizen who lived in Spain legally.

ISIS claimed responsibility for the terror attack on Thursday through its propaganda arm, according to SITE Intel Group.

""The perpetrators of the attack in #Barcelona are Islamic state soldiers and carried out the operation on command of [ISIS' leader] of targeting coalition countries,"" the ISIS release stated.

A senior police official said the van attack is connected to a gas explosion inside a house in the town of Alcanar Wednesday, in which one person was killed and seven were injured.

Authorities confirmed that police fatally shot the driver of a vehicle that drove through a police checkpoint and struck two officers earlier, but a Catalan police official said the dead driver ""doesn't have any connection with the terrorist attack we are investigating.""

Police initially named Driss Oukabir, the Moroccan, as a suspect in the attack. However, local media are reporting a man with that name told police that his identification documents were stolen, possibly by his younger brother.

BARCELONA TERROR ATTACK: TIMELINE OF RECENT VEHICLE INCIDENTS IN EUROPE

The white van jumped onto a promenade and sped through a pedestrian zone on Las Ramblas of Barcelona, the famous main pedestrian walk way that crosses the city. The van swerved from side to side as it plowed into tourists and residents.

""It was clearly a terror attack, intended to kill as many people as possible,"" senior police official Josep Lluis Trapero said at a news conference.

RTVE reported that investigators think two vans were used — one for the attack and a second as a getaway vehicle.

Police killed a gunman in a shootout a few miles from Barcelona soon after the crash, El Mundo newspaper reported. However, police said later the gunman was not linked to the terror attack.

Local media originally reported two men involved in the attack had been holed up in a bar, but that was dispelled by Catalan police.

Barcelona Mayor Ada Colau announced a minute of silence will be held Friday in the city's main square ""to show that we are not scared."" The moment of silence will be followed by three days of mourning.

""We are a strong city in its diversity and values. Barcelona is a city of peace, of dialogue, of democracy, valient, open to the world. The cowards that have tried to plant terror will not get away with it,"" Colau said.

""London, Brussels, Paris and some other European cities have had the same experience. It's been Barcelona's turn today,"" said Carles Puigdemont, the head of the regional government.

Prime Minister of Spain Mariano Rajoy tweeted that he is going to Barcelona.

BARCELONA TERROR ATTACK: LAWMAKERS AND NATIONAL FIGURES REACT

A grisly video of the incident appeared to show at least five people lying motionless on the ground, with legs twisted and heads bloodied.

""It was real chaos, people started running, screaming. There was a loud bang,"" eyewitness Ethan Spibey told Sky News.

Footage from reporters on the ground shows armed officers combing a market.

Albert Tort, a 47-year-old nurse who lives near Las Ramblas, told El Pais that what he saw at the scene was an ""authentic disaster.""

""Police would not let me go through but I identified myself as a nurse and I went in,"" he said. ""What I saw was an authentic disaster. I counted at least 6 dead, I tried to revive a young [man] but it was impossible.""

""I heard a lot of people screaming and then I saw the van going down the boulevard,"" another witness, Miguel Angel Rizo, said. ""You can see all the bodies lying through Las Ramblas. It was brutal. A very tough image to see.""

Barcelona resident Keith Fleming told the Associated Press he was watching television in his building on a side street just off Las Ramblas when he heard a noise and went out to the balcony to investigate.

Fleming said he saw ""women and children just running and they looked terrified,"" he then heard a bang, possibly from someone rolling down a store shutter, as more people raced by.

The American living in the Spanish city said police arrived, and pushed everyone a full block down the street. He says the officers are still there with guns drawn and riot police are stationed at the end of the block.

President Trump condemned the attack, saying in a tweet, ""The United States condemns the terror attack in Barcelona, Spain, and will do whatever is necessary to help. Be tough & strong, we love you!""

Speaking from Panama, Vice President Pence called the day ""tragic."" He acknowledged that ISIS took credit for the attack, and said ""whoever is responsible should know, together with our allies, we will punish those responsible"" and rid ""Islamic terror"" from the world.

""This latest attack, the worst terror attack on Spanish soil since the 2004 Madrid train bombings, shows us again that radical Islamic terrorism is one of the greatest threats that we face today,"" Pence said.

""ISIS has taken credit for this barbaric attack, but whoever is responsible should know that the United States of America, together with our allies, will find and punish those responsible and drive the evil of radical Islamic terror from the face of the Earth.""

BARCELONA 'TERROR': TRUMP, STATE DEPARTMENT MONITORING SPAIN ATTACK

Emergency services in Catalonia say they have asked the Metro and train services in the area to close. Police cordoned off the broad street and shut down its stores, and asked people to stay away from the area so as not to get in the way of the emergency services.

Facebook has activated its Safety Check feature that lets users notify friends and family that they are safe following the Barcelona attack.

Barcelona's tourism association has offered rooms in area hotels to tourists who have been displaced by the attack.

The U.S consulate in Barcelona said on Twitter it was ""aware of a reported incident at Las Ramblas in Barcelona. Please avoid the area and monitor local police @mossos for updates.""

""Americans in Spain: If you are safe, be sure to notify friends and loved ones. If you use social media, be sure to update your status,"" the consulate tweeted.

The National Counterterrorism Center, the government hub for threat analysis, confirmed to Fox News the center is monitoring the events in Barcelona and note the use of a vehicle as a weapon.

TRUMP CONDEMNS BARCELONA TERROR, SAYS US 'WILL DO WHATEVER IS NECESSARY TO HELP'

The Department of Homeland Security said Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Elaine Duke has been briefed on the situation. ""DHS has reached out to Spanish authorities, and the Department is standing by to support our allies as they respond to and recover from this horrendous attack. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and those affected,"" the agency said in a statement.

On Twitter, the Department said those who need information on U.S. citizens in Spain, to call 888-407-4747 if in the U.S. or Canada.

Spain has been the target of numerous terror attacks in the last few years, drawing the attention of the U.S. State Department.

The attack was the country's deadlist since 2004, when Al Qaeda-inspired bombers killed 192 people in coorindated attacks on Madrid's commuter trains.

Since July 2016, vehicles have been used to ram into crowds in terror attacks across Europe, killing well over 100 people in Nice, Berlin, London and Stockholm.

Las Ramblas is a packed tourist area in central Barcelona whose central feature is a broad promenade leading to the water. The stretch is lined with numerous shops, restaurants, a sprawling market and Gaudí architecture.

People walk down a wide, pedestrianized path in the center of the street, but cars can travel on either side of the area.

"Spain’s government probing ‘terror’ motive in church machete attacks that left 1 dead, others injured","A man wielding a machete killed a church maintenance worker and injured several others – including a priest – at two churches in southern Spain Wednesday, and authorities are looking into possible terror motives.

The horror unfolded in the town of Algeciras, near the southern tip of Spain around 7 p.m. An armed man entered the San Isidro church and assaulted a priest, who was seriously injured, Spain’s interior ministry said.

The assailant went to a second church, the Nuestra Señora de La Palma – a five-minute walk away – and continued his rampage, assaulting a church maintenance worker. The worker ran outside where the attacker dealt him the mortal wounds in a public square, the ministry said.

Local media reported that at least three other people were injured.

Town officials identified the worker as Diego Valencia and the wounded priest as Antonio Rodríguez. The town hall said he was hospitalized and in stable condition.

The suspect was arrested and is in the custody of Spain's National Police. The ministry did not identify him, but local media reported that the assailant was a 25-year-old Moroccan.

Video footage obtained by Reuters shows two officers escorting a man in a hooded sweatshirt and handcuffs through a police station.

Spain's National Court said a judge has opened an investigation into a possible act of terrorism. Police are investigating the incident, the interior ministry said, to determine the ""nature of the attack."" It offered no further detail on the attacker's possible motive.

""I want to express my sincerest condolences for the families of the [church maintenance worker] slain in the terrible attack in Algeciras,"" Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez wrote on Twitter. ""I desire the injured a swift recovery.""

The town hall declared a day of mourning when flags will fly at half-staff.

""We are all stunned by these acts, which have filled us with pain,"" Mayor José Landaluce said. ""Algeciras has always been a city where concord and tolerance reign, despite incidents like this that create an image that does not correspond to reality.""

Sri Lanka attack shows ISIS is not 'Junior Varsity': counter-terror expert,"Despite a weakened presence in places such as Iraq and Syria, the Islamic State terrorist group remains a serious threat, said Aaron Cohen, a counter-terrorist and security expert, on ""Fox & Friends"" Wednesday.

Cohen, a former member of Israel’s elite special forces, said the Easter attack on Sri Lanka churches, hotels and other sites that claimed the lives of more than 300 people showed that ISIS appears to be sowing terror through small, affiliated groups.

""The fact that Sri Lanka was able to be attacked by a terror group which essentially had no name at first before ISIS connected the thorns,"" Cohen said, ""and the fact that this terror organization is connected to ISIS as a smaller proxy organization, or a puppet organization, and the fact that ISIS is able to connect these threads to wannabe, nomad terror groups"" means the pressure on them ""must stay on.""

""Fox & Friends"" host Ed Henry recalled when President Barack Obama in 2014 likened ISIS to a junior varsity basketball team in an attempt to downplay the terrorist group's level of threat to international security.

SRI LANKAN WOMAN LOSES MOST OF HER FAMILY IN EASTER BOMBINGS

""Here we are years later...they can still take deadly action,"" Henry said to Cohen.

""What I will say is unlike junior varsity sports teams, terror organizations are extremely well-funded by countries such as Iran,"" Cohen said, ""continue to not only pay terrorists to carry out acts of terrorism, but fund their families in case they're lost in the acts of terrorism because they're looked at as heroes.""

As the death toll from the Easter bombings in Sri Lanka rose to 321 on Tuesday, the Islamic State group, also known as ISIS, claimed responsibility and released images that purported to show the attackers, while the country’s prime minister warned that several suspects armed with explosives are still at large.

A top Sri Lanka government official said the suicide bombings were carried out by Islamic fundamentalists in apparent retaliation for the New Zealand mosque massacres last month that a white supremacist has been charged with carrying out.

SRI LANKA'S LEADER CALLS FOR OFFICIALS' FIRINGS AS EASTER SUICIDE BOMBERS REVEALED TO BE 'WELL-EDUCATED PEOPLE' WHO STUDIED ABROAD

Cohen said that ISIS militants ""are masters in guerrilla warfare, people shouldn't take this lightly.""

The security expert said that ISIS uses the Internet to recruit militants.

""They use...the dark web to build, plot, plan, and execute a wave of what we call nomad or solo terror attacks,"" Cohen said.

ISIS, which traces its roots back to the bloody emergence of Al Qaeda in Iraq after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion, has survived past defeats and is waging a low-level insurgency in areas it was driven from months or even years ago.

The Islamic State group, which has lost all the territory it once held in Iraq and Syria, has made a series of unsupported claims of responsibility and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said that investigators were still determining the extent of the bombers’ foreign links.

Sri Lankan authorities have blamed the attacks on National Towheed Jamaar, a little-known Islamic extremist group in the island nation. Its leader, alternately known as Mohammed Zahran or Zahran Hashmi, became known to Muslim leaders three years ago for his incendiary speeches online.

The IS group’s Aamaq news agency released an image purported to show the leader of the attackers, standing amid seven others whose faces are covered. The group did not provide any other evidence for its claim, and the identities of those depicted in the image were not independently verified.

Turkey objected to the addition of both Sweden and Finland to NATO last month, arguing the two countries' support for Kurdish rebels in the Middle East constitutes support for terrorist organizations.

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg confirmed Tuesday that Sweden ""already started to change its counter-terrorism legislation,"" and ""will ensure that the legal framework for arms exports will reflect their future status as a NATO member with new commitments to allies.""

Turkey inches closer to invasion of northern Syria as Islamic State terror threat grows,"There is significant concern that Turkey’s planned ground invasion into Syria to root out the U.S.-allied Kurds could open the floodgates for the release of thousands of imprisoned Islamic State terrorists.

Syrian Kurdish forces have incarcerated thousands of ISIS terrorists from more than 50 countries in prisons in northeastern Syrian.

Brigadier Gen. Patrick Ryder, the Pentagon’s press secretary, said Wednesday, ""Recent air strikes in Syria directly threatened the safety of U.S. personnel who are working in Syria with local partners to defeat ISIS and maintain custody of more than 10,000 ISIS detainees.""

CENTCOM CHIEF BELIEVES SYRIA IS 'BREEDING GROUND' FOR NEXT GENERATION OF ISIS

Turkey recently launched air strikes targeting the Syrian Kurdish military organization—The People’s Defense Units (YPG) in Syria and the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) in Iraq.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan declared, ""This is not limited to just an air campaign,"" adding, ""We will consult with our defense ministry and general staff and decide together to which our land forces needs to contribute, then take our steps accordingly."" Earlier, Turkey's defense minister was quoted by the country's media as saying the operation continues with some 326 enemy combatants killed so far.

Combating a resurgence of the terrorist movement Islamic State remains a top priority for the U.S. military. The U.S. formed an alliance with the YPG to oust ISIS, while conflict between Erdogan and the Kurdish forces in Syria may be moving from a localized conflict to a full-blown war.

Ryder noted that an ""Immediate de-escalation is necessary to maintain focus on the defeat-ISIS mission and ensure the safety and security of personnel on the ground committed to the defeat-ISIS mission.""

Turkish Embassy officials in Washington told Fox News Digital, ""We have time and again pointed out threats against our national security, posed by the PKK/YPG terrorist network in Syria and Iraq. We have always called for unequivocal and genuine solidarity in the face of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.""

ISTANBUL EXPLOSION RIPS THROUGH POPULAR STREET MARKET, KILLING 6, 81 INJURED: REPORTS

The Turkish diplomat added, ""Notwithstanding, the terrorist organization continued its attacks, recently targeting innocent civilians in the heart of Istanbul. As a result of the attack perpetrated on Nov. 13, 2022, six civilians were killed and 81 injured.""

The U.S. government has classified the PKK as a terrorist organization, but views the YPG as valuable partner in the fight against the Islamic State.

U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price recently said, ""We express our sincere condolences for the loss of civilian life that has occurred in Syria and Turkey"" and urged an ""immediate de-escalation.""

Intensive Turkish air and drone strikes have killed Syrian Kurds and pulverized critical industries in northern Syria, Sinam Mohamad, the representative of the Syrian Democratic Council to the U.S., told Fox News Digital.

Mohamad said the region’s Arabs, Christians and Kurds, who make up the area’s five million people, are ""suffering.""

SYRIAN KURDISH FORCES MOVE IN ON ISLAMIC STATE-CONTROLLED PRISON

She added Turkey has bombed the region 47 times from Nov. 19-23, and the air strikes killed six soldiers from the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), including two anti-terror soldiers trained by the U.S. military.

Mohamad, who is in contact with Syrians on the ground in the conflict zone, said Turkish forces have killed 15 civilians since the start of this round of air strikes: ""Turkey is now targeting vital infrastructures, power stations, grain silos, and oil and gas infrastructures.""

She claimed the Turks attacked a hospital and they ""targeted very close to an ISIS prison. Imagine if they targeted the prison, and the people escaped. It is a very critical situation. The international community and U.N. should take action to prevent Turkey from destabilizing the region.""

A leading expert on Turkey, Hay Eytan Cohen Yanarocak, from the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security, cast significant doubt on Turkey’s rationalization for launching its most recent attacks.

""The latest terror attack against Istanbul was carried about by Syrian forces who were dissatisfied with Turkey’s U-turn because Turkey signaled it was willing to normalize relations with [Syrian President] Bashar al-Assad,"" he told Fox News Digital.

He added, ""Erdogan knows very well that it would be a lot easier to punish the Kurds instead of punishing Syrians. We know the Free Syrian Army is considered an ally of Turkey. If the Free Syrian Army was tagged as responsible [for the terror attack in Istanbul], his foreign policy doctrine would collapse.""

TURKISH OFFICIAL ACCUSES US OF COMPLICITY IN DEADLY BOMBING: 'THE KILLER IS AMONG THE FIRST ONES RETURNING'

The pro-Kurdish party, The People’s Democratic Party, in the Turkish parliament submitted a motion requesting an inquiry into the Istanbul attack. Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party along with his ally, the Nationalist Movement Party, rejected the investigation.

All Kurdish military forces in Syria, as well as the PKK, have flatly denied responsibility for the Istanbul terrorism attack. The commander of the SDF, Gen. Mazloum Abdi, speaking exclusively to Fox News’ Jennifer Griffin, claimed the Istanbul bomber was from the Islamic State.

Turkey has captured a Syrian Arab woman who Turkish authorities said confessed to the bombing. Erdogan has faced accusations of showing sympathy for radical Islamists operating in northern Syria.

Uzay Bulut, a Turkish political analyst and research fellow for the Philos Project, told Fox News Digital, ""If Kobane falls to Turkey, Turkey will occupy it alongside jihadists organizations, as they also do in other Syrian cities such as Idlib and Afrin. Naturally, these Turkish military attacks against the SDF will weaken the counter ISIS campaign in the region.""

According to Bulut, ""The Turkish regime must be fully aware of that such an occupation only helps ISIS and al-Qaeda affiliated terror groups in the region.""

A Turkish official rebuffed such an argument and told Fox News Digital, ""We are the only NATO ally that has boots on the ground and fought DAESH [Islamic State] chest-to-chest since the outset.""

Turkey’s foreign policy stature has gained greater currency within the Biden administration since Russia invaded Ukraine in February. Soner Cagaptay, the director of the Turkish Research Program at the Washington Institute, said, ""Turkey is helping Ukraine militarily"" against Russia.

Turkey furnished Ukraine with 50 mine-resistant vehicles. Erdogan’s government has also sold the Bayraktar TB2 drone to Ukraine. The unmanned aerial vehicle carries laser-guided bombs. The Turkish drone has been a powerful weapon in pounding Russian forces.

Even in light of Turkey’s improved international reputation, Cagaptay does not see the Biden administration leaving the Syrian Kurds out to dry.

Turkish court convicts the president of the country's medical association of terror charge,"A court convicted the president of the Turkish Medical Association on Wednesday of disseminating ""terror organization propaganda"" following a trial that human rights groups had denounced as an attempt to silence government critics.

The court in Istanbul sentenced Dr. Sebnem Korur Fincanci to nearly three years in prison but also ruled to release her from pre-trial detention while she appeals the verdict.

Fincanci, 63, was arrested in October and charged with engaging in propaganda on behalf of the banned Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK. The arrest followed a media interview in which she called for an independent investigation into allegations that the Turkish military used chemical weapons against Kurdish militants in northern Iraq.

Fincanci is the latest activist to be convicted under Turkey’s broad anti-terrorism laws. A forensic expert, she has spent much of her career documenting torture and ill-treatment, and has served as president of the Human Rights Foundation of Turkey.

NATO SECRETARY-GENERAL BELIEVES IT'S TIME FOR SWEDEN TO JOIN THE MILITARY ALLIANCE

During her trial, Fincanci rejected accusations that she engaged in propaganda during the interview, arguing that she gave a professional opinion.

Speaking to reporters outside prison following her release, Fincanci further justified her comments.

""Of course, as physicians we will prioritize human health,"" she said. ""We will be against wars and we will do our best to prevent all kinds of weapons, to prevent their use, to eliminate them.""

The charges stemmed from an interview she gave to the pro-Kurdish Medya Haber TV outlet and commented on a video purporting to show the use of chemical weapons. She suggested that a toxic gas may have been released but also called for an ""effective investigation.""

TURKEY'S PENDING SYRIA INVASION MOTIVATED BY POLITICS, NOT SECURITY CONCERNS, EXPERTS SAY

Turkish officials strongly denied allegations that the country used chemical weapons, insisting its military doesn’t have such weapons in its inventory. The PKK has led an armed insurgency against the Turkish state since 1984. The group is considered a terrorist organization in Turkey, Europe and the United States.

Her comments caused a backlash with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accusing her of slandering Turkey’s armed forces and of insulting her country ""by speaking the language of the terrorist organization.""

He vowed to introduce measures to clear the Turkish Medical Association and other professional organizations of ""supporters of the terrorist organization."" In October, the justice minister said they were working on new regulations.

Devlet Bahceli, the leader of a nationalist party that is allied with Erdogan’s ruling party, went further and demanded that she be stripped of her Turkish citizenship and the association shut down.

The association, which has around 110,000 members across Turkey, had drawn the ire of government officials for questioning government data and criticizing some measures imposed during the Covid-19 pandemic.

In her final trial statements, Fincanci said the association was the actual target of the investigation, according to the Dokuz8haber website, which monitored the trial. She said freedom of expression and science were being undermined.

A European Union delegation observed the trial on Wednesday, along with rights groups and supporters, in a packed courtroom.

The advocacy group Physicians for Human Rights criticized the court’s verdict.

""Charging physicians who represent the health interests of all Turkish residents with ‘terrorism’ is ludicrous and shameful,"" Dr. Michele Heisler, the group's medical director, said in a statement. ""Instead of saluting Dr. Korur Fincancı’s courageous and visionary work, the Turkish authorities have attempted to intimidate, punish, and criminalize her and other physicians’ work. The harassment must cease.""

The Istanbul court sentenced her to two years, eight months and 15 days in prison. She is expected to appeal the verdict.

"UN envoy thanks Hezbollah terror group, draws rebuke from Israeli officials: 'Is this real?'","A United Nations official on Monday thanked a representative of Hezbollah for giving her a ""tour d’horizon"" of Lebanese issues, drawing a rebuke from Israeli officials.

Joanna Wronecka, the U.N.’s special coordinator for Lebanon, tweeted her thanks to Ammar Moussawi, head of international relations for Hezbollah, which is designated as a terrorist organization by the State Department.

""I thank Mr. Ammar Moussawi of Hizbullah (sic) for a tour d’horizon on issues of priority for #Lebanon, including the election of a new President, the functioning of state institutions and the impact of regional and international developments on the country,"" Wronecka wrote.

Several Israeli officials criticized the tweet.

""Is this real..??,"" wrote Joshua Zarka, head of strategic affairs in Israel’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. ""An official Senior UN Representative thanks the terrorist organization responsible for the murder of a UN peace keeper for ‘a tour d’horizon’!!!""

""So how does it feel to be indoctrinated by a terrorist? Care to share with us?"" asked Yaki Lopez, head of public diplomacy at Israel’s embassy in Berlin.

UN punishes official who slammed Palestinian terror group's missile attacks into Israel,"The United Nations last week disciplined an employee who works with Palestinians in disputed territories for her tweet condemning the Iranian regime-backed Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) and its ""indiscriminate"" missile fire into Israel.

The U.N. removed Jerusalem-based Sarah Muscroft from her post as the head of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in the Occupied Palestinian Territory because she tweeted: ""Relieved to see a ceasefire agreed ending hostilities impacting both Palestinians and Israeli civilians. Such indiscriminate rocket fire of Islamic Jihad provoking Israeli retaliation is condemned. The safety of all civilians is paramount—the ceasefire must be upheld.""

Israel’s ambassador to the world body, Gilad Erdan, on Sunday sent a letter to U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres requesting that Muscroft be reinstated.

AFTER ISRAEL HITS TERROR GROUP, UN SECURITY COUNCIL MEETS AS SOME MEMBERS REBUKE THE JEWISH STATE

""This norm effectively grants the Palestinian players and the local U.N. staff an ‘unwritten veto’ over U.N. statements, and stands in clear contradiction with the basic principles of objectivity and neutrality that the U.N. claims to hold,"" wrote Erdan.

Palestinian activists launched a campaign to oust Muscroft, who responded by apologizing and deleting her Twitter account. ""One of my previous tweets was ill-informed and I have deleted it"" Muscroft wrote, adding ""I sincerely apologize for my poor judgment. All civilians—everywhere—must be able to live in peace.""

Hillel Neuer, the executive director of UN Watch, told Fox News Digital.

""Muscroft’s groveling apology—for having rightly condemned the Islamic Jihad terrorist organization firing 1,100 rockets aimed at Israel—failed to appease the angry mob. The U.N., which is notoriously slow to act in genuine cases of employee misconduct, rushed to delete her Twitter account, and then remove her from the post.""

Fox News Digital asked Muscroft's employer the reasons for her reassignment and whether she would be reinstated. Jens Laerke, a spokesman for the U.N. office for the coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), said only that she would ""be assigned to a new role.""

Laerke continued, ""OCHA has been present in the occupied Palestinian territory for the past 20 years, working to help meet humanitarian needs, guided by the humanitarian principles of neutrality, impartiality and humanity. Over 2 million people in the occupied Palestinian territory need assistance - they remain our only focus and priority.""

REPUBLICANS PUSH BACK AGAINST BIDEN MOVES TO FUND CONTROVERSIAL UN PALESTINIAN REFUGEE AGENCY

Neuer noted Muscroft's case is not without precedent citing an example involving a United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) employee. ""Likewise, last year UNRWA's Matthias Schmale said IDF strikes on Hamas were precise. Hamas protested, so UNRWA fired him. UNRWA Deputy Chief Leni Stenseth met with Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, ‘affirmed her solidarity’ and called Schmale’s words ‘indefensible.""’

Neuer said ""The UN's message is crystal clear: any official who dares to publicly defy the false narrative of Hamas and Islamic Jihad will be removed.""

Palestinian Islamic Jihad is based in the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip located on the southern border of Israel. The U.S. has classified PIJ and Hamas as foreign terrorist organizations.

UN COMMISSION'S 'ANTISEMITIC' MOVE PROMPTS DEMANDS FOR BIDEN TO DISBAND ANTI-ISRAEL GROUP

The U.N.’s alleged bias toward the Jewish state was also cited in Erdan’s letter. ""We recently witnessed a clear case in which a U.N. official who clearly breached the principles of impartiality and neutrality required from a member of an HRC Commission of Inquiry used clear antisemitic vicious parlance, and yet still maintains his position.""

Israel’s ambassador continued ""HRC [Human Rights Council] Commissioner Miloon Kothari's interview, where he clearly stated that the Jewish lobby controls the social media, should have been met with a firm response that would have led to his resignation,"" he said.

Erdan concluded that ""While Israel supports constructive engagement with U.N. officials and agencies, we cannot accept such blatant double standards.""
