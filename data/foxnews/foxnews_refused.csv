"Controversial Hollywood stars not stripped of Oscars, others who refused acceptance of Academy Award","In the rippling wake of Will Smith’s reaction to Chris Rock’s joke about his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith’s shaved head at the 94th Academy Awards on Sunday, many are calling for the organization to strip Smith of his coveted golden statue.

The actor took home the best actor award for his portrayal of Venus and Serena Williams’ father, Richard Williams in ""King Richard,"" and what was supposed to be a grandiose night of celebration for his performance has since turned into a loud cry for Smith to have the honor rescinded as punishment for the slap, which was seen by millions across the world.

A number of stars in Hollywood have taken sides on how they feel about the incident including comedian Jim Carrey, who said he was ""sickened"" by the moment,"" and show co-host Wanda Sykes, who told Ellen DeGeneres that she was disappointed with the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' decision to allow Smith to accept his award, describing the move as ""gross.""

The Academy has since claimed that they asked Smith to leave, but he refused. They also said Wednesday that they're having ""disciplinary proceedings.""

Podcast host and comedian Joe Rogan also slammed Smith for slapping Rock and questioned the Academy for letting him accept the award and give an extended speech.

""It sets a terrible precedent in so many different ways,"" Rogan said during Tuesday's episode of his podcast, the ""Joe Rogan Experience.""

AFTER CHRIS ROCK-WILL SMITH INCIDENT, ACADEMY SETS BOARD OF GOVERNORS MEETING: WHAT IS IT AND WHAT CAN HAPPEN?

""It sets a terrible precedent for comedy clubs. Like, are people going to decide to go on stage and smack a comedian now?

""It's a rare instance that someone so enormously famous and successful like Will Smith that they literally still allowed him to not just win the Academy Award, but also go up and accept it and give a speech after he assaulted a small comedian on stage,"" he added.

WILL SMITH’S ‘BAD BOYS’ DIRECTOR MICHAEL BAY, OTHER CELEBS REACT TO CHRIS ROCK OSCARS SLAP

However, in years past, the Academy has actually gone the full length as to take back an Oscar nomination for infractions against its code of conduct, which it revised in 2017 amid the fallout of the #MeToo era.

In a letter to Academy members at the time, CEO Dawn Hudson wrote that ""membership is a privilege offered to only a select few within the global community of filmmakers."" She added that ""there is no place in the Academy for people who misuse their status, power or influence in a manner that violates standards of decency.""

Here are some notable performers and directors whose Academy Award recognitions were refused, rescinded and a few who still hold Oscars in their possession.

HARVEY WEINSTEIN

Disgraced director and former Miramax head honcho Harvey Weinstein, who has been convicted of rape, is still in possession of his best picture Academy Award for 1998's ""Shakespeare in Love."" Additionally, through his company productions, Weinstein has had hand in producing 81 Oscar wins.

Weinstein is already serving a 23-year sentence in New York for rape and sexual assault , faces 11 counts in California, including rape and sexual battery involving five incidents that allegedly took place between 2004 and 2013. If convicted, he faces up to 140 years behind bars .

ROMAN POLANSKI

The Polish-French ""Chinatown"" director, 88, who pleaded guilty to statutory rape, has never returned to the United States since fleeing the country in 1978 ahead of his sentencing.

ROMAN POLANSKI BLAMES THE MEDIA FOR ‘TRYING TO MAKE' HIM 'INTO A MONSTER’

The ""Pianist"" filmmaker won the 2003 best director Oscar but was not present to accept the trophy. He remains on the run from justice in Europe for allegedly raping a 13-year-old girl in the U.S. about 40 years ago.

MEL GIBSON

Meanwhile, actor Mel Gibson — who has displayed a history of anti-Semitic remarks — also still has his 1996 Oscar wins for best picture and best director when he took home the honors for ""Braveheart.""

In December 2021, "" Scandal "" actor Joshua Malina even declared that cancel culture does not exist as long as the ""Lethal Weapon"" performer can continue to have a career.

""If Gibson is welcomed back to direct the latest installment of this beloved franchise, it may be time to stop publishing think pieces about the power of ‘cancel culture,’"" Malina wrote in an op-ed for The Atlantic at the time. ""Because if he can continue to find big bucks and approbation in Hollywood, cancel culture simply does not exist.""

Gibson's incidents include the actor’s 2006 detention by a police officer for alleged drunk driving that led to an anti-Semitic rant directed at the officer, who was Jewish.

Later, infamous voicemails in 2010 heard Gibson using racist and misogynistic language directed at then-girlfriend Oksana Grigorieva and his "" no contest "" plea to charges of domestic battery against her the following year.

OTHER CONTROVERSIAL OSCAR MOMENTS

""HONDO""

The 1953 John Wayne film was nominated for best story (now best original screenplay) only to have its recognition taken away after the film’s script was found to not have been original and was based on an already-existing storyline.

MARLON BRANDO DECLINES OSCAR WIN

At the 1973 Oscars, the ""Godfather"" actor didn’t accept his Academy Award for best actor for his performance in Francis Ford Coppola's mafia flick, instead electing to have Sacheen Littlefeather — who at the time was president of the National Native American Affirmative Image Committee — accept the honor on Brando’s behalf.

She said the actor could not accept the award because ""of the treatment of American Indians today by the film industry and on television in movie reruns.""

SACHEEN LITTLEFEATHER, WHO REJECTED MARLON BRANDO’S OSCAR IN 1973, SAYS SHE WAS BLACKLISTED BY HOLLYWOOD

Littlefeather was admonished in real-time while giving her speech but persisted through the loud boos filling the room.

""I beg at this time that I have not intruded on this evening, and that … in the future our hearts and our understandings will meet with love and generosity,"" Littlefeather added as she rejected the Academy Award for Brando.

"Prince William refused to attend lunch with Prince Harry amid ‘Megxit,’ royal expert claims","Earlier this year, Prince William refused to attend a lunch with his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, and his younger brother Prince Harry to clear the air and heal the alleged rift within the British royal family.

The claim was made by royal biographer Robert Lacey, who is also the official consultant on Netflix’s “The Crown.” The British historian, 76, is releasing a new book titled “Battle of Brothers: William and Harry - The Inside Story of a Family in Tumult,” which addresses the ongoing woes impacted by the royal family.

The book will also put the two brothers’ relationship into a historical context, exploring how the “heir” and the “spare” have impacted the British monarchy over the years. It features numerous interviews with palace insiders.

During a recent appearance on True Royalty TV’s weekly program “The Royal Beat,” Lacey claimed that things were so bad between the brothers following Harry stepping back as a senior royal with his wife Meghan Markle – or ""Megxit"" – that William turned down a lunch invitation from the queen to avoid spending extra time with the Sussexes.

QUEEN ELIZABETH STEPS OUT WITH PRINCE WILLIAM FOR FIRST PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT SINCE MARCH

“It infuriated William to the extent that when the queen said, ‘Alright, let’s have a meeting to talk about all this. Beforehand we will have a family lunch to talk things over, William actually said, ‘No, I do not want to come to the lunch. I will come and negotiate the over the table,’” Lacey claimed in a clip sent to Fox News on Monday.

“But he would not sit down at the family lunch with Harry.” Lacey alleged.

Lacey said that if William is ultimately given the role of the Head of the Royal Marines, “that will mark the rift.”

“I think that they have kept that position open for [Harry] if he wants to come back into the family,” Lacey explained. “If they are going to give it to William, I think that is the end of [the relationship between the boys].”

PRINCE HARRY QUESTIONED PRINCE WILLIAM'S 'CONCERN FOR' MEGHAN MARKLE BEFORE MARRIAGE: REPORT

Rumors of an alleged royal feud came to light in 2019, when British bestselling author Katie Nicholl claimed that since Markle, 39 and Harry, 36 announced their engagement in 2017, William, 38, grew increasingly worried for his brother and his whirlwind romance with the American actress.

“William was quite concerned that the relationship had moved so quickly,” Nicholl claimed in the TLC documentary “Kate V. Meghan: Princesses at War?”. “And being close to Harry, you know, probably the only person close enough to say to Harry, ‘This seems to be moving quickly. Are you sure?’ And I think what was meant as well intended brotherly advice just riled Harry.”

“Harry is hugely protective of Meghan,” Nicholl continued. “He saw that as criticism, he interpreted that as his brother not really being behind this marriage, this union. And I don’t think things have been quite right ever since.”

Lacey said William had every right to be cautious.

MEGHAN MARKLE LEARNED ‘THERE IS NO PLACE FOR SOMEONE WITH POLITICAL AMBITION’ IN THE BRITISH ROYAL FAMILY

“Meghan is a self-made woman,” he said. “She becomes a star, she becomes a self-made millionaire. I think that when William sat down with Harry and said there could be problems, I think events have proven him right.”

“I think that [Meghan] has come to realize how [some of her] speeches risk her husband’s relationship with the family and perhaps she may pedal back on some of these more extreme positions,” said Lacey.

The U.K.’s Evening Standard noted that in recent weeks, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have been accused of interfering in the U.S. presidential election by urging Americans to vote.

Traditionally, the British royals don’t vote in elections, and “The Queen has to remain strictly neutral with respect to political matters,"" according to the monarch’s website. However, according to People magazine, there is no law forbidding it.

KATE MIDDLETON, PRINCE WILLIAM'S SON PRINCE LOUIS, 2, SPEAKS PUBLICLY IN RARE VIDEO

Lacey told “The Royal Beat” that he found Harry and the former “Suits” star “too preachy” and claimed William does more for some progressive causes than his brother and sister-in-law.

“People have said the Windsors don’t do ‘woke,’” he explained. “They don’t know how to handle progressive causes. However, I think William does it rather well. He does it better than Meghan and Harry.”

After notoriously stepping down as senior members of the British royal family at the start of the year and moving to North America, the Sussexes have recently settled down in Santa Barbara, Calif., after stints of living in Los Angeles and Vancouver, Canada.

A rep for the couple confirmed to Fox News that they purchased a home in the coastal city.

PRINCE WILLIAM, KATE MIDDLETON’S BIRTHDAY POST FOR PRINCE HARRY LEAVE ROYAL FANS DIVIDED

""The Duke and Duchess of Sussex moved into their family home in July of this year,"" a spokesperson said. ""They have settled into the quiet privacy of their community since their arrival and hope that this will be respected for their neighbors, as well as them as a family.""

A source told Page Six, who first reported the news, that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex hope this is where their son, Archie, 1, can grow up and lead ""as normal a life as possible.”

Previously, Harry hinted at an alleged rift with his older brother in last year’s ITV documentary “Harry & Meghan: An African Journey.”

“Part of this role and part of this job, this family, being under the pressure that it’s under, inevitably stuff happens,” he said at the time. “But look, we’re brothers, we’ll always be brothers. We’re certainly on different paths at the moment but I’ll always be there for him and I know he’ll always be there for me.”",https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/prince-william-refused-to-attend-lunch-prince-harry-robert-lacey-true-royalty-tv,N/A
Ronan Farrow throws shade at NBC News while revealing 'dark side' of Weinstein-friendly media,"Ronan Farrow cast more shade on NBC News on Tuesday, launching a Twitter storm that suggested the network sought to shut down his reporting on sex abuses by Harvey Weinstein and even threatened his NBC producer with losing his job.

“My reporting is only possible because of a group of brave journalists who fought for the story,” Farrow tweeted in the first of a 10-message thread that praised the prestigious New Yorker magazine which published his investigations of Weinstein.

“.@RichMcHughNBC, my wonderful producer, refused to bow to pressure to stop, through numerous shoots, even when it meant risking his job,” Farrow went on to say in his Twitter storm. Multiple press accounts of NBC’s decision to pass on Farrow’s reporting on Weinstein described the NBC News investigative producer, Rich McHugh, as disappointed that NBC shut down his and Farrow’s reporting on Weinstein.

NBC did not respond to questions about Farrow’s tweet storm.

Farrow’s latest bombshell report regarding Weinstein was published in The New Yorker on Monday, claiming that Weinstein used a network of Israeli ex-spies and other investigators working in concert with New York super lawyers to try to shut down various journalistic exposés in the works on Weinstein’s treatment of women. On Tuesday, the celebrity scion had nothing but praise for his New Yorker editors and fact checker who “championed” and “protected” him.

Farrow’s bosses at NBC, by contrast, had told him to take his initial Weinstein bombshell elsewhere, claiming it wasn’t good enough for the network.

To add insult to injury, Farrow, whose Twitter bio currently describes him as an NBC reporter and “Today” show correspondent, appeared Tuesday morning on “Good Morning America,” arch-rival of the “Today” show, during the crucial November “sweeps” period. “GMA” described Farrow as a New Yorker contributor and mentioned NBC only when co-host George Stephanopoulos asked Farrow if Weinstein “got to” NBC when it decided to spike the original story.

“I think the story makes it clear [Weinstein and his team] were focusing on everyone trying to get word out about this,” Farrow said carefully.

NBC News did not respond when asked how it felt about Farrow appearing on its bitter rival.

The relationship between Farrow and NBC is almost as confusing as why the network killed the Weinstein story in the first place. NBC News declined comment when Fox News asked if Farrow is still paid or has a freelance relationship with the network. Farrow, who also did not respond to request for clarification, has been very active on the Twitter account that says in its bio that he works at NBC.

The former MSNBC host also threw his network under the bus on “The Rachel Maddow Show” when his first Weinstein article was published last month. Hours after his story was published, he told Maddow that The New Yorker “immediately” realized his story was reportable and “there were multiple determinations” that NBC had enough to run it.

On Tuesday, Farrow tweeted that New Yorker editor David Remnick “saved” his story as a “rare bastion of journalistic integrity,” and digital editor David Rohde “was a compassionate, thoughtful and tireless editor” on the pair on Weinstein bombshells.

As for Farrow’s reportedly embattled NBC producer, Rich McHugh, NBC News did not immediately respond when asked if McHugh’s job was actually at risk, or if Farrow is lying.

McHugh did not immediately respond to Fox News’ request for comment.

Last month, embattled NBC News President Noah Oppenheim faced public pressure to step down after it was revealed that he killed Farrow’s long-gestating investigation that would have outed Weinstein as a sexual predator months before the New Yorker published Farrow’s story.

NBC News has denied that Oppenheim has ties to Weinstein, but the NBC News president moonlights as a Hollywood screenwriter and the two men recently shared a relatively small table at a swanky media event.

“This story shows dark side of how media treats powerful men but also reminds us brave people are still defending the truth,” Farrow wrote on Tuesday, praising the New Yorker.

After Oppenheim’s NBC spiked Farrow’s initial report, he eventually took the story to The New Yorker, which is known for its fact checking and high editorial standards.

Oppenheim, then under siege, contended during a private NBC News event last month that the “incredible story” Farrow published in the New Yorker was “not the story that we were looking at when we made our judgment several months ago.”

On “Maddow” last month, Farrow essentially accused Oppenheim of lying, saying The New Yorker “immediately” realized his story was reportable and “there were multiple determinations” that NBC had enough to run it.

CNN reported that a source called NBC’s decision “indefensible” and longtime New Yorker media critic Ken Auletta said it’s a “scandal.” NBC has strenuously denied that Oppenheim had any conflict of interest.

The Weinstein contretemps is the latest embarrassment for NBC News, which a year ago also sat on the notorious “Access Hollywood” tape of Donald Trump making lewd comments about women to future “Today” co-host Billy Bush. At the time NBC was sitting on the tape, Oppenheim was overseeing “Today.” The tape was eventually leaked to the Washington Post’s David Fahrenthold, who is Oppenheim’s friend from prestigious Harvard University. Bush was fired after the tape became public, and Oppenheim was soon thereafter promoted to NBC News president.

While some NBC insiders say it may be the best scenario for everyone involved if Oppenheim steps down, another NBC insider told Fox News that powerful NBC News chairman Andy Lack – to whom much of NBC’s news operations report directly – was ultimately responsible for the Weinstein debacle. Lack has been conspicuously silent about the Weinstein story.

Meanwhile, the The New York Post has reported that “major networks are fighting” over signing Farrow, who is reportedly “dragging his feet to sign another exclusive deal” after his relationship with NBC went sour. Farrow was initially hired by NBC in 2014 to great fanfare as host of a liberal daytime MSNBC show, which was quickly canceled due to poor ratings. He had been largely adrift at NBC for some time until he started working on his Weinstein project.",https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/ronan-farrow-throws-shade-at-nbc-news-while-revealing-dark-side-of-weinstein-friendly-media,N/A

"Will Smith's Oscars slap prompts academy disciplinary proceedings, star reportedly refused to leave ceremony","The Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences has launched ""disciplinary proceedings"" against Will Smith after the ""King Richard"" star slapped presenter Chris Rock at the Oscars Sunday.

""The Board of Governors today initiated disciplinary proceedings against Mr. Smith for violations of the academy’s standards of conduct, including inappropriate physical contact, abusive or threatening behavior and compromising the integrity of the academy,"" a statement obtained by Fox News Digital says.

""Mr. Smith was asked to leave the ceremony and refused, [but] we also recognize we could have handled the situation differently.""

CHRIS ROCK SPOTTED FOR FIRST TIME SINCE NIGHT OF WILL SMITH'S OSCARS SLAP

Penalties from the academy range from ""suspension, expulsion or other sanctions permitted by the bylaws and standards of conduct.""

Many have focused on why Smith was allowed to remain seated in the front row at the Academy Awards after the incident. On Wednesday, the academy said it attempted to remove the actor from the audience.

WILL SMITH WAS ALMOST ‘REMOVED’ FROM OSCARS AFTER VIRAL CHRIS ROCK SMACK: REPORT

""Things unfolded in a way we could not have anticipated,"" the academy said. ""While we would like to clarify that Mr. Smith was asked to leave the ceremony and refused, we also recognize we could have handled the situation differently.""

A representative for the academy declined to give specifics on how it tried to removed Smith. After Smith struck Rock in response to a joke about wife Jada Pinkett Smith, several stars, including Denzel Washington, Bradley Cooper and Tyler Perry spoke to the 53-year-old Smith.

The academy said Smith has the opportunity to defend himself in a written response before the board meets again April 18. The film academy earlier condemned Smith's onstage assault of Rock, but it used stronger language Wednesday.

""Mr. Smith’s actions at the 94th Oscars were a deeply shocking, traumatic event to witness in-person and on television,"" the academy said. ""Mr. Rock, we apologize to you for what you experienced on our stage, and thank you for your resilience in that moment.

Smith has since publicly apologized to Rock after he slapped the comedian during the Oscars Sunday evening.

""Violence in all of its forms is poisonous and destructive,"" Smith wrote in part on Instagram before publicly apologizing to Rock. ""I was out of line and I was wrong.""

""I am embarrassed and my actions were not indicative of the man I want to be. There is no place for violence in a world of love and kindness.

Smith's full statement: ""My behavior at last night’s Academy Awards was unacceptable and inexcusable. Jokes at my expense are a part of the job, but a joke about Jada’s medical condition was too much for me to bear and I reacted emotionally.""

ACADEMY CONDEMNS WILL SMITH'S ACTIONS, LAUNCHING FORMAL REVIEW OF CHRIS ROCK SLAP

""I would like to publicly apologize to you, Chris. I was out of line and I was wrong. I am embarrassed and my actions were not indicative of the man I want to be. There is no place for violence in a world of love and kindness.

"Chipotle offers to rehire manager who refused to serve black customers over ‘dine and dash’ concerns, citing new evidence","UPDATE, Monday 11/19 3:45 E.T.:

On Monday afternoon, Chipotle Chief Communications Officer Laurie Schalow told Fox News that the company has offered to rehire its terminated manager. The manager was fired last week for refusing to make food for five black customers unless they paid in advance, saying they had failed to pay at the restaurant before. Tweets later emerged showing that at least one member of the customers had boasted about stealing and ""dining and dashing"" from restaurants in the past -- including Chipotle.

Schalow sent the following statement: ""We have spent the last few days reviewing the evidence available to us regarding the incident in St. Paul, MN. Based on our review, we have offered our manager her job back. While our normal protocol was not followed serving these customers, we publicly apologize to our manager for being put in this position. We will work to continue to ensure that we support a respectful workplace for our employees and our customers alike.

Our policy is to treat our customers and employees fairly and with respect at all times and under any circumstances. We will work with all our restaurant teams to ensure they are prepared to handle situations of this kind and know they have our full support. We are committed to doing the right thing and acting in a manner consistent with a thoughtful, fact-driven approach.""

Original story below:

The restaurant chain Chipotle announced Saturday that it had terminated one of its managers for suggesting in a viral video that five black customers were planning to order food without paying -- but on Sunday, the company acknowledged to Fox News that it was considering re-hiring the manager because her suspicions may have been well-founded.

In a series of video clips seen more than 3 million times on Twitter, a Chipotle customer in St. Paul, Minn., identifed as 21-year-old Masud Ali, and several friends are told by a manager: ""You gotta pay, because you’ve never had money when you come in here.” An employee adds, ""We're not gonna make food unless you guys actually have money.""

As Ali and his friends complain about ""stereotypes,"" the videos show employees at the store claiming that the group had previously ordered food on two occasions without paying. The store manager also calls the police in the videos, which were recorded and uploaded by Ali.

In one video clip, the manager smiles and tries to ignore the men while they produce what appears to be cash, as proof that they can pay for their food. One of the employees visible in the kitchen is black.

""It sounded really racist — the way she said it was racist,” Ali told Minnesota's Star Tribune newspaper on Friday. “She asked for proof of income as if I’m getting a loan.” On Twitter, Ali asked Chipotle: ""Can a group of young well-established African-American get a bite to eat after a long workout session?”

Ali also posted the restaurant's phone number and address to social media. Within hours and under a deluge of criticism, Chipotle issued a statement implying that the manager had acted out of bias and announcing her termination.

But on Sunday, as tweets emerged showing that Ali had apparently made a habit of stealing from restaurants, Chipotle walked back its decision.

""Our actions were based on the facts known to us immediately after the incident, including video footage, social media posts and conversations with the customer, manager, and our employees,"" Chipotle Chief Communications Officer Laurie Schalow told Fox News on Sunday. ""We now have additional information which needs to be investigated further. We want to do the right thing, so after further investigation we will re-train and re-hire if the facts warrant it.""

Despite reports on Twitter late Sunday that the manager had received her job back, Chipotle confirmed to Fox News that ""nothing has changed from this morning. We are still investigating a few things.""

""After further investigation we will re-train and re-hire if the facts warrant it."" — Chipotle Chief Communications Officer Laurie Schalow

In a previous statement on Saturday, the company had said: “We are committed to treating all of our customers fairly and with respect. ... Regarding what happened at the St. Paul restaurant, the manager thought these gentlemen were the same customers from Tuesday night who weren’t able to pay for their meal. Regardless, this is not how we treat our customers and as a result, the manager has been terminated and the restaurant is being re-trained to ensure something like this doesn’t happen again.”

In subsequent interviews, though, Chipotle representatives admitted that the manager might have been right in claiming that individuals in the group had ordered food just days before without paying once their order was completed. (As a matter of policy, Chipotle only provides food to customers upon payment, but store employees finish making orders before payment is requested at the register.)

“We are not able to confirm that with 100 percent certainty,” Schalow acknowledged in a statement to The Twin Cities Pioneer Press. “We asked Masud if he was in our restaurant on Tuesday and he said no.”

And almost immediately, it emerged that Ali had apparently spoken favorably of ""dining and dashing"" -- the practice of ordering food and not paying for it -- several times on Twitter in the past.

""aye man i think chopotle catchin up to us fam. should we change locations and yoooooo what should we do about the other thang,"" read a since-deleted post on Ali's account from 2016.

In 2015, he wrote that ""we finna goto Applebees and eat as much as we can and tip the nice lady 20cents and walk the f--- out.""

When another Twitter user objected, he replied that ""we're just borrowing the food for a couple hours"" as opposed to dining and dashing.

Later that year, he opined that ""Dine and dash is forever interesting"" and discussed stealing Tabasco bottles from Chipotle.

Another post read: “Guys we’re borrowing food... that’s it. And if the lady tries to stop you at the door don’t hesitate to truck the sh-- out of that bi---.” Ali has since deleted all of these posts.

""We finna goto Applebees and eat as much as we can and tip the nice lady 20cents and walk the f--- out."" — Masud Ali

As those tweets surfaced over the weekend, Chipotle's media representatives, including Schalow, initially said that they had seen the tweets and would stand by their decision to fire the manager -- seemingly contradicting Schalow's statement to Fox News on Sunday.

According to author Matt Palumbo, Schalow had previously claimed that the store's manager was justifiably terminated because she broke protocol by requiring payment before making the customers' food, regardless of her suspicions about the customers' intention to pay.

Palumbo called Schalow's suggestion that Chipotle had not been aware of Ali's tweets when it fired the manager an ""absolute lie."" (For her part, Schalow has reportedly said that other information -- and not simply Ali's tweets --was behind Chipotle's desire to reconsider the manager's fate.)

""The correct action to take would have been to make their food and not hand it over to them until they paid for it,"" Schalow had asserted as part of her justification for firing the manager, according to Palumbo.

Ali did not respond to Fox News' request for comment.

The episode follows several other high-profile incidents of alleged racism that have rocked the service industry. In May, Starbucks closed 8,000 of its stores for anti-bias training after two black men were arrested for trespassing in one of its Philadelphia shops. The store manager, who stopped working at Starbucks shortly after the episode, had called the police because the men remained seated in the shop without ordering anything, and refused to order something when asked.

Cook Out manager who was fired after cop was refused service says employees followed store policy,"A fast-food restaurant in North Carolina reportedly fired two employees after a police officer was refused service last week, but one of the women who was terminated says there’s much more to the story.

Taren Woods, the on-duty manager at the Cook Out in Roxboro, said she was in the back of the restaurant when Sgt. Kenneth Horton of the Roxboro Police stopped by after midnight on Nov. 7, in uniform. Woods admits she didn’t see the interaction between the cashier and Horton — who was refused service by the cashier — but claims that all employees adhered to the company policy.

According to Woods, who spoke with WNCN, the cashier did refuse to take Sgt. Horton’s order, but excused herself and asked a fellow employee to step in at the register — which Woods says is company policy.

The Cook Out manager said the officer then requested to know why the first cashier wouldn’t help him, before leaving the restaurant.

“I didn’t know … it was that serious until the next day I heard the cashier got fired because she didn’t take the cop’s order,” Woods told WNCN, adding that she only learned that she, too, was fired upon arriving at work the following day.

“[The district manager] told me he had to let me go because I didn’t take control of the situation, saying how I should have gone outside to take the cop’s order,” Woods further alleged. “Mind you it was midnight and policy states that we’re not allowed outside the building after 9:45. So why would I go outside to chase down a cop?”

A representative for Cook Out was not immediately available to confirm Woods’ account, or the stipulations of the store policy.

Roxboro Police had originally shared news of at least one employee’s firing on Monday, after news of Horton’s visit began circulating on social media.

""We're saddened that an employee denied service to a police officer. We promote unity,"" Roxboro Police Chief David Hess told WTVD-TV. ""Unfortunately, it's all because of a small action that could have been avoided.""

Woods, meanwhile, told WTVD-TV she’s angry and “hurt” by her termination, and at the way the story has been reported.

“It is frustrating because it’s a lie,” Woods, a 10-year employee of Cook Out, added in a statement to WNCN. ""And they got all this stuff stirred up. And I lost my job and I got four kids and it’s Christmas time. So yeah, that’s not fair at all.""

Cook Out, which was founded in Greensboro, N.C., operates approximately 250 locations in 10 states.

Intoxicated man blocks entrance to Papa John's after being refused service for not wearing mask,"What this guy needs is some pizza quiet.

A Montana man reportedly caused a recent disturbance at a pizza place over the restaurant’s mask policy. The customer allegedly refused to leave, even after authorities offered to let him take his pizza and go.

Donald Lee Atkinson, Jr. was taken into custody on Saturday night after causing a scene at a Papa John’s in Butte, Mont., the Montana Standard reports. He allegedly entered the establishment with no mask on and refused to wear one.

NJ MAN ARRESTED FOR 'CYBER HARASSMENT' AFTER MAKING FAKE PIZZA ORDERS THAT COST THOUSANDS

Employees reportedly offered to bring out his order so that he wouldn’t have to wear a mask, but Atkinson refused to leave the building. He allegedly held the restaurant’s door shut at one point, making it impossible for other customers to enter.

Authorities arrived on the scene around 9 p.m. and reportedly noted that Atkinson appeared to be intoxicated. According to reports, a pizza was brought to Atkinson and he was told his choices were either to leave the area or be arrested.

He allegedly refused to leave.

Atkinson was jailed at the Butte Detention Center for misdemeanor failure to disperse and misdemeanor disorderly conduct.

This is not the only time a customer has become aggressive while refusing to wear a mask.

Fox News previously reported that Stephen Gould, owner of Golden Moon Speakeasy in Colorado, claimed that an angry patron — who has since been identified as 62-year-old John Roche — became combative after an employee asked him to comply with Golden’s current mask ordinance.

Police later charged Roche with trespassing and harassment, saying it was “clear … that he was intending to harass, annoy or alarm this victim.”

Police say if found guilty, each count of trespassing and harassment carries fines of up to $2,650 and 180 days in jail.

McDonald's employee fired for refusing service to police officer; cop's wife says husband was 'humiliated',"The wife of a Virginia police officer is speaking out about the McDonald’s employee who refused to serve him, but she claims she never wanted the young employee to lose his job.

Last week, Officer Scott Naff of the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries was denied service by a young McDonald’s drive-thru worker, who took one look at Naff in his uniform and stated, “I ain’t serving no cops.”

“My husband, of course, was shocked,” said Cathy Naff during an interview on Friday morning’s edition of “Fox and Friends.”

DETROIT RESTAURANT UNDER FIRE FOR 'SEXUALLY SUGGESTIVE' MESSAGE ON UNIFORMS

“He said, ‘I’m sorry, what did you say?’ And [the employee] said, ‘I ain’t serving no police,’ and he closed the window on my husband, and stepped away from the window.”

Officer Naff, who had already paid for his food, waited patiently for the issue to be resolved, though his wife Cathy believes he was humiliated by the situation.

“People who were working in the restaurant were peeking around the corner, staring at my husband, making him feel very humiliated, I believe, at that point,” stated Cathy, who first shared her husband’s story on Facebook last week. “Finally, what seemed to be a cook from the back of the restaurant came around to the window and handed him his food.”

In response to last week’s incident, the manager of that McDonald’s said she “regret[s] the situation as it goes against our standards of providing a welcoming experience to everyone.” She also wrote that the restaurant has “taken the appropriate action to resolve the situation.”

Despite this, Cathy said she and her husband had never requested that the young man be dismissed from his position.

“Well, for my husband and for myself, the last thing in the world we want to see is someone lose their job … for him to lose his job, of course, is very disheartening.”

Instead, Cathy said that, in the future, she’d rather see McDonald’s expend more effort to train its employees in better customer service practices.

“We would really like to see some of the appropriate action being taken from McDonald’s, and working with their training programs and working with their hiring practices to ensure that anyone who comes to one of their stores is treated with the utmost respect,” said Cathy.

Still, Cathy says she and her husband haven’t ruled out a visit to McDonald’s altogether.

“As we know, there are so many great franchise owners out there who are working with their employees on a daily basis to teach them the customer service skills that they need,” she said.

“I guess that’s up for us to make that decision in the future.”",https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/mcdonalds-employee-fired-for-refusing-service-to-police-officer-cops-wife-says-husband-was-humiliated,N/A

"Baby died after parents refused treatment for jaundice, police say","A Michigan couple who attempted to pray for their newborn daughter’s health rather than seek medical attention have been charged with involuntary manslaughter in connection to the infant’s death. Rachel Joy Piland, 30, and, Joshua Piland, 36, were reportedly warned by a midwife about their daughter’s jaundice and the potential for brain damage or death, The Lansing State Journal reported.

A detective testified that rather than seek medical help, Rachel Piland replied that “God makes no mistakes.”

Rachel Piland had delivered their daughter, Abigail, at the family’s home on Feb. 6 with the help of a midwife, the news outlet reported. The next day, the midwife allegedly warned Rachel about Abigail’s health, and advised she be taken to a pediatrician or the hospital. Rachel then canceled an appointment with the midwife for Feb. 8.

MOM FACING JAIL OVER REFUSAL TO VACCINATE SON

Rachel’s mother, Rebecca Kerr, reportedly observed that the infant’s skin color was off, and then observed blood coming from the baby’s nose. Detective Peter Scaccia testified that Kerr wanted to call for help on Feb. 9, but “Rachel would not allow her,” and instead went upstairs to pray, The Lansing State Journal reported.

The baby was found lifeless in a bouncy seat later that morning, and Joshua attempted “one rescue breath but had no success,” Scaccia said. Joshua allegedly did not want to perform CPR on the child because he only knew protocol for adults.

“They then brought Abigail upstairs to pray for her. Joshua continued to massage Abigail, attempting to get her good air,” Scaccia testified, according to the news outlet. “Both Josh and (Rachel) reached out to friends and fellow church members to come to their home and pray for Abigail’s resurrection, but never called the police.”

WOMAN ACCUSED IN PLOT TO KILL NIECE WITH POISONED BREAST MILK

Scaccia said a call to authorities was placed by Rachel’s brother, who lives in California. A medical examiner later determined Abigail died from unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and kernicterus, and attributed both to the infant’s jaundice. He said she would be alive if the parents had sought treatment, the news outlet reported.

They were each charged with a single count of involuntary manslaughter and released after posting bond. The next hearing is scheduled for Oct. 5, with each facing up to 15 years in jail if convicted.",https://www.foxnews.com/health/baby-died-after-parents-refused-treatment-for-jaundice-police-say,N/A
Mom who refused to abort baby with medical needs welcomes daughter: 'I was terrified of losing her',"After suffering several miscarriages, Kiera Meldrum, 20, was delighted to learn she was pregnant again in July 2018. But roughly five months into her pregnancy, the United Kingdom woman was told her unborn daughter was suffering from a serious medical condition that spurred doctors to recommend abortion.

But Meldrum, of York, refused … fourteen times, she claims.

'PREGNANT' WOMAN'S 'BABY BUMP' WAS ACTUALLY CANCEROUS GROWTH

“I refused to terminate Lillee-Rose every time they told me to, and I'm so happy I listened to my heart instead of the doctors,” Meldrum told SWNS of her now 6-month-old daughter.

Doctors told Meldrum her child had Grade 3 severe ascites to the bowel, a condition that causes an abnormal buildup of fluid in the abdomen. The mother was told Lillee-Rose was suffering from the condition at her 21-week scan.

""I felt sick when they told me she wasn't well, but I just knew my little girl was a fighter and that she could make it,” she recalled. ""There was no way I was terminating my pregnancy — I'd waited so long to become a mom and I was determined to do all I could to protect my baby.""

At 28 weeks, the baby’s bowel ruptured— prompting doctors to recommend an abortion once more, the mom said. Amniotic fluid was also building up inside Meldrum, causing her immense pain.

“My stomach swelled up enormously, and it felt like I was carrying a giant painful water balloon against my tummy. Doctors said that draining the fluid could hurt my baby, and after being told how poorly she already was, I knew I couldn't do anything risky,” she told SWNS.

""I was in constant pain, but I had to do everything I could to protect my baby or I'd never forgive myself.""

In February, Meldrum went into labor and gave birth to her daughter at 34 weeks. The little girl, who weighed just over 4 pounds when she was born, required emergency surgery shortly after to repair her ruptured bowel, her mother said.

“I was terrified of losing her and watching them whisk her straight away from me and into surgery broke my heart,” she said.

Lillee-Rose was required to stay in an incubator at Leeds Teaching Hospitals for the first eight weeks of her life. Finally, following a second surgery, she was given permission to go home.

A doctor at the hospital told SWNS Lillee-Rose suffered from a rare birth defect called jejunal atresia with ascites, “which affects between 1-3 babies in every 10,000 born and requires complex specialist surgery to correct.”

Though the young girl will require check-ups every few months to ensure her bowel is healing and functioning properly, her mother said she’s doing well and getting stronger each day.

“Doctors told me every week to terminate my pregnancy, and hearing that advice over and over again was horrific, but something told me Lillee-Rose would make it through,” she said. ""My baby girl never stopped fighting and finally having her home with me is a blessing. She's my little miracle.""",https://www.foxnews.com/health/mom-refuses-abortion-daughter,N/A
Parents fight insurance company to keep baby's cancer surgery docs,"next Image 1 of 2

A Texas Army veteran whose baby has a life-threatening brain tumor is battling her insurance company over its last-minute refusal to pay for an operation at the acclaimed hospital that's been treating the child.

Savannah Snodgrass was just four months old in March, when doctors discovered the tumor in her left temporal lobe and sent her to Texas Children's Hospital. Deeming Savannah too young and fragile for brain surgery, doctors monitored her closely only to find the tumor growing. This week, the team of specialists there ordered emergency surgery to be performed on Tuesday, but the operation was scuttled when Superior HealthPlan, a Texas-based HMO, wrote a letter to Tessa Snodgrass denying coverage at the hospital.

""I was shocked,"" Snodgrass, of Georgetown, Texas, told FoxNews.com. ""You don’t expect something like this to ever happen. I was absolutely stunned because they had been sending us to Texas Children's all this time.""

Snodgrass, a 38-year-old mother of four and retired U.S. Army major, said it all started when Savannah began having seizures in March. She was first taken to her pediatrician who ordered she be admitted to a hospital in Temple, Texas, after she had 15 seizures in a 24-hour period, her mother said.

Doctors there referred the Snodgrasses to Texas Children's Hospital where doctors mapped out the plan to monitor the tumor closely while allowing for Savannah to grow in size before operating.

An MRI conducted two weeks ago confirmed the worst: the tumor had grown substantially, leading doctors to suspect malignancy and order emergency surgery to remove and biopsy the mass, the family said.

Snodgrass claims Superior HealthPlan had been covering Savannah's care all along -- including pre-approval for another MRI to be conducted on Monday.

But in a ""stunning"" turn of events, Snodgrass claims the company refused to pay for Savannah's brain surgery scheduled for Tuesday, claiming in a June 27 letter that Texas Children's Hospital is an out-of-network provider and referring her instead to a surgical facility in Austin, about an hour south of Georgetown.

Snodgrass believes her daughter's best chance lies with the doctors at Texas Children's, who have been tending to her for months.

""It's rare for a tumor to be found in a child this young,"" she said. ""It so clearly called for a neurosurgeon specialized in operating on babies -- not just any surgeon.""

""The average national survival rate for infants for this surgery is 47 percent. At Texas Children's Hospital, survival rate is close to 90 percent,"" Snodgrass said. ""Would you accept less than a 50-50 survival rate when you can have almost 100 percent?""

""If we had more notice, we could have changed plans months ago,"" she said.

In an e-mail to FoxNews.com, Superior HealthPlan said it is ""confident"" the family will find capable in-network providers.

""Paramount to Superior HealthPlan is helping our members achieve positive health outcomes,"" the insurance company said a statement Wednesday. ""We are sensitive to the complex and timely concerns of this family and are actively working with them to ensure their daughter receives the highest quality of care.

""While we cannot disclose the details of this case due to privacy rules, we are confident that our in-network providers – including Dell Children’s Hospital – have the expertise and resources to give each member the individual care they need,"" the company said. ""We too want the best for this child and will continue to do everything in our power to assist the family in this endeavor. “

Snodgrass, who served two deployments in Iraq, said she's been insured by the company for almost two years. She claimed that after a lengthy delay with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, she finally received a medical retirement plan from the military for injuries she sustained in combat but said that plan, which would cover her family, will not take effect until August.",https://www.foxnews.com/health/parents-fight-insurance-company-to-keep-babys-cancer-surgery-docs,N/A
"Colorado dog sitter refused to return pet to owner, police say","Only hire people you know and trust as pet-sitters.

A Colorado police department helped a local dog owner retrieve their beloved pet from a dog sitter who was refusing to return the animal. Fortunately, the authorities were able to convince the sitter to drop the animal off at the Humane Society.

Realtor says client refused to work with her because she's an amputee: 'This was tough',"A realtor and two-time Paralympian is speaking out after she said a potential client refused to work with her because she’s an amputee.

Last month, Michelle Salt, a realtor in Calgary, Canada, posted her experience on Facebook describing what transpired as she met a potential client for a showing. That client, Salt said, had initially contacted her through her website.

In her Facebook post, Salt wrote: ""My heart hurts today. Recently, I went to show a house and when the client who was a lead through my website (hadn’t met yet), saw that I was an amputee, he drove away.""

""I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt but when I asked why he left, he said he prefers to work with someone without a disability,"" Salt continued in her post. ""Disability whaaa?! Half the time I forget I’m missing a leg.""

Salt told Fox News Digital in an email that after the man drove away, she waited five minutes and called her client, who confirmed that he was the man who drove away because he ""preferred to not work with someone with a disability,"" Salt said.

Salt said she told the man that she was ""sorry he feels that way and all the best in the future.""

US PARALYMPIC GOLD MEDALIST SAYS SHE’S BEING EXCLUDED FROM COMPETING IN BEIJING

""I was shocked as me being an amputee does not affect my ability to do my job whatsoever,"" she told Fox. ""I called my boyfriend right after and couldn't believe what had just happened. As a retired Paralympian, I'm used to my uniqueness being celebrated and appreciated. To have someone not give me a chance was disheartening.""

She added: ""I have never directly dealt with this kind of discrimination. The people around me know that I work hard and love what I do so this was tough.""

Salt lost her leg in a motorcycle accident in 2011. She told Fox she was 26 at the time and before that, she ""also had a lack of understanding of what amputees or anyone living with a disability, were capable of.""

In 2014, Salt competed as a snowboarder Winter Paralympics in Sochi, Russia, and again in the 2018 Winter Paralympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea.

Salt said she had ""very positive and encouraging"" responses after sharing her story with her 170,000 Facebook followers. She also heard from some people who said they have had similar experiences.

""As an amputee myself, I see this kind of behavior every now and again,"" one Facebook user wrote.

Another commented, ""Breaks my heart ‘cause I get it. I had someone recently tell me they could never date me because the fact that I’m an amputee ‘freaks them out.’ It was hard to hear and bugged me for a while, but I had to realize that’s just one person’s opinion and doesn’t necessarily reflect the thoughts of the majority of people.""

""Keep your chin up,"" they added. ""You’re amazing and already have inspired SO many…including me.""

Salt said she was raised in a small town and before her accident, had never met someone who used a wheelchair or had a prosthetic.

""It's very possible this man also had an upbringing where he wasn't able to see how technology and determination can give a person the tools to be successful at whatever they do,"" she said of the client she encountered.

""As an athlete, I've been very lucky to witness so many great examples of this, but I'm aware not everyone has been exposed to the same diversity,""Salt added.

Salt told Fox that the experience with the client has reminded her that even though there have been many strides toward inclusion, ""we still have work to do.""

""Me being an amputee does not limit me too much, but I also know that not every person I meet will see this,"" Salt said.

On Facebook, Salt concluded her post by reminding people that she is a ""knowledgeable, capable, hardworking and dedicated realtor.""

""I’d say I’m pretty darn able bodied and though yes, I don’t walk well and sometimes I struggle with things like stairs, I didn’t give up my career as a Realtor after my accident because I knew I could still do my job just as well as I did before,"" she wrote.

'Black alien' who mutilated his body says restaurants refuse to serve him,"One Frenchman, who calls himself the ""black alien"" after mutilating his body with various surgeries, tattoos, and other procedures, now he says restaurants are scared to serve him over his extreme appearance.

Jewish newspaper in St. Louis accuses Rep. Cori Bush of 'refusing' to grant interview,"A St. Louis-based Jewish newspaper is accusing Rep. Cori Bush, D-Mo., of ""refusing"" to grant the outlet an interview.

The editorial board of the Jewish Light said Bush's resistance to speaking with them ""should trouble our readers,"" since the Jewish community, while small, still makes up a portion of her congressional district - which includes St. Louis and various suburbs.

""The Light wishes to speak with Rep. Bush because we do our best to inform our local Jewish community about the issues they care about most,"" the editorial wrote last Wednesday. ""And Bush, during the campaign, took an unusual position for a Democratic or Republican candidate on one such topic: Israel.""

NEW YORKER UNION ACCUSED OF PROMOTING ISRAEL'S GENOCIDE FOR BACKING PALESTINIANS ‘FROM THE RIVER TO THE SEA’

As The Light noted, Bush, one of the newest members of the Democratic ""Squad,"" was a vocal supporter of the anti-Israel BDS (Boycott, Divest, Sanction) movement during the campaign. BDS urges governments and companies to put financial pressure on the Jewish State amid the ongoing conflict with Palestinians.

However, Bush reportedly removed any mention of BDS from her campaign website after her primary opponent, then-Rep. Lacy Clay, drew attention to her support for the movement.

""Wherever you are on the spectrum of opinions on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, from disinterested, to Israel can do nothing wrong, to Israel can do nothing right, to anywhere in the vast expanse in between those positions, the deletion of that page and Bush’s subsequent refusal to sit down for an interview with the Light should be a cause for concern, if you are concerned about accountability,"" The Light wrote. ""Support the BDS movement? You deserve to know if Bush continues to support its ideas. See the BDS movement as a cover for anti-Semitism? You deserve to know how Bush responds to that charge.""

The Light shed light on its communications with Bush's office and how the paper wanted to discuss ""voting restrictions; efforts to achieve racial justice; relations with the Jewish community; Israel; and anti-Semitism."" But the paper had not heard from Bush's team since April 20 when her communications director alleged she was ""working on finding the time on the Congresswoman’s calendar.""

Meanwhile, Bush continues to be vocal in support for Palestinians amid the escalating conflict between Israel and Gaza.

""If Bush and her supporters wish to affect positive change within or outside the Jewish community, silence is not the answer,"" The Light continued. ""If Bush is concerned about the welfare of her Jewish constituents — many of whom have taken active roles in the Black Lives Matter movement — and their brothers and sisters in Israel, she should say so. And what better way than by granting an interview to the Jewish Light, which seeks to inform, inspire, educate and connect local Jews on the issues they care about, including the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the treatment of Black people in America.""

DHS Secretary Chad Wolf: Iowa Dems refused help vetting caucus app,"Monday night's Iowa Democratic caucus debacle stemming from an app tied to ex-Hillary Clinton campaign staffers is ""concerning,"" Acting Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Chad Wolf said Tuesday.

Appearing on ""Fox & Friends"" with co-host Steve Doocy, Wolf said that the DHS cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency had offered to test the app from a ""hacking perspective,"" but the party had declined.

""They declined and so we are seeing a couple of issues with it,"" he told Doocy.

APP USED IN IOWA DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS FIASCO LINKED TO EX-CLINTON CAMPAIGN STAFFERS

The app, which was supposed to help the Iowa Democrats quickly report the caucus results, instead contributed to confusion and a muddled result as campaigns were in an uproar.

Shadow, a tech firm that describes itself as a group that creates ""a permanent advantage for progressive campaigns and causes through technology,"" is the company that created the app, according to The New York Times.

At least the COO, CEO, CTO and a senior product manager at Shadow all worked for the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, according to LinkedIn profiles.

In addition, some on Twitter noted that according to FEC records, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg's campaign paid Shadow over $40,000 last year for software. However, there is no indication of impropriety from the Buttigieg campaign or bias toward Buttigieg from Shadow, as independent consultants and contractors like the firm often work with several different political organizations to provide technology or other services.

On Tuesday morning, the Iowa Democratic Party Chair Troy Price released a statement confirming that there was not a ""cybersecurity intrusion"" and that their systems were tested by ""independent cybersecurity consultants.""

Disputed NPR report claimed Gorsuch refused to wear mask despite plea from Sotomayor: ‘100% false’,"Supreme Court sources and a law clerk for Justice Neil Gorsuch have both disputed a viral NPR report that claimed the conservative justice refused to wear a mask on the bench despite requests from Justice Sonia Sotomayor to do so.

NPR’s story by legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg, ""Gorsuch didn't mask despite Sotomayor's COVID worries, leading her to telework,"" reported Chief Justice John Roberts ordered the justices to wear masks because of the omicron surge since Justice Sonia Sotomayor has diabetes. Totenberg cited ""court sources"" to report Sotomayor herself expressed she ""did not feel safe in close proximity to people who were unmasked"" before Roberts made the decision.

""They all did. Except Gorsuch, who, as it happens, sits next to Sotomayor on the bench. His continued refusal since then has also meant that Sotomayor has not attended the justices' weekly conference in person, joining instead by telephone,"" Totenberg wrote. ""Gorsuch, from the beginning of his tenure, has proved a prickly justice, not exactly beloved even by his conservative soulmates on the court.""

NPR’s report, which was published on Tuesday morning, was addressed on that evening’s edition of ""Special Report with Bret Baier,"" when Fox News chief legal correspondent and ""FOX News @ Night"" anchor Shannon Bream’s sources shot down the report.

""I am told that is not accurate,"" Bream said of NPR’s version of events.

""A source at the Supreme Court says there have been no blanket admonition or request from Chief Justice Roberts that the other justices begin wearing masks to arguments,"" Bream continued. ""The source further stated Justice Sotomayor did not make any such request to Justice Gorsuch. I’m told, given that fact, there was also no refusal by Justice Gorsuch.""

Bream added that all the justices are vaccinated and boosted against COVID and undergo regular testing.

Mike Davis, a former law clerk for Gorsuch, also shot down NPR’s report.

""Fact Check: 100% False,"" Davis tweeted. ""The Chief never asked his colleagues to mask up, for any reason.""

NPR did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Katie Hobbs stumbles when pressed on refusing to debate Kari Lake: 'The debate about debates is over',"Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, D., appeared uncomfortable when facing questions about not debating her gubernatorial opponent, Republican Kari Lake, during an interview on ABC Friday.

Hobbs spoke with hosts T.J. Holmes and Amy Robach on the upcoming governor's race. Robach asked Hobbs about her refusal to debate Lake at any point during the campaign.

""Why not challenge her, though, in a public forum? I’m just curious,"" Robach asked.

After stammering, Hobbs answered, ""As far as I’m concerned, the debate about debates is over. I’m running my campaign the way I’m running my campaign. I’m going to continue to make the case directly to voters.""

Holmes, however, continued to press the issue.

""The case you make to them and, not to belabor that point, is there are tough times for a lot of folks. We talk about the economy, inflation, and I know there’s a rising cost of living here. People are putting somebody in that office that they want to stand up and fight for them. At worst, it could come off as you’re scared to step on that stage. At best, you’re not willing to confront. We’re in a new era where sometimes, some politicians have been seen as bullies, and we’ve been taught since we were little kids that you got to stand up to bullies,"" Holmes said.

He added, ""You understand how that might come across? We want to send you to fight for us, but you won’t even stand on stage with her.""

""I have stood up to this bully for the past two years, and Arizonans have seen that, and I’m going to continue to do that,"" Hobbs responded.

KARI LAKE TORCHES DEMOCRAT OPPONENT FOR REFUSING TO DEBATE: ‘BASEMENT HOBBS’ TAKING PAGE FROM BIDEN PLAYBOOK

Lake has criticized Hobbs’ refusal to face her, suggesting that it comes from Hobbs’ inability to properly debate.

""She was asked a softball question a couple of weeks ago: name one good thing about the Latino community, and she spent the entire minute and a half saying ‘um’ and 'uh' and couldn't come up with one thing. So I think she knows why she won't debate. It would be like a birthday cake versus a chainsaw if she showed up,"" Lake said on ""Fox & Friends"" Monday.

Robach also pointed out during the segment that Hobbs previously refused to debate her fellow primary opponents leading up to her nomination.

After watching a clip from a doctor describing how busy hospitals have become in the closing of 2022, Kay described her personal frustration on ""Morning Joe.""

""You would think that the country would respond by saying, ‘Okay, we’ll make sure we’re all up to date with our vaccines,’"" she said to fellow MSNBC contributor Dr. Zeke Emanuel.

We’ve had enough vaccines, and we don’t think we need them,’"" Kay said. ""I was sort of shocked and appalled.""

""But is this the kind of response you’re seeing from young people at the moment, that they think this is over, and they don’t need any more vaccines?,"" she asked Emmanuel.

Dr. Emanuel responded by saying how COVID-19 vaccines don't prevent transmission of the virus but do prevent serious illness.

""Yes, but I would say, you know, we keep thinking vaccines are going to prevent getting COVID. They don’t prevent getting COVID. What they prevent is serious illness, hospitalization and death,"" he said. ""And young people think they’re invincible — and yes, they are at lower risk from COVID, but that’s not zero risk.""

He suggested two other methods to prevent transmission altogether.

Sen. Hawley 'refused to acknowledge that some transgender men can get pregnant': Washington Post,"The Washington Post accused Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., of ""refus[ing] to acknowledge that some transgender men can get pregnant,"" in an article published late Tuesday.

Politics writer Mariana Alfaro broke down a now viral exchange between Hawley and University of California at Berkley law professor Khiara Bridges over the question of who can get pregnant, during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the impact of the end of Roe v. Wade.

‘TRANSPHOBIC’ SEN. JOSH HAWLEY ‘SCHOOLED’ BY BERKELEY LAW PROFESSOR, LEFT-WING OUTLETS INSIST

During the hearing, Hawley asked Prof. Bridges to unpack what she meant when she used the phrase, ""people with the capacity for pregnancy."" After more queries, the professor accused the senator of employing a ""transphobic"" line of questioning that would lead to ""violence"" against transgender people.

The paper gave credence to Bridges' statements that seemed unwilling to say only biological women could get pregnant. Instead, Alfaro said Hawley had ""refused to acknowledge transgender people,"" by not recognizing Bridges using ""gender-neutral"" language.

""Some experts on gender and reproductive rights use gender-neutral terms including ‘people with a capacity for pregnancy’ and ‘pregnant people’ when talking about these issues, which help illustrate that not only cisgender women have the ability for pregnancy — and cisgender women aren’t the only ones impacted by decisions to restrict reproductive health care,"" the reporter began.

She continued, ""Hawley, however, doubled down on his questioning, asking Bridges what the core of her argument was. Bridges then told the senator his line of questioning was transphobic, because he was refusing to acknowledge transgender people.""

The way the paper framed the exchange provoked a flurry of mockery online.

Taliban spokesman refuses to explicitly denounce Al Qaeda in Lara Logan interview,"In an exclusive interview with Fox Nation's Lara Logan, of ""Lara Logan Has No Agenda"", the Taliban's chief spokesman refused multiple attempts by the investigative journalist to give an explicit condemnation of terror group Al Qaeda.

The interview, held only a few weeks before Afghanistan fell to Taliban insurgents over the weekend, will air in its entirety during a larger ""No Agenda"" special on Afghanistan being simulcast Sunday at 10 PM ET on Fox News Channel and the Fox Nation streaming service.

Logan told ""America Reports"" on Monday the idea that the Taliban is not ideologically linked to or working with Al Qaeda is ""the most ridiculous lie of this entire war.""

In her original interview, Logan pressed Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen on the militant group's long-presumed ties to the terror group that orchestrated the 9/11 attacks.

""Why have you not renounced Al Qaeda,"" she asked Shaheen.

""If you have read the Doha Agreement, we have clearly said we will not allow anyone -- whether an individual or entity -- any group to use the site of Afghanistan against the United States or its allies,"" Shaheen replied, referring to a 2020 treaty between the United States and the Taliban signed in the Qatari capital.

Logan responded by clarifying that Shaheen did not directly answer the question, but instead pronounced that the Taliban would not let Afghanistan be used for foreign terror attacks in general.

BIDEN STANDS BY US-AFGHANISTAN WITHDRAWAL

""[T]he specific question is why will you not renounce Al Qaeda? You never have. Not from day one, not from 9/11 on 'til now,"" she pressed.

Shaheen replied that the Taliban purportedly condemns the murder of civilians by ""any entity – any group – whether it is an organization, a state, any group – to kill civilians. That is our agenda: A denouncing of anyone.""

Logan noted to the audience that Shaheen is well-versed in Taliban ideology and messaging things a certain way to the public that seeks to paint the organization in a certain light. She said Shaheen was previously the editor of the state-run Kabul Times; described as Taliban propaganda published and disseminated for English-speaking audiences.

To Shaheen, Logan pressed again for a straight answer on whether he or his militants would denounce Al Qaeda and declare them an unrelated entity.

""A general statement about people who attack civilians is not the same thing,"" she said.

Shaheen bristled, responding that ""I think anyone who is killing – it is our clear policy… For us it is clear, maybe not clear for you, but for us it is clear.""

He claimed that the Taliban has ""no foreign agenda"" despite purporting to have the resources and wherewithal to carry out attacks outside Afghanistan over the past 20 years, against what he called ""invading countries.""

""We didn't do that. We fought them in our country in order to gain independence of our country. That is our legitimate right.""

Logan tried once again, even further declaratively, to get Shaheen and the Taliban explicitly on the record:

""You do not support Al Qaeda's goal to see the Uma restored to the Earth and an Islamic caliphate on Earth?""

""I already told you our policy,"" Shaheen responded, with Logan replying that he isn't appearing to be forthright — given that deceased Al Qaeda and Taliban militants are often found together, that they reportedly have been in the same Pakistani hospitals, and that there is evidence of joint bases in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.

""That feels like fake news and propaganda,"" Logan concluded in part.

""I think the fake allegations — who prolonged the war in Afghanistan for 20 years, who caused the 2 trillion in losses to America… the reason was this meaningless war; it was because [of] such fake allegations -- I hope to put a big stop to these allegations,"" Shaheen replied.""

On ""America Reports"" Monday, Logan added the Taliban never truly left the scene in Afghanistan and reconstituted:

""They have never gone anywhere. They were never decimated. They were never defeated. All of that was fundamentally dishonest, and it began a long time ago,"" she said.

""In 2006, I literally collected from the battlefield every single report and counted up how many Al Qaeda were captured and killed and wounded in clashes with American and Afghan forces. For over two years, I had done that, and it showed, demonstrated, that there were more Al Qaeda killed and captured that the United States government were saying even existed by 2009.""",https://www.foxnews.com/media/taliban-spokesman-refuses-to-explicitly-denounce-al-qaeda-in-lara-logan-interview,N/A
Texas nurse fired for refusing 'implicit bias' training: 'Very degrading to the profession',"A Texas nurse is pushing back against ""implicit bias"" training in the health care industry, which resulted in her being terminated from her job.

Nurse Laura Morgan joined ""America's Newsroom"" Monday to discuss her refusal to take the mandated training course and her firing as a result.

""Implicit bias training does operate on the concept that all health care workers are implicitly biased against their patients and must make decisions at the point of care based on things that don't have anything to do with the medical care of the patient,"" Morgan said.

""This type of training and other radical ideologies that are infiltrating health care, are really causing divisiveness between the relationship of trust between doctors and nurses and their patients.""

DOCTOR BURNOUT REACHED 'HIGHEST LEVEL ON RECORD' DURING COVID, EXPERTS WANT ACTION

Morgan argued the course tells health care workers to ""look at their patients through an ideological lens instead of a clinical one"" and emphasized that this takes away the focus from health care providers to meet their patients' medical needs.

Morgan also called the course ""degrading"" to the profession.

""Nurses, doctors, and other health care professionals in these states where the training is mandated, are not able to obtain their licenses without taking this training, which tells them that they are unconsciously biased against their patients and make poor decisions based on those biases that result in poor patient outcomes,"" she said.

Morgan's employer, Dallas-based Baylor Scott & White Health, rolled out the ""Overcoming Unconscious Bias"" course within its annual training courses in September 2021, she wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed last week .

After reviewing the interactive course, Morgan wrote that she contacted her supervisor and human resources with her concerns but was not given an exemption. She was terminated in February.

""The idea of implicit bias is grounded in the belief that white people treat those who aren’t white worse than those who are. It’s part of the woke assumption that society, including health care, suffers from ‘systemic racism.’ Accordingly, my own supposed implicit bias, which is a euphemism for ingrained racism, must be rooted out. Not only that, it must be replaced with preferential treatment for the nonwhite. I fail to see how real racial discrimination is justified by my nonexistent racism,"" she wrote.",https://www.foxnews.com/media/texas-nurse-fired-refusing-implicit-bias-training-very-degrading-profession,N/A
GOP leadership punts on defunding Planned Parenthood,"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says he will not fight to defund Planned Parenthood, for the moment. He says conservatives need to be patient. He says the time isn’t right. He says that we need to wait. Again.



There's no pretty way of putting this. What he’s really saying is that he’s just not going to stop the taxpayer-funded slaughter of the unborn.

No event in recent memory has shocked the country like the undercover Planned Parenthood videos. Americans from across the political spectrum have seen the horrific and sadistic acts this organization commits routinely, without any remorse or the slightest hint of conscience or humanity. In fact, sometimes Planned Parenthood finds it funny.

Planned Parenthood isn’t providing a “service.” They’re killing babies.

Oftentimes political issues aren’t completely black or white. This one is. There is no middle ground. It’s time for Republicans to choose sides. It is no time for silence.

What, exactly, have these videos taught us?

We now know that Planned Parenthood profits from butchering children still in the womb. We now know they haggle over the price of babies’ body parts.

We now know they collect and sell infants’ remains without the mothers knowing. We now know that they modify their abortion practices specifically to get the best “specimens.” We now know these abortionists even recognize the humanity of the children they massacre—“Another boy!” exclaimed one Planned Parenthood worker upon extracting so-called “tissue” of a male infant from his mother.

More Americans than ever now know without a shadow of a doubt that Planned Parenthood’s business is the brutal and methodical destruction of unborn children. We also know that McConnell doesn’t plan to do a thing about it.

John Boehner didn't show the willingness to take the appropriate action, either. Neither man seems moved enough by these videos to put an end to taxpayer funding of procedures and practices that would be considered manslaughter—at a bare minimum—in any other context.

All they offer is meaningless ""show"" votes to take back to their constituents as some sort of evidence of their sincerity. The only legislation that matters is ""must pass"" legislation that if vetoed by President Obama, will cause a government showdown.

It's such a winner for them too! All Republicans need do is tell America they are willing to fund the entirety of the federal government, including so many things they don't like -- but not this horror. It's not just inappropriate, it's immoral.

They will not allocate one penny of taxpayer funds to enable this butchery -- period. Let Obama tell the American people that unless their taxes go to pay for this slaughter, he'll close down the government.

America will then understand the true nature of this radical regime that has so completely endorsed the culture of death. But McConnell and Boehner have both refused to do this.

Republican leaders who allow the funding of Planned Parenthood have a real problem with the truth. Saying they’re “pro-life” is like Jeb Bush saying he’s an “outsider” or Hillary Clinton insisting she’s transparent—embarrassing political posturing completely refuted by actual behavior and actions.

No more chicanery. The stakes are too high. The time for excuses is over. Conservatives’ patience has worn thin.

Conservatives support the Republican Party to the extent that it defends conservative principles. We are not in the business of defending the party at the expense of those principles. Chief among them—the right to life.

If the Planned Parenthood videos don’t give Republicans the perfect opportunity to fight for the pro-life cause, then when should we expect them to ever fight? These nightmarish images have reverberated far beyond the pro-life movement, yet McConnell and the leadership in the House still appear to care more about their (erroneous) political calculations than the defense of unborn children.

It’s disgusting. Boehner signaled he would refuse to fight for the unborn and enough of his members had enough. He resigned one step ahead of a recall. He no longer deserved to be Speaker.

It's harder to claim McConnell should be recalled as Senate Majority Leader. Based on what has transpired since Election Day, it appears Harry Reid never vacated that position. If this issue can't motivate McConnell to behave like a leader, what will?

Has McConnell not watched the video showing Planned Parenthood staff laughing at an aborted baby’s beating heart? Has he not watched the video with the abortionist nonchalantly describing slicing through a baby's face to reach and extract the brain?

It's harsh, but I'll ask it: Does Sen. McConnell have a conscience?

There’s no other way to say it. If Congress votes to send taxpayer money -- your money, my money -- to fund this slaughter, then Congress is complicit in this slaughter.

Oftentimes political issues aren’t completely black or white. This one is. There is no middle ground.

It’s time for Republicans to choose sides. It is no time for silence.

We must stop handing over taxpayer dollars to help fund these atrocities. We must also stop supporting Republicans who continue funding of these atrocities.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/gop-leadership-punts-on-defunding-planned-parenthood,N/A
Purple Hearts for Ft. Hood victims: Congress aims to right Obama administration wrong,"Editor's note: The following column originally appeared in The Washington Times.

Finally righting one of many shameful actions President Obama has imposed on our nation, Congress is passing legislation which makes eligible those killed and injured in the Fort Hood terrorist attack of 2009 to receive the Purple Heart.

In an early indication of the how craven Mr. Obama's politics are, he knew the attack sent a message that with his election the enemy felt they had free reign. So, Mr. Obama decided to pretend the soldiers under attack by the enemy were in fact just victims of ""workplace violence.""

The refusal by the administration to recognize the true nature of the attack meant our soldiers who were injured could not receive the Purple Heart with which comes a variety of benefits. Additionally, for those killed, their families would also be denied the additional benefits afforded loved ones whose family member gave all serving our country.

[pullquote]

But now, that is about to change. In May of this year, language was included in the FY15 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) congressional conference agreement giving victims of that terrorist attack Purple Heart status. Before the end of the lame duck session, the only thing standing between righting this wrong for our military is the signature of Mr. Obama.

According to NBC in Dallas, Rep. Roger Williams and Rep. John Carter, Texas Republicans, released a statement Thursday saying, ""This is a huge step in the joint efforts to help victims of the Fort Hood terrorist attack, and I'd like to thank Rep. John Carter and many of our Texas colleagues for their endless support. Our nation's leaders must uphold our solemn commitment to provide for troops in harm's way — whether at home or abroad. President Obama has neglected those whose lives were taken and forever changed that day. This bipartisan, bicameral legislation gives President Obama yet another opportunity to honor his pledge to take care of our American soldiers who were victims of terrorism.""

Yet, we didn't need an act of Congress to make this happen. The Pentagon awarded Purple Hearts and civilian medals to all members of the armed services who were killed or wounded during the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. On Sept. 28, 2001 the Savannah Morning News reported, ""All members of the U.S. armed services killed or wounded in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks will be awarded the Purple Heart, and the Defense Department has created the Defense of Freedom Medal to be awarded to all department civilians killed or wounded.

""In making the announcement Thursday, [then-] Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said the tributes were appropriate, given the unprecedented nature of the attacks on the Pentagon and the World Trade Center. ... ""They were acts of war — military strikes against the United States of America,"" Mr. Rumsfeld said.

What a difference a Democratic administration makes. When faced with the Fort Hood terrorist attack, the Obama Pentagon sent out a smug and sneering ""position paper"" detailing why they refused to award the Purple Heart to the victims. ABC News reported in April 2013, ""A Pentagon position paper, delivered to congressional staff on Friday and obtained by ABC News, says giving the award to the Fort Hood victims could ""irrevocably alter the fundamental character of this time-honored decoration"" and ""undermine the prosecution of Major Nidal Hasan [the alleged Fort Hood shooter] by materially and directly compromising Major Hasan's ability to receive a fair trial. ...

""Despite extensive evidence that Hasan was in communication with Al Qaeda leader Anwar al-Awlaki prior to the attack, the military has denied the victims a Purple Heart and has treated the incident as ""workplace violence"" instead of ""combat related"" or terrorism. Last month, a spokesman for recently appointed Defense Secretary, Chuck Hagel, told ABC News the Department's position had not changed under his leadership.""

As the Washington Times reported last week, ""The new medal criteria will apply to all military members injured or killed at Fort Hood as well as to two soldiers attacked in a 2009 shooting outside an Arkansas recruiting office. ... Sen. John Cornyn, Texas Republican, called the change ""long overdue."" An aide said Mr. Cornyn will push the Pentagon to award the Purple Hearts as soon as possible after the defense bill is signed into law.""

As in 2001, recognizing the sacrifice of our military is something an administration can do without intervention by Congress. For the Obama administration, so fond of executive orders, and reigning with his pen and phone, his refusal to allow the Purple Heart for the Fort Hood massacre victims remains one of his more disturbed actions.

The right thing to do was obvious to President George W. Bush and Secretary Rumsfeld. Now, with Secretary Hagel on his way out, will Defense Secretary nominee Ash Carter do the right thing, or be as determined as his boss to continue the insult?

With this legislation, even though five years late, we are also reminded about what Congress can do, if they really want to. It was clear in the spring of this election year that we 'stupid' natives had grown restless. Amazing how much politicians can get done when we the people begin to order up the tar and feathers.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/purple-hearts-for-ft-hood-victims-congress-aims-to-right-obama-administration-wrong,N/A
Schiff says Bolton refused to submit affidavit during impeachment trial,"Lead House impeachment manager Adam Schiff, D-Calif., on Wednesday said former national security adviser John Bolton refused to submit a sworn affidavit during President Trump's Senate trial about his alleged misconduct in withholding military aid to Ukraine.

Schiff told MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow that after the Senate voted to not call witnesses, Democrats approached Bolton’s counsel to see if he would be willing to give a written statement ""describing what he observed in terms of the president’s Ukraine misconduct.""

Maddow noted that Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y. told reporters earlier the House would likely subpoena him after Trump's acquittal.

Schiff added, “For whatever reason, he was willing to testify before the Senate but apart from that seems intent on saving it for his book. He’ll have to answer for that.”

NADLER THREATENS BOLTON SUBPOENA AFTER IMPEACHMENT ENDS

Bolton shook the impeachment trial on Jan. 26 when the New York Times reported a leaked excerpt from his forthcoming book that said Trump explicitly linked the hold on $391 million in Ukrainian military aid to an investigation of Joe and Hunter Biden.

In early January, Bolton said in a statement he would be willing to testify before the Senate trial if subpoenaed to meet his “obligations both as a citizen and as former National Security Advisor.”

Democrats withdrew their subpoena during their impeachment hearings last fall when Bolton challenged it in court.

Schiff told Maddow “there’s been absolutely no decision made” about whether the House will subpoena Bolton.

Bolton has not commented on Schiff's claim.

Arizona secretary of state calls to investigate Cochise County supervisors who refused to certify election,"The Arizona secretary of state's office is calling for an investigation into, and enforcement action against, potential violations of state law committed by two Cochise County supervisors who refused to certify results for the midterm election.

In a Friday memo directed to Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich and Cochise County Attorney Brian McIntyre, State Elections Director Kori Lorick noted that it took a court order for the board to canvass the election – with one who she said ""continued to defy his statutory responsibility"" as well as the Thursday ruling of Judge Casey McGinley.

She said that the supervisors knew that they had a statutory requirement to canvass the election by a Nov. 28 deadline but ""chose to act in violation of the law, putting false election narratives ahead of the Cochise County's voters.""

Lorick cited a Nov. 28 report from The New York Times, in which one of the supervisors reportedly said that concerns about machines used to tabulate ballots were mostly a pretext and ""the only thing [they had] to stand on.""

She said these actions jeopardize Arizona's democracy.

""Had a court not intervened, the failure of these two supervisors to uphold their duty would have disenfranchised thousands of Cochise County voters. This blatant act of defying Arizona’s election laws risks establishing a dangerous precedent that we must discourage,"" Lorick concluded.

Supervisor Tom Crosby told Fox News Digital that he had been advised not to attend the meeting.

""Prior to the meeting to certify the canvass, I was advised by the Attorney for the Board, not to attend,"" he wrote in an email Saturday.

""Today’s court decision was a win for Arizona’s democracy and ensures that all Arizonans will have their votes counted. Cochise County has been ordered to canvass today, and the state certification of the 2022 General Election will proceed as scheduled on Monday,"" Hobbs tweeted on Thursday.

The three men, or some combination of them, have filed at least four cases raising similar claims before the Arizona Supreme Court since 2021 seeking to have the state's 2020 election results thrown out. The court has dismissed all of them for lack of evidence, waiting too long after the election was certified or asking for relief that could not be granted, in increasingly harsh language.

But Tom Rice, Brian Steiner and Daniel Wood managed to persuade the two Republicans who control the Cochise County board of supervisors that their claims were valid enough for them to delay the certification until a Nov. 28 deadline.

AZ BOARD MEMBERS WITHDRAW LAWSUIT DEMANDING BALLOTS SHOULD BE HAND COUNTED

They claimed the U.S. Elections Assistance Commission allowed certifications for testing companies to lapse, and that voided the certifications of vote tabulation equipment used across the state.

That came despite testimony from the state's elections director that the machines and the testing company were indeed certified.

""The equipment used in Cochise County is properly certified under both federal and state laws and requirements,"" state Elections Director Kori Lorick told the board. ""The claims that the SLI testing labs were not properly accredited are false.""

The move is the latest drama in the Republican-heavy county in recent weeks, which started when GOP board members Tom Crosby and Peggy Judd voted to have all the ballots in last week's election counted by hand to determine if the machine counts were accurate.

Crosby also defended a lawsuit he and Judd filed against the county elections director earlier this week seeking to force the hand-count. They dropped the case against Lisa Marra on Wednesday.

""If our presenters' request is met by the proof that our machines are indeed legally and lawfully accredited, then indeed we should accept the results,"" Crosby said. ""However, if the machines have not been lawfully certificated, then the converse is also true. We cannot verify this election now.""

Crosby and Judd then voted to delay certification, with Crosby saying he believed Wood, Steiner and Rice needed to be provided proof since they were ""the experts.""

Democratic Supervisor Ann English was powerless to overrule them.

The delay potentially jeopardizes state certification, set for Dec. 5, and at least one statewide recount.

Lorick issued a statement after the vote vowing legal action to force the board to accept the results. Under Arizona law the formal election canvass can’t be changed by the elected county boards — their only role is to accept the numbers as they are tallied by their elections departments.

""If they fail to do so, the Secretary (of State) will use all available legal remedies to compel compliance with Arizona law and protect Cochise County voters' rights to have their votes counted,"" Lorick said.

ARIZONA CERTIFICATION THREATENED BY A HAND-COUNTING BALLOT LAWSUIT

All 15 Arizona counties face the same Nov. 28 deadline, but there is no sign others are considering similar defiance.

Once the state certifies the results Dec. 5, there will be a recount in at least one statewide race.

That contest, between Republican Abraham Hamadeh and Democrat Kris Mayes for attorney general, is so close that a recount is certain. As of Friday night, Mayes was less than 600 votes ahead with fewer ballots remaining to be counted than the margin for a mandatory recount, which will be about 12,500 votes.

""It's going to be close, and every vote matters,"" Mayes said in a brief interview. ""And obviously we're headed into a recount, one way or another.""

One other statewide race also is within the margin for a recount, but incumbent Superintendent of Public Instruction Kathy Hoffman conceded to Republican Tom Horne on Thursday. Horne is a former schools chief who served two years as attorney general before losing the 2014 primary. He was more than 9,000 votes ahead on Friday.

Horne criticized Hoffman for embracing progressive teaching and promised to shut down any hint of ""critical race theory,"" which is not taught in state schools but is a hot-button issue for social conservatives.

Judd had said Wednesday she would move to clear the way for the state recount.

""We’ve had to step back from everything we were trying to do and say, OK, we’ve got to let this play out,"" Judd told The Associated Press. ""Because it’s the last thing we want to do to get in (Marra’s) way.""

There has been no evidence of widespread fraud or manipulation of voting machines in 2020 or during this year’s midterm elections.

Barrett begins visits with senators as several Dems refuse to meet with her,"Supreme Court nominee Judge Amy Coney Barrett is set to start meeting with senators on Tuesday as her accelerated confirmation process continues despite multiple Democrats refusing to see her, calling the process that led to her nomination so close to a presidential election ""illegitimate.""

""I believe first the whole process has been illegitimate,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said on Sunday. ""And second, because she's already stated that she is for overturning the ACA. I will not meet with her.""

Schumer, who has said if Barrett is confirmed the GOP ""will have stolen two Supreme Court seats,"" is joined by Sens. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and Maize Hirono, D-Hawaii, in refusing to meet with the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals judge. ""I will oppose the confirmation of Judge Amy Coney Barrett, as I would any nominee proposed as part of this illegitimate sham process, barely one month before an election as Americans are already casting their votes,"" Blumenthal said Sunday.

LIVE UPDATES: SUPREME COURT FIGHT BEFORE FIRST DEBATE

Barrett's most high-profile meetings will be with Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., Senate Majority Whip John Thune, R-S.D, and a joint sit-down with both Vice President Mike Pence and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.

Graham, McConnell and Thune have already declared their support for Barrett, as have a number of other Senate Republicans who are familiar with the judge from her 2017 circuit court confirmation.

""She's somebody who respects the Constitution, the law, precedent and is very vigilant in making sure they applied in an evenhanded way,"" Thune said Monday. ""It's going to be very very hard to argue that she isn't qualified for this. In terms of her temperament, her judicial philosophy, she's exactly the kind of justice you would want to see on the Supreme Court.

Barrett will also meet with Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas; Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa; Rick Scott, R-Fla.; Mike Crapo, R-Idaho; Mike Lee, R-Utah; and Cory Gardner, R-Colo.

Barrett's meetings will begin at 10:30 a.m. with McConnell and Pence in McConnell's office then continue throughout the day in the Mansfield Room before concluding with Graham at 5:30 p.m.

The meeting with Gardner could be the most important one for Barrett. Gardner is in a tough reelection fight and was initially one of the Republican senators closely watched for whether he would support moving forward with a Supreme Court confirmation less than two months before the presidential election. He eventually said he would back the process. But his statements on the vacancy have not been commitments to a ""yea"" vote.

""Should a qualified nominee ... be put forward, I will vote to confirm,"" Gardner said earlier last week.

REPUBLICANS EYE AMY CONEY BARRETT SENATE FLOOR VOTE AT END OF OCTOBER, JUST DAYS BEFORE ELECTION

He added after Barrett's official nomination: ""In the days and weeks ahead, I look forward to meeting with Judge Amy Coney Barrett and thoroughly examining her judicial record as I fulfill my constitutional duty of advice and consent.""

Should there be no unexpected defections, Republicans appear to have the numbers to push through the confirmation, which is much closer to the presidential election than any other in modern history. Only Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, have said they oppose moving ahead with the confirmation ahead of the election. And Murkowski has softened her stance in recent days, saying she will meet with the nominee as she acknowledged ""this process is moving forward with or without me.”

The Senate last confirmed a justice during an election year with Justice Frank Murphy in January 1940. Before that, it confirmed Justice Benjamin Cardozo in February 1932 and Justice Louis Brandeis in January 1916.

Republicans can afford to lose three total votes and have Vice President Mike Pence break a tie. It's unclear that any other GOP senators, having expressed no qualms about the timing of the nomination, would vote to reject a GOP nominee. But there are still several hurdles in the confirmation process for Barrett to clear, including her Senate meetings, intense media and committee vetting, and committee hearings slated to start Oct. 12, a committee vote, then finally a floor vote on her confirmation -- and that's if things go as planned for Republicans.

Democrats plan to pressure electorally vulnerable and moderate senators like Gardner, as well as Sens. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, Thom Tillis, R-N.C., Martha McSally, R-Ariz., Joni Ernst, R-Iowa and others.

""By nominating Judge Barrett to the Supreme Court, President Trump has put Americans' health care at grave risk,"" Schumer said at a Saturday press conference in New York City. ""And as COVID-19 continues and we need more health care, the nomination by President Trump of Amy Coney Barrett will mean less health care for over 100 million Americans.""

He added: ""Health care is the most important issue on the ballot to Americans and as Americans learn Judge Barrett's views on health care and so many other issues, she will become less and less popular, and hopefully they will call their senators and say 'don't vote for someone who will take away my health care.'""

Becerra in 1997 refused to call for free elections in Cuba,"California Attorney General Xavier Becerra as a congressman in 1997 refused to call for free elections following a meeting with Cuban dictator Fidel Castro, and he voted ten years later to end a trade embargo with the communist dictatorship.

Becerra, President Biden's choice to head the Health and Human Services Department, clashed with Cuban-Americans in the House Hispanic caucus after, as chairman of the group, he traveled to the island to meet with Castro.

Moderates in Congress like Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, Joe Manchin, D-W. Va., and Mitt Romney, R-Utah, have not yet decided how they’ll vote in Becerra’s confirmation. Becerra faced questions from conservatives who voiced concerns that he was too liberal or inexperienced as a healthcare leader.

Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Lincoln Diaz-Balart, Republicans from South Florida, said in 1997 that they were ""personally insulted"" by the then-congressman’s four-day trip to the island nation. They resigned from the caucus, which then had no Republican members left.

Diaz-Balart said that he would not contribute membership dues to the caucus until Becerra ""demonstrates minimal respect for the rights of Cubans to be free and calls for free elections for that oppressed island,"" according to the Los Angeles Times.

Becerra later said he could not issue a call for free and fair elections.

""This is an issue that the caucus doesn't take positions on,"" he said, so he could not make a statement, according to The Hill.

GOP SENATORS QUESTION BECERRA QUALIFICATIONS TO LEAD HHS

Aides to Becerra brushed off criticisms at the time, saying he had attempted to hear from all sides and had spoken to both Cuban dissidents and Castro himself.

Becerra later defended the trip, telling NPR: ""As an American citizen who has had the privilege now of being elected to Congress ... I should be as educated as I can be on a number of issues.

""I'm very disappointed that the two members decided to take this action. I consider them friends,"" he said. ""And I know that they are very passionate about the issue. Certainly, it -- the whole issue of Cuba is one that the caucus, because there has not been a strong consensus, has decided not to take on. I -- as the new chair of the caucus, it was not my intention to change that policy either. They chose, however, to make it an issue,"" he said.

Becerra has repeatedly voted for softening the trade embargo with Cuba. In 2007, he backed an amendment by Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., to make it easier to ship farm goods to Cuba and another amendment from Rangel that prohibited funding to implement the trade embargo with Cuba.

As health and human services secretary, Becerra would not have much a say in U.S. Cuba policy. But the communist-run island still likely was relieved when the Biden administration took the reins. With the Obama administration came an historic warming of U.S.-Cuba relations and a flood of American visitors to the nation. But the Trump administration had reversed the Obama detente, squeezing Cuba with sanctions and isolation.

"Catholic hospital discriminated against trans patient by refusing hysterectomy, US district judge rules","A federal judge ruled Friday that a Catholic hospital in Maryland discriminated against a patient by refusing to perform gender transition surgery.

St. Joseph Medical Center in Towson, Maryland, refused to proceed with a hysterectomy scheduled for patient Jesse Hammons.

Hammons, 33, is a biological woman who believes herself to be a man. Hammons was seeking the hysterectomy as part of a gender transition, but St. Joseph Medical Center refused to perform the operation due to guidelines set by the National Catholic Bioethics Center.

U.S. District Court Judge Deborah Chasanow ruled on Jan. 6 that the hospital's refusal to remove a healthy organ for the purposes of gender transitioning was ""discriminatory.""

""This court has determined that undisputed facts establish that, as a matter of law, Defendants discriminated against Plaintiff on the basis of his sex; UMMS is a proper defendant—all three Defendants are health programs or activities that receive federal funds,"" Chasanow wrote in the court opinion. ""St. Joseph is not covered by the Religious Sisters of Mercy injunction; there are no material facts in dispute; and St. Joseph may not assert a defense based on [the Religious Freedom Restoration Act].""

The hospital's parent network offered to move the procedure to a different facility without Catholic ethical considerations, but Hammons declined.

""This is a great win for myself and all transgender people denied equal treatment because of who they are,"" Hammons said in a statement via the American Civil Liberties Union. ""All I wanted was for UMMS to treat my health care like anyone else’s, and I’m glad the court recognized how unfair it was to turn me away. I’m hopeful UMMS can change this harmful policy and help more transgender people access the care they need.""

St. Joseph Medical Center is part of the University of Maryland Medical System (UMMS), a nonprofit healthcare network ostensibly privatized by the state legislature in 1984.

However, Chasanow previously ruled that UMMS's continued cooperation with the Maryland government classifies it as a public entity, making its individual hospitals unable to claim religious exemption from procedures contrary to Catholic ethics.

Chasanow ruled that UMMS and St. Joseph Medical Center's refusal to perform the hysterectomy violated the Affordable Care Act's protections against discrimination based on sex.

Christian bakers who refused service for same-sex couple vow to appeal court's split-decision,"Two Christian bakers in Oregon who faced a $135,000 fine for refusing to bake a cake to celebrate a same-sex wedding in 2011 received a partial victory in court Wednesday.

While the Oregon Court of Appeals upheld the ruling that Aaron and Melissa Klein, erstwhile owners of Sweet Cakes by Melissa, had violated the law by refusing to create an artistic cake to celebrate the nuptials of Rachel Cryer and Laurel Bowman, it also ruled that the state's Bureau of Labor and Industries (BOLI) had violated the First Amendment's ""requirement of strict neutrality toward religion"" in determining the damages the Kleins must pay. The court returned the case to BOLI to determine the correct damages.

MASTERPIECE CAKESHOP OWNER JACK PHILIPPS: HOW I BECAME THE FACE OF ‘RIGHTS OF CONSCIENCE’ LITIGATION IN US

First Liberty, the law firm representing the Kleins, cried foul and told Fox News Digital that the bakers plan to appeal the decision to the state's supreme court.

""Oregon is trying to have its cake and eat it, too,"" Stephanie Taub, senior counsel for First Liberty, said in a statement. ""The Court admits the state agency that acted as both prosecutor and judge in this case was biased against the Kleins’ faith. Yet, despite this anti-Christian bias that infected the whole case, the court is sending the case back to the very same agency for a do-over.""

""Today’s opinion should have been the end of this ten year long saga,"" Taub added. ""It’s time for the state of Oregon’s hostility toward Aaron and Melissa to end.""

The Kleins first served Cryer and Bowman by baking a cake to celebrate the marriage of Cryer's mother to a man, yet they declined a later order for the same-sex ceremony. Cryer and Bowman then went to BOLI, claiming that they had been "" mentally raped "" by the rejection, even though the couple found another bakery willing to create the cake at a much lower price. BOLI ruled that the Kleins had discriminated against Cryer and Bowman due to their sexual orientation, and fined them $135,000 in non-economic damages for ""emotional distress.""

While the Kleins raised some money on GoFundMe, activists convinced the crowdfunding site to remove the page and the bakery closed in 2016.

The Kleins appealed up the courts to the Supreme Court, which ordered the lower courts to reconsider the case in light of the June 2018 Supreme Court decision Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission. In that case, the Court ruled that the commission had employed ""impermissible hostility"" against a Christian baker's faith, violating the First Amendment.

The Oregon Court of Appeals found that, ""when viewed in the light of Masterpiece Cakeshop, BOLI's handling of the damages portion of the case does not reflect the neutrality toward religion required by the Free Exercise Clause.""

""The prosecutor's closing argument apparently equating the Kleins' religious beliefs with ‘prejudice,’ together with the agency's reasoning for imposing damages in connection with Aaron's quotation of Leviticus, reflect that the agency acted in a way that passed judgment on the Kleins' religious beliefs, something that is impermissible under Masterpiece Cakeshop,"" the court ruled. ""BOLI effectively took a side in an ongoing religious discussion"" – the side supporting an alteration in the centuries-old Christian definition of marriage as between one man and one woman.

A spokesperson for First Liberty told Fox News Digital that the Kleins intend to appeal the decision to the Oregon Supreme Court and, if necessary, the U.S. Supreme Court.

"Cuomo refuses to resign, lashes out at 'reckless' politicians as Dems call for him to quit","New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Friday refused to resign amid mounting pressure from fellow Democrats for him to step down over sexual misconduct accusations leveled against him -- with Cuomo lashing out at ""reckless and dangerous"" politicians he accused of not knowing all the facts.

""Women have a right to come forward and be heard and I encourage that fully. But I also want to be clear, there is still a question of the truth, I did not do what has been alleged. Period,"" he said in a press conference.

AOC, TOP NY CONGRESSIONAL DEMS CALL FOR CUOMO'S RESIGNATION AMID ALLEGATIONS

""I won't speculate about people's possible motives but I can tell you as a former attorney general who has gone through this situation many times, there are often many motivations for making an allegation and that is why you need to know the facts before you make decision,"" he said.

He then addressed the slew of House Democrats from the New York delegation and at the state level who have called for him to resign.

""Politicians who don't know a single fact but then form a conclusion and an opinion are in my opinion reckless and dangerous,"" he said. ""The people of New York should not have confidence in a politician who takes a position without knowing any facts or substance — that, my friends, is politics at its worst.""

He later said: ""A lot of people allege a lot of things for a lot of reasons.""

Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Jamaal Bowman, Jerry Nadler, Nydia Velazquez, Grace Meng, Sean Patrick Maloney and Carolyn Maloney on Friday added their voices to those calling for Cuomo to step down.

""This week, the second sexual assault allegation and the sixth harassment allegation was leveled against Governor Cuomo,"" Ocasio-Cortez and Bowman said in a statement. ""The fact that this latest report was so recent is alarming, and it raises concerns about the present safety and well-being of the administration’s staff. These allegations have all been consistent and highly-detailed, and there are also credible media reports substantiating their accounts.""

CUOMO ALLEGATIONS: NEW YORK STATE FILES POLICE REPORT IN ALBANY OVER GROPING CLAIM AT EXECUTIVE MANSION

Nadler, meanwhile, called the accusations ""credible"" and ""serious."" He said that while Cuomo is guaranteed due process, ""the question before us is squarely a political judgment.""

""Governor Cuomo has lost the confidence of the people of New York. Governor Cuomo must resign,"" he said.

The lawmakers spoke after the Albany Times Union reported that a woman said Cuomo aggressively groped her at the executive mansion after summoning her there to help him with a cellphone issue. Cuomo is alleged to have reached under her blouse, according to the paper.

The sixth woman to come forward with allegations against Cuomo is the latest in a cavalcade of accusations facing the governor, as well as a nursing home scandal that some lawmakers have cited when calling for Cuomo's resignation.

That scandal erupted in January when Attorney General Letitia James' office announced that the administration had undercounted deaths in nursing homes by up to 50% — raising questions about a possible cover-up.

NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio on Friday urged Cuomo to ""do something that's decent after these many, many indecent revelations and simply resign.""

Those calls came after array of state Democrats had called for him to resign and a possible impeachment investigation has been initiated. Dozens of Democratic members of the state Assembly and Senate issued a joint statement on Thursday calling for Cuomo to resign due to the two scandals.

The lawmakers, 59 in total, said that they must ""decide what is best for the future of New York state,"" as the twin controversies have hurt Cuomo's standing and have left him ""ineffective"" as the state deals with health and economic crises.

Allegations of misconduct started in late February, when former aide Lindsey Boylan accused Cuomo of sexual harassment. Since then, allegations have mounted up.

Last month, Cuomo apologized for interactions that he said ""may have been insensitive or too personal and that some of my comments, given my position, made others feel in ways I never intended."" However, he denied inappropriately touching anyone. State Attorney General James has launched an investigation into the allegations.

CUOMO GOVERNORSHIP HANGING BY THREAD AS ALLEGATIONS MOUNT

On Friday, Cuomo made it clear he would not resign: ""I am not going to resign, I was not elected by the politicians, I was elected by the people.""

He urged people to wait for the independent reviews to be conducted.

""There are now two reviews underway, no one wants them to have been more quickly and more thoroughly than I do — let them do it,"" he said.

He also said elected officials often take positions for all sorts of reasons, including ""political expediency"" and bowing to pressure.

""People know the difference between bowing to cancel culture and the truth — let the review proceed,"" he said.

Defeated Democrat Stacey Abrams won't call Brian Kemp legitimate Georgia gov-elect,"Defeated Democratic Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacy Abrams, who admitted last week that she could not beat Republican Brian Kemp, on Sunday refused to call Kemp the legitimate governor-elect and said democracy had ""failed"" in the state.

In an interview with CNN, Abrams said only that Kemp, Georgia's former secretary of state, had ""won an adequate number of votes to become the governor of Georgia"" and would become the ""legal governor of Georgia"" when he takes the oath of office.

""But we know sometimes the law does not do what it should, and something being legal does not make it right,"" Abrams told Tapper. ""What you are looking for me to say is that there was no compromise of our democracy and that there should be some political compromise in the language that I use. And that's not right. ... Will I say that this election was not tainted, was not a disinvestment and a disenfranchisement of thousands of voters? I will not say that.""

Abrams maintained that ""it began eight years ago with the systematic disenfranchisement of more than a million voters and continued with the underfunding and disinvestment in polling places and training and in the management of the county delivery of services, and I think it had its pinnacle in this race.""

Tapper pointed out that while 1.5 million voters were removed from Georgia's voter rolls from 2012 to 2016 if they did not vote for three years, many other states -- as well as heavily liberal Washington, D.C. -- also strike inactive voters from the rolls as a matter of course.

""Maintaining clean voter rolls is absolutely appropriate,"" Abrams acknowledged. She then criticized the ""vigor with which [Kemp] did so -- and the mismanagement with which he did so."" She cited the unverified case of 92-year-old Christine Jordan, who was reportedly denied at the polls despite voting regularly.

With 100 percent of precincts tallied, Georgia's official election website showed Kemp had won 50.22% of total votes cast, or 1,978,408 votes. Abrams, by comparison, had 48.83 percent, or 1,923,685 -- meaning Kemp leads by approximately 55,000 votes. A runoff would have automatically triggered if neither candidate had won 50 percent of the vote.

HOURS BEFORE ELECTION DAY, SECRETARY OF STATE KEMP ANNOUNCES VOTER HACKING PROBE INTO GEORGIA DEMOCRATIC PARTY

Other top Democrats echoed Abrams' rhetoric. ""Democracy did not win in Georgia,"" former Attorney General Eric Holder tweeted Sunday morning.

Abrams insisted her complaints were based on ""facts,"" and pointed specifically to ""four different federal judges in the course of a week"" who ""forced better behavior"" among Georgia election officials prior to the midterms.

In one instance, shortly before Election Day, a federal judge appointed by former President Barack Obama, U.S. District Judge Eleanor Ross, ruled that the state's ""exact match"" law as a potential source of disenfranchisement and ordered the state to change its protocols.

Kemp had touted the law, which flags discrepancies between voter registrations and official identification documents. If there are any differences -- such as a missing hyphen -- voters had to clear the matter up with a state official before voting.

But those restrictions were estimated to affect only approximately 3,000 voters -- far short of the 55,000-vote margin that Kemp obtained on his way to victory.

Abrams also pointed to Kemp's decision to initiate a hacking investigation into the Georgia Democratic Party with just hours to go before Election Day.

Cori Bush won't drop 'defund the police' slogan even though Dems fear it's poison at the polls,"Rep. Cori Bush, D-Mo., is refusing to back away from the ""defund the police"" slogan, despite pushback from members of her own party who fear political consequences from its use.

""I always tell [fellow Democrats], 'If you all had fixed this before I got here, I wouldn’t have to say these things,'"" Bush told Axios Tuesday.

REP. BUSH NOT BACKING DOWN ON ‘DEFUND THE POLICE,’ SAYS CONGRESS INACTION HAS ‘COST LIVES’

The progressive ""Squad"" member's commitment to defunding the police comes amid growing concern about the 2022 midterm election among members of the Democratic Party, who fear ""defund the police"" rhetoric may have led to disappointing results in the 2020 election.

But Bush said that the party needs to do a better job of explaining to voters what it means by ""defund the police,"" arguing that some funding could be better spent on preemptive social services.

The Missouri Democrat also dismissed concerns about Democrats losing this year's election, saying a defeat should be blamed on the party's inability to pass sweeping reforms such as President Biden's Build Back Better legislation.

""'Defund the police' is not the problem,"" Bush said. ""We dangled the carrot in front of people’s faces and said we can get it done and that Democrats deliver, when we haven’t totally delivered.""

""If [Republicans] take the majority, it’s just done as far as trying to get the legislation across,"" she added.

Bush's comments come as violent crime has been on the rise throughout the U.S. in the past two years, with murders rising 5% last year and 44% since 2019, according to a Council on Criminal Justice study.

The rise in crime and 2020's difficult down-ballot election results have caused Democrats to attempt to distance the party from the ""defund the police"" movement, with Bush saying that some colleagues have told her the slogan is unhelpful in their districts.

Not all Democrats agree with Bush. Rep. Karen Bass, D-Calif., who is running for Mayor of Los Angeles, called for more police Tuesday, saying that residents of Los Angeles ""don't feel safe,"" while vowing to get the city's police department back to its 9,700 authorized officers.

""Whether you’ve had your car broken into, your backpack stolen, your property damaged — or you’ve seen news coverage of home robberies, or violent assaults — more and more Angelenos I speak with tell me crime has touched them personally, and they feel scared,"" Bass said, according to the Los Angeles Times.

Some in the party have discussed a piecemeal approach to larger police reform bills, such as the failed George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, but Bush argues there's little chance of seeing even small reforms come to fruition.

""If we couldn’t get George Floyd done back when millions of people were marching in the street, then how do we expect to get more than one thing done [on policing] over the next few years?"" Bush said.

Eric Adams spends coldest winter night in shelter after migrants refused to leave hotel,"New York City Mayor Eric Adams slept at a migrant facility in Brooklyn on the coldest night of 2023 to promote the new housing option after some migrants recently refused to leave a hotel.

""Spent the coldest night of the year at Brooklyn Cruise Terminal with ‘Homeless Hero’ and advocate Shams DaBaron & @AMEddieGibbs,"" Adams posted to Twitter on Saturday. ""Our brothers are being kept warm and the team working here is giving new meaning to the words 'love thy neighbor.'""

The mayor's post included video and photos of him at the facility, including showing him sleeping on a cot, dining with migrants and playing video games.

Adams said he chose the coldest night of 2023, when there was a low of 12 degrees in the city, to spend at the facility to show how warm and welcoming it is.

ILLEGAL MIGRANTS REFUSE TO LEAVE NYC HOTEL FOR BROOKLYN MIGRANT RELIEF CENTER, SLEEP IN THE STREET

""What we saw is what we have seen since the beginning of this crisis: individuals who are grateful to the greatest city in the world for providing them the opportunity to work toward the American Dream. I'd like to be clear that the facilities at the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal are providing the same services to asylum seekers as every other humanitarian relief center in the city, and the team at the terminal is giving new meaning to the words ‘love thy neighbor,’"" Adams said, WABC reported.

Late last month, a group of migrants who were staying at the Watson Hotel in Midtown Manhattan free of charge refused to leave the hotel – and even protested by sleeping in the streets – after city officials said they would be housed at the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal.

NYC MAYOR ERIC ADAMS PLEADS WITH WHITE HOUSE FOR MORE HELP ON MIGRANT CRISIS

Some of the migrants did leave the hotel for the migrant facility in Brooklyn, while others refused to leave and rallied outside the building alongside migrant activists.

Adams said at the time that the housing in Brooklyn was hospitable, despite claims that there was a lack of heat and bathroom space at the facility.

MAYOR ERIC ADAMS SAYS NYC HAS 'NO MORE ROOM' FOR ASYLUM SEEKERS

""This weekend, we began the process of moving single adult men from the Watson Hotel to Brooklyn Cruise Terminal, as we transition the hotel to meet the large number of asylum-seeking families with children,"" Adams said in a statement at the time.

""More than 42,000 asylum seekers have arrived in New York City since last spring, and we continue to surpass our moral obligations as we provide asylum seekers with shelter, food, health care, education, and a host of other services,"" the mayor continued.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott set off a firestorm of criticisms from Democratic leaders in New York last year when he ordered buses of migrants be taken from overwhelmed border communities to various northern ""sanctuary cities,"" including the Big Apple.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis suspends 'Soros-backed' state attorney who refused to enforce abortion ban,"Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis suspended liberal State Attorney Andrew Warren on Thursday.

DeSantis made the announcement during a press conference broadcast on social media. DeSantis argued that Warren has repeatedly refused to enforce laws passed by the legislature cracking down on child sex change surgeries and abortion restrictions.

""We are suspending Soros-backed 13th circuit state attorney Andrew Warren for neglecting his duties as he pledges not to uphold the laws of the state,"" DeSantis' office said in a statement. The 13th circuit falls over Florida's Hillsborough County.

""The constitution of Florida has vested the veto power in the governor, not in state attorneys,"" DeSantis said. ""We are not going to allow this pathogen of ignoring the law get a foothold in the state of Florida.""

DESANTIS LAUNCHES FIRST TV AD OF HIS FLORIDA GUBERNATORIAL RE-ELECTION CAMPAIGN

‘THE VIEW’: HERE'S HOW RON DESANTIS’ POLITICAL TEAM RESPONDED TO INVITE FROM ABC TALK SHOW

Officials said Warren has repeatedly tried to install himself as an adjudicator of what laws will and will not be enforced.

DeSantis' office had teased the move on Wednesday, saying the announcement would not be political or related to endorsements.

""This isn't about abortion or any one thing, it's about having accountability to our system of law and order to prosecute crime. There has been a pattern developing in Hillsborough County where one person picks and chooses which laws he wishes to enforce,"" his office stated.

Warren responded in a statement Thursday afternoon.

""Today's political stunt is an illegal overreach that continues a dangerous pattern by Ron DeSantis of using his office to further his own political ambition. It spits in the face of the voters of Hillsborough County who have twice elected me to serve them, not Ron DeSantis,"" Warren said.

""In our community, crime is low, our Constitutional rights—including the right to privacy—are being upheld, and the people have the right to elect their own leaders—not have them dictated by an aspiring presidential candidate who has shown time and again he feels accountable to no one,"" he added.

""Just because the governor violates your rights, it doesn’t mean they don’t exist.""

Garland refuses to back away from DOJ memo after school board apology,"Attorney General Merrick Garland doubled down on his memo to Department of Justice employees addressing a federal response to violence and intimidation of school board officials — despite the National School Boards Association apologizing for the letter that inspired the memo.

Appearing on Capitol Hill for the second time in two weeks, Garland told the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday that the NSBA's second letter – which contained an apology for inflammatory language in the first one – had no bearing on the DOJ's stance.

MCCARTHY DEMANDS AG GARLAND RETRACT MEMO URGING FBI TO INVESTIGATE PARENTS WHO THREATEN SCHOOL BOARDS

""The letter that was subsequently sent does not change the association’s concern of violence or threats of violence. It alters some of the language in the letter … that we did not rely on and is not contained in my own memorandum,"" Garland said after committee chairman Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., asked if he had ""second thoughts"" following the apology.

Garland claimed that the DOJ is not just concerned about school board officials, but a ""rising tide"" of violence against judges, prosecutors, election administrators, and others.

""The only thing the Justice Department is concerned about: violence and threats of violence,"" he said.

The committee's ranking member, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, claimed that the DOJ memo had a ""poisonous, chilling effect"" on speech, as it specifically dealt with opposition to school board officials. When he appeared before the House Judiciary Committee last week, Garland acknowledged the influence of the NSBA's original letter, which cited instances including non-violent behavior that did not include threats, but that was deemed disruptive.

The NSBA had called for the use of measures including the PATRIOT Act, which is typically used to address terrorism. Their second letter said they ""regret and apologize for the letter,"" stating that ""there was no justification for some of the language"" that they had used.

""I assume you’re going to revoke your extremely divisive memo that you said was instigated because of that letter?"" Grassley asked.

Garland defended the memo, claiming that it was a response ""to concerns about violence, threats of violence, other criminal conduct.""

""That’s all it’s about,"" he continued, ""and all it asks is for federal law enforcement to consult with, meet with local law enforcement to assess the circumstances, strategize about what may or may not be necessary to provide federal assistance if it’s necessary.""

Early in the hearing, Grassley also chastised Garland for the DOJ's failure to respond to his requests for information. These requests have had to do with issues related to Hunter Biden, including a 2018 incident involving a firearm, and Chinese nationals Grassley said were linked to the Chinese government as well as the Biden family. The senator said this included Patrick Ho, who had ties to Chinese intelligence and Hunter Biden.

Grassley said that even though the DOJ said in court filings that they have FISA info related to Ho, the Department responded to Grassley's request by saying that they could not confirm whether such information even existed.

SEVENTEEN STATES ASK BIDEN, GARLAND TO STOP INTIMIDATING PARENTS INTO SILENCE AT SCHOOL BOARD MEETINGS

During his appearance before members of the House, Reps. Tom McClintock, R-Calif., and Ken Buck, R-Colo., asked Garland whether a special counsel should be appointed to investigate Hunter Biden and his finances.

Buck noted how a piece of Hunter's artwork was sold for $500,000, which he argued was thanks to familial ties.

Garland said he could not comment, saying there is an ongoing federal investigation of Hunter Biden.

Another topic, broached by Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., had to do with Dr. Anthony Fauci. Cotton referred to Fauci’s May 11 testimony in which he said that his agency, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, does not has never funded gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The senator then noted that the NIAID admitted last week that they had indeed funded such research.

""Are you investigating Tony Fauci for lying to Congress?"" Cotton asked.

Garland responded by pointing out that it is DOJ custom not to comment on pending or potential investigations. When Cotton asked if he thought Fauci had been truthful, Garland said it was ""outside of my scope of knowledge.""

Cotton then brought the conversation back to the school board memo, chastising the attorney general for his directive. The senator noted that Garland has cited news reports – in addition to a letter from the National School Boards Association – as inspiring his memo. Cotton then brought up one of the more high-profile instances of a parent being arrested for conduct at a school board meeting, where Scott Smith was charged with disorderly conduct after demanding answers regarding how his daughter was raped in a girls’ bathroom at school by a boy who had reportedly been wearing women’s clothing.

""That letter and those reports were the basis for your directive,"" Cotton said. ""This is shameful. Judge, this is shameful. This testimony, your directive, your performance is shameful. Thank God you are not on the Supreme Court. You should resign in disgrace, judge.""

In response to Cotton’s diatribe, Garland insisted that the news reports cited by the NSBA – including the Smith case – were not the news reports that influenced him in issuing his directive.

Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, then defended Garland’s memo, saying ""it is a fact"" that there has been a rise in violence against school board officials. She too mentioned the Supreme Court, but in the context of accusing it of being ""weaponized to support the position of the most conservative causes.""

Cotton was not the only one during the hearing to call on Garland to resign. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., had the same demand, one he initially leveled Friday, pointing during the hearing to a memo from a federal prosecutor in Montana that included a list of possible federal crimes related to harassment and intimidation. Hawley noted that while Garland has repeatedly said that his memo was about violence and threats of violence, it also refers to harassment and intimidation.

BIDEN ADMIN GIVES POST TO NATIONAL SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION CHIEF WHO SIGNED ‘DOMESTIC TERRORISM’ LETTER

""The Supreme Court has made quite clear that the word ‘intimidation’ with respect to the constitutional protection, is one that directs a threat to a person with the intent of placing the victim in fear of bodily harm or death.,"" Garland said, adding that prosecutors who pursue such cases know this.

""Prosecutors do, but parents don't,"" Hawley said.

Garland then said he had not seen the memo Hawley referred to.

""All I can conclude from this,"" Hawley continued, ""is that either that you're not in control of your own department, or that, more likely what I think to be the case is that you knew full well that this is exactly the kind of thing that would happen.""

Nevertheless, the attitudes of Boebert and Gaetz shows a very real divide within the GOP regarding whether and how to proceed with further aid to Ukraine.

Whitmer refuses to answer question about who paid for private plane for her trip to Florida,"Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer refused to answer a reporter’s question asking who paid for the private jet she used to visit her father in Florida during her statewide travel advisories.

Whitmer was asked on Thursday by WWTV reporter Eric Lloyd for a response to the recent report by journalist Charlie LeDuff in Deadline Detroit that the governor approached wealthy businessmen in Detroit to use the private plane they share.

The embattled governor — who is facing down both the Florida travel scandal and the COVID-19 nursing home scandal in her state — declined to answer Lloyd's question.

""Listen, I’ve said everything I’m going to say about my trip to go check on my father,"" Whitmer said. ""It was a quick trip, there was an important family reason for doing it, and I’ve got nothing to add.""

MICHIGAN GOV. WHITMER TO RECEIVE JFK ‘PROFILE IN COURAGE’ AWARD DESPITE RECENT COVID-19 SURGE

When pressed by Lloyd on why the governor and her office were being ""very secretive"" about the trip, Whitmer said that her office doesn’t discuss her travel plans.

""We don’t discuss my travel. I have received an incredible number of death threats over the last year and a half,"" Whitmer said. ""There are a lot of reasons that we don’t discuss how I travel, when I travel, and that is all I’m going to say at this point.""

The governor shot down a third question by the reporter as to the dates of her trip, responding, ""I told you I’ve said everything I’m going to say about that right now.""

Whitmer’s office did not immediately respond to Fox News’ request for comment.

MICHIGAN GOV. WHITMER HAMMERED OVER NURSING HOME POLICY BY LOCAL TV STATION: ‘A LOT OF MICHIGANDERS DIED’

""Governor Whitmer's refusal to say who paid for her controversial trip to Florida is another example of her 'rules for thee but not for me' mantra,"" said Michigan Rising Action executive director Tori Sachs in a Thursday press release. ""The people of Michigan deserve to know who paid for Whitmer's trip to Florida.""

Republican Governors Association spokesman Chris Gustafson told Fox News on Thursday that Whitmer refusing to give key information regarding her trip raises questions.

""Gretchen Whitmer’s refusal to disclose key details about her sabbatical to Florida is raising additional questions about her lack of transparency and adherence to her own rules,"" said Gustafson. ""Dodging media requests and stonewalling reporters is a far cry from the candidate who promised more transparency. Michiganders deserve better than Whitmer.""

The Deadline Detroit report also noted that Whitmer had used the private jet to travel to Florida for four days, rather than two, as her office had originally stated.

MICHIGAN GOV. WHITMER LIED ABOUT TRAVELS BEFORE FLORIDA TRIP REVEALED: ‘I WAS HERE IN TOWN THE WHOLE TIME’

Michigan Republican Party executive director Jason Roe told the outlet that Whitmer is ""compounding her lies"" by not revealing the details of her trip.

""Governor Whitmer lied about her trip to Florida and is compounding her lies by refusing to disclose the cost of the private plane she used, if she paid for her personal trip, and what the fair market value of that payment was,"" Roe said.

""She ran a campaign based on transparency (her so-called Sunshine Plan) but has been the most opaque governor in Michigan history. I guess by 'sunshine' she meant the Sunshine State.""

The report also revealed that Whitmer was unvaccinated at the time of travel, when she had warned the people of her state against traveling due to a spike in COVID-19.

""She said she was going to see her sick daddy, but that's not a legitimate political expenditure,"" Mongo said. ""What it is, is a political favor. She asked. She got on their plane. Now she owes them one.""

"Hirono, Blumenthal say they won’t meet with Amy Coney Barrett","Two Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee said they will not meet with Amy Coney Barrett -- President Trump’s pick to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court.

Trump announced on Saturday evening that he intends to nominate Barrett to fill the vacancy on the nation’s highest court after the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg last week.

TRUMP ANNOUNCES AMY CONEY BARRETT AS NOMINEE FOR SUPREME COURT SEAT

Democrats indicated that they will oppose Barrett’s nomination, citing her conservative credentials which they see as a threat to health care and abortion rights, while also arguing that it is too close to Election Day for Trump to nominate a justice.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee and will play a role in confirmation hearings, said he would oppose her confirmation “as I would any nominee proposed as part of this illegitimate sham process, barely one month before an election as Americans are already casting their votes.”

""If Judge Barrett’s views become law, hundreds of millions of Americans living w/pre-existing conditions would lose access to their health care. In the middle of a pandemic, rushing confirmation of an extreme jurist who will decimate health care is unconscionable,"" he said on Twitter.

“I will refuse to treat this process as legitimate & will not meet with Judge Amy Coney Barrett,” he tweeted.

BIDEN SAYS SENATE SHOULD NOT ACT ON AMY CONEY BARRETT SUPREME COURT NOMINATION UNTIL AFTER ELECTION

Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, also said that she would not meet with Barrett when asked on CNN, although she said she would question her at the hearing.

“I will not be meeting with her, I will take the opportunity to question her when she is under oath,” she said.

Republicans are unlikely to be too concerned by Democrats not meeting with Barrett, having indicated they have the votes, both in the Senate Judiciary Committee and in the Senate chamber, to confirm Barrett along party lines before the election.

So far, only Sens. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Susan Collins, R-Maine, have indicated they oppose moving forward with a confirmation before the election. Murkowski has since suggested she still may vote for the nominee.

With 53 votes in the Senate, there would need to be three Republican defections for there to be a tie, which would be broken then by Vice President Mike Pence.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hirono-blumenthal-amy-coney-barrett,N/A
"House report: Cash-strapped IRS prioritized bonuses, union activity over helping taxpayers","While facing budget cuts, the IRS nevertheless prioritized worker bonuses, union activity and the implementation of President Obama’s health care law over assisting taxpayers during tax season, according to a new report released Wednesday by the House Ways and Means Committee.

The findings, in a Republican-led report, were released ahead of a subcommittee hearing Wednesday morning with IRS Commissioner John Koskinen.

At the hearing, Koskinen stressed that the agency is significantly under-funded, and those cuts have consequences.

He said less funding means there will be a decline in service for taxpayers, and pledged that service would improve if they got more money.

""Customer service -- both on the phone and in person -- has been far worse than anyone would want. It's simply a matter of not having enough people to answer the phones and provide service at our walk-in sites as a result of cuts to our budget,"" he said.

More On This...

But Republicans argued the IRS is making bad spending choices. ""I would just suggest to you that there's hardly a person in America today that isn't doing more with less, that hasn't tightened their belt and learned how to work with less,"" Rep. Mike Kelly, R-Pa., said.

The IRS has faced congressional budget cuts of $1.2 billion since 2010, and has faced criticism in recent years over the targeting of conservative groups applying for tax-exempt status and reports of wasteful spending. The new report said the cuts were intended to “force the IRS to manage its resources more effectively and immediately stop inappropriate activities.”

However, while cuts were made in part to focus the agency on customer service, the report asserted that “spending decisions entirely under the IRS’s control led to 16 million fewer taxpayers receiving IRS assistance this filing season.”

The panel found the IRS had cut customer services while continuing to hand out bonuses to employees, allowing staff to conduct union activities, failing to collect debt owed by employees of the federal government and spending over $1.2 billion on implementing ObamaCare.

Even though the IRS’s budget for taxpayer assistance remained flat from fiscal year 2014 to 2015, the level of over-the-phone customer service significantly decreased, with the agency shifting staff in customer service to focus on written correspondence instead of telephone calls. Meanwhile, the number of calls doubled in that period.

The panel found that wait times increased from 18.7 minutes to 34.4 minutes, and answered calls decreased from 6.6 million to 5.3 million.

“In January 2015, the IRS commissioner estimated that taxpayer service would decline while delays in tax refunds would increase. While the IRS commissioner has blamed this solely on budget cuts, in reality the IRS deliberately diverted resources away from taxpayer services,” the report found.

Despite the drop in service, there was no significant decrease in bonuses for IRS employees. Notably, in November 2014, despite another round of budget cuts at the IRS, Koskinen announced that employees would receive bonuses at the same level as for the previous year, unless they had substantiated conduct issues, the report said.

While acknowledging that the agency has cut the amount of time spent on discretionary union activity, the report questioned why it could not have been decreased further, asserting that “the amount of resources spent on discretionary union activity could have assisted nearly 2.5 million taxpayers.”

The report noted that while the IRS’s implementation of ObamaCare was deemed a success by Koskinen, “the IRS achieved this supposed success by prioritizing … implementation over other activities, including core responsibilities like taxpayer assistance.”

The panel also claimed the agency had failed to pursue recommendations for streamlining and reducing waste and abuse. It concluded that what it called “large areas of systemic waste and inefficiency” present in 2010 remained unaddressed in 2015, and highlighted in particular that the IRS spent $2.1 million on litigation services that the government could have conducted itself.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-report-cash-strapped-irs-prioritized-bonuses-union-activity-over-helping-taxpayers,N/A
"Illegal migrants refuse to leave NYC hotel for Brooklyn migrant relief center, sleep in the street","A group of illegal migrants, who entered into the U.S. through the southern border, are refusing to leave their free NYC hotel rooms for a migrant shelter in Brooklyn, New York, sleeping in the street to protest.

The migrants were initially placed at the Watson Hotel in Midtown Manhattan, but their schedule for relocation to a new migrant relief center, the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal, caused uproar late Sunday night.

While some migrants left for the new shelter, many refused to vacate the Hell's Kitchen hotel and rallied outside the building alongside migrant activists. The migrants who were noncompliant in the city's relocation spent the night outside the hotel and were seen holding their ground into Monday morning.

Democrat Mayor Eric Adams responded to the situation, affirming that the new facilities were hospitable accommodations and noting the dire need of state and government support amid the ongoing migrant crisis that is impacting the Big Apple.

NEARLY 300,000 ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS SLIPPED PAST BORDER AGENTS IN LESS THAN FOUR MONTHS: SOURCES

""This weekend, we began the process of moving single adult men from the Watson Hotel to Brooklyn Cruise Terminal, as we transition the hotel to meet the large number of asylum-seeking families with children,"" Adams said in a statement.

""More than 42,000 asylum seekers have arrived in New York City since last spring, and we continue to surpass our moral obligations as we provide asylum seekers with shelter, food, health care, education, and a host of other services,"" the mayor continued.

GREG ABBOTT BLASTS BIDEN'S NEW BORDER POLICY THAT WILL ALLEGEDLY ATTRACT ‘EVEN MORE’ ILLEGAL MIGRANTS

Several migrants who went to the new center immediately turned around and went back to the Watson Hotel, claiming there was a lack of heat and bathroom space at the facility.

Despite these claims, the city assured that the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal provided the same services for the migrants seeking asylum, including heat and space.

""The facilities at Brooklyn Cruise Terminal will provide the same services as every other humanitarian relief center in the city, and the scheduled relocations to Brooklyn Cruise Terminal this weekend took place as planned. We remain in serious need of support from both our state and federal governments.""

The Brooklyn Cruise Terminal Humanitarian Emergency Response and Relief Center was scheduled to open after Adams said NYC had reached ""its breaking point."" The center, which will close this spring ahead of cruise season, will ""provide adult men with a place to stay, access support, and get to their final destination.""

Illegal migrants are continuing to flood into New York City on a weekly basis, with Adams reporting an average of 400 people each day during one week in January, with 835 asylum seekers arriving on one single day alone earlier this month.

30% of immigrants in ICE custody refused COVID-19 vaccine,"Almost one-third of immigrants detained in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody have refused the opportunity to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, according to agency statistics.

An ICE official confirmed to Fox News that the vaccine declination rate in all ICE detention centers is 30%.

FENTANYL SEIZURES INCREASE AGAIN AT SOUTHERN BORDER, NOW 78% HIGHER THAN LAST FISCAL YEAR

According to current ICE data, there are 1,182 positive cases among 27,067 detainees in custody.

The ongoing crisis at the southern border has raised concern about possible infection not only for migrants who frequently travel to the border in cramped and unsanitary conditions, but also for ICE and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) staff and then into the public at large if they are released into the U.S.

The Biden administration has been aggressively urging all who are eligible to get a vaccine amid a spike in cases originating from the delta variant. According to Axios, which first reported the declination rate, ICE recently began distributing an initial allotment of 10,000 doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and that more than 9,500 doses have been distributed so far.

GEORGE P BUSH WARNS BORDER CRISIS IS ‘NOT SUSTAINABLE’ AS HE SUES BIDEN OVER WALL, HITS DEMS FOR FLEEING

The vaccination declination rate is likely to further fuel concerns about the relation to the surge at the border and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Many of those in ICE custody are recent border crossers, although it also detains those who already live in the country illegally and who the agency is seeking to deport.

The Trump administration implemented Title 42 public health protections at the start of the pandemic, which turned back migrants rapidly in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The Biden administration has not been turning back unaccompanied children and some family units.

Outlets have reported that the Biden administration is considering ending Title 42 for migrant families, and possibly for single adults, as well. The administration has said its decision will be decided by science and guided by experts.

"IRS official on leave refused to resign, GOP senator says","First she refused to testify. Now Lois Lerner, the IRS official at the center of the tax agency scandal, is refusing to resign, according to a top Republican senator.

Sources confirmed to Fox News earlier Thursday that Lerner, the head of the IRS division that oversaw the unit targeting conservative groups, had been placed on administrative leave, with pay.

But Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, claimed she was only put in that status after refusing to step down.

He said the commissioner was in his right to demand her resignation, and said taxpayers should not continue to pay her salary indefinitely.

“My understanding is the new acting IRS commissioner asked for Ms. Lerner’s resignation, and she refused to resign. She was then put on administrative leave instead,” Grassley said in a statement. “The IRS owes it to taxpayers to resolve her situation quickly. The agency needs to move on to fix the conditions that led to the targeting debacle.""

Capitol Hill sources said Lerner, the director of exempt organizations, was placed on paid leave Thursday, amid calls from some lawmakers for her to be suspended or fired. In her absence, Ken Corbin, the current deputy director of the submission processing, wage and investment division, will take over her duties, according to an internal IRS memo obtained by Fox News.

Lerner, the official who first acknowledged the controversial IRS practice earlier this month, asserted her innocence at a House hearing on Wednesday. She then refused to testify, citing her Fifth Amendment right against self incrimination. The move angered many who say she should have been forced to answer why the tax agency targeted conservative groups applying for tax exempt status.

Republican leaders of that committee, though, now say she waived that right by giving a statement and want to haul her back to testify.

Pressure has been mounting on the administration to take tough action against Lerner, after two other IRS officials were pushed out in the wake of the scandal.

In a letter earlier Thursday to IRS Acting Commissioner Daniel Werfel, Sens. Carl Levin, D-Mich., and John McCain, R-Ariz., asked the agency to remove Lerner from office and said they had “lost confidence in her ability to fulfill her duties.”

It's unclear whether Republicans will succeed in trying to recall her before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., chairman of the panel, said through an aide Thursday that her Fifth Amendment assertion is ""no longer valid,"" since she delivered remarks at the start of Wednesday's hearing.

That hearing was never technically adjourned, and Republicans hope to bring her back.

Others, though, say she was in her right to defend herself and subsequently invoke the right to remain silent.

The IRS has had a series of missteps that have not only publicly marred the reputation of the IRS, but also called into question what the White House knew about the scandal and when they knew it.

Separately, Tea Party-related groups who claim they were targeted by the tax agency have started filing lawsuits this week against the IRS. In some cases they are asking for the IRS to admit wrongdoing. In others, they are seeking monetary claims.

""It's extremely troubling that it has taken this long for Lois Lerner to removed from the top exempt position at the IRS,” Jay Sekulow, chief counsel of the American Center for Law and Justice, the group suing on behalf of some Tea Party groups, said in a statement to FoxNews.com.

Sekulow said instead of putting Lerner on administrative leave, his group is calling for her to be fired.

Jimmy Fallon defends choice to not join anti-Trump bandwagon,"NBC’s Jimmy Fallon is defending his decision to keep his show from becoming an anti-Trump crusade like other late night hosts have, saying many of the president’s words and actions are just “too serious” for joke fodder.

“With Trump, it’s just like every day’s a new thing. He gives a lot of material. A lot of stuff is hard to even make a joke about,” Fallon said in a preview of an NBC “Today” show interview to air Sunday. “It’s just too serious.”

Too be sure, several late-night TV hosts have, since essentially the start of Trump’s winning 2016 White House bid, made attacking and satirizing the president a big part of their monologues.

Among them are Steven Colbert, host of the CBS' “Late Show,” and Jimmy Kimmel, of ABC’s “Jimmy Kimmel Live!”

But while Colbert has long been associated with political satire, including his days with Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show,” then the “Colbert Report,” Kimmel appears to have seized on the anti-Trump movement, which has coincided with a rating spike.

However, the decision by ""The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon"" not to get on the anti-Trump bandwagon appears to have hurt the show's ratings.

Fallon is No. 2 to start the fall season, behind Colbert and ahead of Kimmel. Aside from losing the top spot, viewership is down 31 percent compared to this time last year, according to the most recent Hollywood Reporter numbers.

Fallon argues on the “Today” segment that he’s made jokes about Obama and Trump. And he said he will always make jokes about a president” but “it’s just not what I do.”

“I think it would be weird for me to start doing it now. I don’t really even care that much about politics.”

Kimmel, also his show’s executive producer, has perhaps most infamously publicized his infant child’s illness to attack Trump’s efforts to dismantle ObamaCare.

Trump last week criticized the late-night hosts for their attacks.

""Late-night host are dealing with the Democrats for their very ‘unfunny’ & repetitive material. Always anti-Trump! Should we get equal time,” he tweeted.

When Fallon was asked about whether he felt pressure to do Trump jokes, he replied: “I think the other guys are doing it very well. Colbert’s doing great. I mean, that’s what he’s good at. … I think when it’s organic I’ll dip into it.”",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/jimmy-fallon-defends-choice-to-not-join-anti-trump-bandwagon,N/A
"Judge refuses to dismiss Flynn case, petitions full appellate court","Washington, D.C. federal District Judge Emmett Sullivan is refusing to dismiss the criminal case against former national security advisor Michael Flynn, and is now arguing that the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals erred when it ordered him to do so last month in a 2-1 ruling.

Sullivan, through his attorney Beth Wilkinson, filed a petition on Thursday for a so-called ""en banc"" review by the entire D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, arguing that the three-judge panel was improperly trying to force the district court ""to grant a motion [to dismiss] it had not yet resolved ... in reliance on arguments never presented to the district court.""

Flynn's lawyer, Sidney Powell, successfully sought a writ of mandamus last month from the three-judge panel on the appellate court ordering Sullivan to toss the case. Writs of mandamus are unusual remedies that order government officials to take a certain action; they are appropriate when there has been a ""usurpation of judicial power"" that is ""clear and indisputable,"" Powell acknowledged.

Powell, whose argument was supported by the Justice Department, primarily asserted that the constitutional separation of powers, and D.C. Circuit case law, clearly holds that judges cannot unilaterally keep prosecutions alive when both the prosecutors and the defense seek to dismiss charges. The DOJ moved to dismiss the Flynn case earlier this year after a slew of exculpatory information, which the government acknowledged should have been disclosed long ago under a standing court order, was finally turned over to the defense team.

READ THE JUDGE'S PETITION FOR EN BANC REVIEW

But, the circuit court's panel decision ordering the dismissal of the case, Sullivan argued, was premature, and threatened to turn ""mandamus into an ordinary litigation tool.""

""All the district court has done is ensure adversarial briefing and an opportunity to ask questions about a pending motion,"" Sullivan's motion reads. ""Outside the panel opinion, those actions have not been considered inappropriate—much less an extreme separation-of-powers violation justifying mandamus.""

If en banc review is granted, an oral argument date would then be set, likely in the fall. If en banc review is denied, Sullivan could appeal to the Supreme Court -- a process that could take months to resolve, past Election Day.

The Department of Justice has agreed with Powell's arguments, saying in court filings that Sullivan risked compromising the separation of powers between the executive and judicial branches.

""This Court should issue a writ of mandamus compelling dismissal,"" the DOJ wrote in a filing signed by Solicitor General Noel Francisco last month, who ordinarily represents the government before the Supreme Court. Francisco's imprimatur was significant, and indicated the DOJ was taking Sullivan's actions seriously.

BOMBSHELL FLYNN DOCS DROP PROMPT NEW REVIEW ..... SULLIVAN HINTS DOJ MAY BE BIASED

""Under Articles II and III of the Constitution, the power to prosecute belongs to the Executive, not the Judiciary,"" the government continued. ""Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 48, read against the backdrop of that constitutional principle, required the district court to grant the government's motion to dismiss the indictment with prejudice because that motion was unopposed."" That rule of procedure states: ""The government may, with leave of court, dismiss an indictment, information, or complaint.""

In her own filings, Powell heavily cited the 2016 D.C. Circuit court case United States v. Fokker Services for the proposition that a ""district court cannot deny the Government’s motion to dismiss because the judge has 'a disagreement with the prosecution’s exercise of charging authority,' such as 'a view that the defendant should stand trial' or 'that more serious charges should be brought.'"" The DOJ filed its own brief backing up Powell, and appellate panel largely argreed in its ruling.

But on Thursday, Sullivan essentially said the ""Fokker"" citation wasn't applicable. He argued, in seeking en banc review, that ""[the] Fokker [case] did not question the process the district court employed in reaching [its] erroneous decision."" Specifically, Sullivan's filing asserted that the Fokker court expressly declined to apply its reasoning to less ""formal judicial action,"" and that Sullivan was merely considering his options as to how to proceed with the Flynn case -- which, Sullivan said, was allowed under current precedent.

Ryan Fayhee, an attorney at Hughes Hubbard & Reed who previously served as a top prosecutor and national security official at the DOJ, told Fox News the Fokker case was indeed distinguishable from the facts of the Flynn case.

Fokker ""concerned a deferred prosecution agreement, and not a knowing and voluntary guilty plea,"" Fayhee said, in an argument echoed by Sullivan's filing on Thursday. ""In that case the judge’s role was ministerial and limited to whether the Speedy Trial Act could be extended in the interest of justice; it did not consider whether the Justice Department may dismiss a case post-plea (an unprecedented and novel issue); nor whether a district court judge may initiate a contempt proceeding as is being considered here.""

Sullivan pointed to the 1973 D.C. Circuit case United States v. Ammidown for the precedent that even where the defendant ""concurs"" in the dismissal of a case, it was appropriate for judge's to ""obtain and evaluate"" prosecutors' reasoning, to better serve the ""public interest."" Democrats, and even Sullivan's attorney, have suggested political bias could be behind the DOJ's decision to seek dismissal.

Even if Ammidown was improperly decided, Sullivan said in the brief, mandamus was not the appropriate remedy to resolve the matter.

However, Ammidown's case law concerning motions to dismiss is ""dicta,"" or nonbinding on future courts, because it was not central to the case's final holding. The Ammidown court noted that ""Rule 48(a) [governing motions to dismiss] does not apply as such to the case at bar, but study of the judicial role in dismissals illuminates our course.""

The ruling by the three-judge panel that agreed with Powell and the DOJ had expressly ordered that Flynn’s petition for a writ of mandamus ""be granted in part; the District Court is directed to grant the government’s ... motion to dismiss; and the District Court’s order appointing an amicus is hereby vacated as moot, in accordance with the opinion of the court filed herein this date.""

The DOJ, Powell said, had ample reason to seek the dismissal of Flynn's case, in light of newly released exculpatory information. ""Now additional facts have established he was not interviewed for a legitimate purpose, and therefore any statements he made were not 'material' under 18 U.S.C. §1001, the Government justly believes that he is not guilty of any crime,"" Powell wrote in a filing last month.

For example, handwritten notes that surfaced earlier this year -- written by Bill Priestap after a meeting with then-FBI Director James Comey and then-FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe -- suggested that agents planned to interview Flynn at the White House on January 24, 2017 ""to get him to lie, so we can prosecute him or get him fired.""

In the alternative, Priestap's note suggested that a possible goal was to get Flynn ""to admit to breaking the Logan Act"" when he spoke to Russia's then-Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the presidential transition period.

The Logan Act has never been successfully used in a criminal prosecution and has a questionable constitutional status; it was enacted in 1799 in an era before telephones, and was intended to prevent individuals from falsely claiming to represent the United States government abroad.

Priestap's memo surfaced this summer even though the Justice Department and FBI had been under an obligation to turn over all relevant, potentially exculpatory materials to Flynn's legal team since February 2018.

Attorney General Bill Barr had appointed U.S. Attorney Jeff Jensen to review the DOJ's handling of the Flynn case, and Jensen apparently unearthed the documents.

Justice Department files suit against Arizona sheriff Arpaio,"The Obama administration announced Thursday that it is suing Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio, accusing him and his Maricopa County office of engaging in a pattern of discrimination against Latinos.

The announcement by Justice Department officials came after months of negotiations failed to yield an agreement to settle claims that his department racially profiled Latinos in his trademark immigration patrols. Arpaio defended himself in response, claiming the federal government is trying to tell him how to run his office.

Assistant Attorney General Thomas Perez, at a press conference Thursday, described this as an abuse of power case. He accused the sheriff of scuttling negotiations by refusing to allow independent monitors.

The Department of Justice lawsuit marked an escalation in the agency's civil rights investigation of Arpaio and puts the dispute on track to be decided by a federal judge.

The DOJ first leveled the allegations against Arpaio in December, saying that a culture of disregard for basic constitutional rights prevailed at the Maricopa County sheriff's office, which covers metro Phoenix. Federal officials held off on filing a lawsuit as they tried to reach a settlement, but talks broke off last month.

At the time, Arpaio refused to agree to a court-appointed monitor who would help enforce a settlement. Arpaio said it would mean every policy decision would have to be cleared through an observer and would nullify his authority.

At a news conference Wednesday, after DOJ officials notified him of their intent to sue, Arpaio defended himself.

""If they sue, we'll go to court,"" he said. ""And then we'll find out the real story. They're telling me how to run my organization. I'd like to get this resolved, but I'm not going to give up my authority to the federal government. It's as simple as that.""

Arpaio's office is also accused of punishing Hispanic jail inmates for speaking Spanish and launching some patrols based on complaints about dark-skinned people congregating in a given area or speaking Spanish. A crime was never reported.

The DOJ has been seeking an agreement requiring Arpaio's office to train officers in how to make constitutional traffic stops, collect data on people arrested in traffic stops and assure Latinos that the department is there to also protect them.

""Constitutional policing is an essential element of effective law enforcement,"" according to the DOJ lawsuit. The sheriff's office ""and Arpaio's conduct is neither constitutional nor effective law enforcement.""

One of the examples cited in the lawsuit was a Latino woman who is a U.S. citizen and was 5-months pregnant when she was stopped as she pulled into her driveway.

When the woman refused to sit on the hood of a car as the officer insisted, the officer pulled her arms behind her back, slammed her stomach first into the vehicle three times and dragged her to his patrol car. He shoved her into the back seat and made her wait for about 30 minutes without air conditioning, the lawsuit said.

Eventually, the woman was cited for failure to provide proof of insurance, but the matter was resolved when she provided such proof to a court, the lawsuit said.

The sheriff has said the investigation was a politically motivated attack by the Obama administration, denied allegations of systematic discriminatory policing and insisted that the Justice Department provide facts to prove its allegations. The Justice Department has said a 22-page letter it sent to Arpaio in December provided those details.

Arpaio is a national political fixture who built his reputation on jailing inmates in tents and dressing them in pink underwear, selling himself to voters as unceasingly tough on crime. Along the way, he aggressively pushed for a stronger role for local police to confront illegal immigration, launching 20 patrols looking for illegal immigrants since January 2008.

During the patrols, deputies flood an area of a city -- in some cases, heavily Latino areas -- over several days to seek out traffic violators and arrest other suspected offenders. Over the last three years, he also raided 58 businesses suspected of breaking a state law by knowingly hiring illegal immigrants.

Earlier in the three-year investigation, the Justice Department filed a lawsuit against Arpaio, alleging his office refused to fully cooperate with a request for records and access to jails and employees. That 2010 case was settled last summer after the sheriff's office handed over records and gave access to employees and jails.

Separate from the Justice Department's allegations, a lawsuit that alleges that Arpaio's deputies racially profiled Latinos in immigration patrols is scheduled for a July 19 trial in federal court.

A federal grand jury also has been investigating Arpaio's office on criminal abuse-of-power allegations since at least December 2009 and is specifically examining the investigative work of the sheriff's anti-public corruption squad..

Are more classified Biden docs out there? Karine Jean-Pierre dodges question,"White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre is staying mum on whether all classified documents have been recovered from President Biden or whether searches are still underway after additional documents were discovered since she assured reporters the searches were complete last week.

""You should assume it has been completed, yes,"" Jean-Pierre said during Thursday’s press briefing, later adding, ""The search is complete.""

Two days later, White House lawyer Richard Sauber issued a Saturday statement saying he went to Biden's Wilmington, Delaware, home Thursday evening and found more classified documents after other documents were previously discovered there in December. Classified documents were also found at Biden's private office at the Penn Biden Center in November, just days before the midterm elections. The developments only became public this month after CBS News broke the story and the White House was forced to respond.

On Tuesday, Jean-Pierre was repeatedly asked to defend her comments days earlier and to clarify whether the searches were continuing.

HUNTER BIDEN, CHINA, CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS: MYSTERY SWIRLS AROUND PENN BIDEN CENTER

""Is it safe to assume now that all the documents that had been recovered, all the official records, all the classified documents are back in the custody of the National Archives, or are more searches underway to find out if there’s anything else there?"" one reporter asked.

Jean-Pierre refused to answer the question and repeatedly referred reporters to the White House special counsel.

""I'm just going to continue to be prudent here,"" she said. ""I'm going to let this ongoing review that is happening, this legal process that is happening and let that process continue under the special counsel. I'm not going to comment from here.""

CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS FOUND IN BIDEN’S GARAGE BRING NEW FOCUS ON WH REFUSAL TO RELEASE DELAWARE VISITOR LOGS

""One of the things that we have said for the last two years when it comes to the Department of Justice, when it comes to legal matters, when it comes to legal issues, we have been very clear that we are not going to comment. We are not going to politically interfere,"" she continued. ""I will say that we are consistent with what we have said on cooperating fully with the Department of Justice on this issue, and we will continue to cooperate fully with the special counsel.""

Another reporter asked whether Jean-Pierre knew the additional documents had been found by the time she gave her briefing on Friday, when she was repeatedly asked about the situation.

""So did you not know on Friday that those documents had been found when you were at the podium, or are you being directed by someone to not be forthcoming on this?"" a reporter asked.

""I have been forthcoming from this podium,"" Jean-Pierre responded. ""What I said yesterday was what the statement at the time was–what we all had. You all had the statement, and I was repeating what the counsel was sharing at that time.""

Jean-Pierre was also asked whether the White House’s inconsistencies have damaged her credibility.

"Ketanji Brown Jackson, Biden's Supreme Court pick, refuses to define the word 'woman'","President Biden's Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson refused to define the word ""woman"" on the second day of her confirmation hearings before the U.S. Senate's Judiciary Committee.

Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., pressed Jackson on transgender issues Tuesday night.

""Do you agree that schools should teach children that they can choose their gender?"" Blackburn asked, after she read a quote from Jackson regarding Georgetown Day School, the private school on whose board Brown serves.

BIDEN'S SUPREME COURT PICK KETANJI BROWN JACKSON TESTIFIES FOR SECOND DAY: LIVE UPDATES

Jackson responded by noting that Georgetown Day School is private. When Blackburn pressed again, asking for the judge's opinion, Jackson said, ""Senator, I'm not making comments about what schools can teach.""

Blackburn then turned to quote the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who wrote the majority opinion in U.S. v. Virginia (1996), in which the Court struck down Virginia Military Institute's male-only admissions policy.

""Supposed inherent differences are no longer accepted as a ground for race or national origin classifications,"" Blackburn said, quoting Ginsburg. ""Physical differences, between men and women, however, are enduring. The two sexes are not fungible. A community made up exclusively of one sex is different from a community composed of both.""

""Do you agree with Justice Ginsburg that there are physical differences between men and women that are enduring?"" the senator asked.

TED CRUZ QUESTIONS KETANJI BROWN JACKSON'S ANSWERS ON SEX OFFENDER CASES: ‘DISTURBING PATTERN’

""Um, senator, respectfully I am not familiar with that particular quote or case, so it's hard for me to comment,"" the judge responded.

""Do you interpret Justice Ginsburg's meaning of men and women as male and female?"" Blackburn pressed. Jackson did not comment on the matter.

""Can you provide a definition for the word ‘woman?’"" the senator asked.

""Can I provide a definition? No,"" Jackson responded. ""I can't.""

""You can't?"" Blackburn asked.

""Not in this context, I'm not a biologist,"" the judge replied.

""Do you believe the meaning of the word woman is so unclear and controversial that you can't give me a definition?"" Blackburn pressed.

""Senator, in my work as a judge, what I do is I address disputes. If there's a dispute about a definition, people make arguments, and I look at the law, and I decide,"" Jackson said.

Blackburn argued that ""the fact that you can't give me a straight answer about something as fundamental as what a woman is underscores the dangers of the kind of progressive education that we are hearing about.""

""Just last week, an entire generation of young girls watched as our taxpayer-funded institutions permitted a biological man to compete [against] and beat a biological woman in the NCAA women's swimming championships,"" the senator added, referring to the controversial case of transgender swimmer Lia Thomas.

""What message do you think this sends to girls?""

GOP CANDIDATES STAND WITH WOMEN DEFEATED BY LIA THOMAS, CONDEMNING ‘THE DEATH OF WOMEN’S SPORTS'

""Senator, I'm not sure what message that sends. If you're asking me about the legal issues related to it, those are topics that are being hotly discussed, as you say, and could come to the Court, so I'm not able to"" address them, the judge responded.

Dictionary.com defines ""woman"" as ""an adult female person,"" and classifies the word as an ""Elementary level"" word to define.

Obama administration rejects Keystone pipeline permit,"President Obama announced Wednesday that he will deny a permit for the Keystone XL pipeline, blaming Republicans for imposing a ""rushed and arbitrary deadline"" which he said did not give officials enough time.

GOP lawmakers immediately excoriated the president for the decision. House Speaker John Boehner said Obama is ""selling out American jobs for politics,"" and said Republicans in Congress would continue to push for the pipeline.

The decision does not necessarily kill the project. The State Department said the denial ""does not preclude any subsequent permit application"" -- and within hours pipeline company TransCanada announced that it would reapply for a permit.

But the decision at least delays the project, one that unions and GOP lawmakers alike said would be a boon for job creation as well as energy security.

""Until this pipeline is constructed, the U.S. will continue to import millions of barrels of conflict oil from the Middle East and Venezuela and other foreign countries,"" TransCanada said in a statement Wednesday, saying it is ""disappointed"" by the administration's call. ""Thousands of jobs continue to hang in the balance if this project does not go forward.""

Obama administration officials and congressional Republicans were pointing the finger squarely at each other over the decision.

The White House claimed Republicans' decision to attach a pipeline provision to the short-term payroll tax cut extension last year scuttled the project -- that provision compelled the Obama administration to make a decision on the pipeline in two months.

Obama, in a written statement, said that deadline ""prevented a full assessment of the pipeline's impact.""

""This announcement is not a judgment on the merits of the pipeline, but the arbitrary nature of a deadline that prevented the State Department from gathering the information necessary to approve the project and protect the American people,"" Obama said. ""I'm disappointed that Republicans in Congress forced this decision, but it does not change my administration's commitment to American-made energy that creates jobs and reduces our dependence on oil.""

The State Department made the initial recommendation to Obama on the grounds that there wasn't enough time to review. Obama agreed with that recommendation. According to the White House, Obama called Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper to ""personally convey"" that decision.

But Republicans accused Obama of playing politics and expressed concern that the decision would kill jobs -- 20,000 of them, according to House Republican Leader Eric Cantor.

""The president has showed through his actions that those actions do not match that rhetoric, and by deciding to block the development of the Keystone pipeline, he has essentially decided to block the creation of 20,000 new jobs,"" Cantor said Wednesday.

The decision reverberated on the 2012 campaign trail, as the Republican presidential candidates joined congressional Republicans in blasting the president.

Newt Gingrich called the decision ""stunningly stupid,"" on the grounds that it kills construction jobs and endangers energy security. He also warned that the decision would compel Canada to sell its oil to China.

""What Obama will have done is kill jobs, weaken American energy security, and driven Canada into the hands of China out of sheer, utter stupidity,"" he said.

For three years, the State Department has been reviewing the initial proposal to run a pipeline from Canada down to Texas through a sensitive Nebraska aquifer -- authority it has because of the transnational path the route takes. The pipeline had been through several other federal, state and local approvals, but the department backed away from signing off on the plan last year after environmentalists and local lawmakers complained.

Industry workers and Republicans contend the project would create thousands of jobs, and Canada's prime minister has warned if the U.S. can't get on board, the North American nation will look to team with China.

""Unfortunately Prime Minister Harper of Canada just this week said because of the volatile indecisiveness on the part of this president, that they feel they are being held hostage and they will take their energy elsewhere specifically to Asia and China,"" Jack Gerard, president and CEO of the American Petroleum Institute, told Fox News Radio.

In December, Congress attached to the payroll tax cut a deadline of 60 days for the State Department to determine approval for an alternative route. The language says if Obama rejects the pipeline, Obama must then issue a report to Congress ""that provides a justification for determination, including consideration of economic, employment, energy security, foreign policy, trade and environmental factors.""

On Tuesday, Obama's own jobs council suggested that it agrees with the pipeline concept. While not specifically mentioning Keystone in a report out Tuesday about improving competitiveness, the council said that when it comes to energy projects in general, the government needs to ""expeditiously, though cautiously, move forward on projects that can support hundreds of thousands of jobs.""

""We think this all-in energy strategy can create significant economic growths and significant job creation,"" said Lewis Hay, NextEra Energy CEO and a member of the president's job council.

Obama has noted his environmental concerns when it comes to energy exploration, but insisted Tuesday that a balance could be found.

""I think the recommendations are sound. We see enormous potential in production of traditional fossil fuels,"" he said without mentioning Keystone.

As oil prices rose Wednesday on fresh signs the U.S. economy was improving, which could lead to stronger demand for gasoline and other energy products, the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, argued that the pipeline doesn't make the U.S. any more energy secure just because it would get oil from a close neighbor and friend.

Instead of carrying common crude oil, the Keystone XL pipeline would carry thick, toxic bitumen for refining in the Gulf states, effectively transporting pollution from Canada to the United States,"" reads the NRDC report..

""It is not in the national interest to lock the United States into supporting an expensive and dirty form of oil for many years to come. Also, additional capacity for tar sands oil perpetuates America's addiction to oil, and undermines the clean energy alternatives that would bring genuine energy security,"" the NRDC report continues.

But Gerard said the president's refusal to approve the pipeline is a ""clear abdication of leadership.""

Boehner also accused the president of trying to put off a politically difficult decision until after the election.

""This is not good for our country,"" Boehner said. ""The president wants to put this off until it's convenient for him to make a decision.""

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney blamed Republicans for putting ""in jeopardy"" the entire process.

""In a purely partisan effort to score a political point, Republicans in Congress insisted on inserting an extraneous provision within a bill that had nothing to do with pipelines,"" Carney said, adding that the ""arbitrary deadline"" made an adequate review ""virtually impossible.""",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/obama-administration-rejects-keystone-pipeline-permit,N/A
Stacey Abrams again claims she won Georgia governor’s race: ‘I’m not' a good sport,"Georgia Democrat Stacey Abrams again claimed she won the state's 2018 gubernatorial race on Friday, despite losing to now-Gov. Brian Kemp.

""I'm here to tell you a secret that makes Breitbart and [Fox News host] Tucker Carlson go crazy: We won,” Abrams said, according to The Houston Chronicle. “I am not delusional. I know I am not the governor of Georgia -- possibly yet.""

DEMOCRATS ABRAMS, GILLUM QUESTION OUTCOMES OF 2018 GUBERNATORIAL RACES

She made the remarks an a Houston fundraiser hosted by Annie’s List, a group that seeks to elect progressive women into office. Abrams justified her refusal to accept the result of the election by calling Kemp “an architect of voter suppression that spent the last eight years knitting together a system of voter suppression that is unparalleled in America.”

According to Texas Tribune reporter Patrick Svitek, she said in her remarks that ""we don’t have to concede elections anymore, because when we concede, we are condoning systems that are used to oppress us.""

Abrams has considered both a Senate and presidential run and has been floated as a possible vice presidential candidate. She delivered the formal State of the Union response to President Trump in January.

STACEY ABRAMS WON'T RUN FOR SENATE IN 2020

She announced this week that she will not run for the Senate in 2020 and that she was “going to continue to watch how the national conversation around the presidency unfolds.”

Yet she has repeatedly questioned the outcome of the 2018 race and refused to concede, saying in March, ""I did win my election. I just didn't get to have the job.""

It is unclear if Democratic Party leadership will be put off by her refusal to accept the election result, less than four years after many Democrats expressed horror at then-candidate Donald Trump’s statements that he may not accept the results of the presidential election.

“I will look at it at the time,” Trump said in 2016 when asked in a presidential debate if he would accept the result of the election.

“That’s horrifying,” then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton responded. “This is how Donald thinks, and it's funny but it's also really troubling. This is now how our democracy works.

Abrams on Friday, in video captured by The Texas Signal, indicated that any future run will not be preceded by a concession. She said that usually ""if you want to run for office again you've got to concede the election so that everyone knows that you're a good sport.”

Abrams ran as a Democrat and would have been the first African-American woman governor in America had she won. She lost to Kemp by more than 54,000 votes, but has repeatedly refused to concede the outcome.

""Concession needs to say something is right and true and proper,"" Abrams said, according to the Washington Examiner. ""You can't trick me into saying it was right.""

STACEY ABRAMS SAYS SHE CAN’T DEFEAT BRIAN KEMP IN GEORGIA GOVERNOR RACE; WILL SUE OVER MISMANAGEMENT OF STATE'S ELECTION

During her campaign, Abrams was backed by big-name celebrities and prominent Democrats like Hillary Clinton and former President Barack Obama. The results were mired in controversy because Kemp, who was Georgia’s secretary of state at the time, oversaw the election.

Civil rights groups have accused Kemp of suppressing low-income people and minorities of their voting rights using the state's ""exact match"" law. The law requires election officials to flag any voter registration application if the identifying information doesn't match the voter's information in existing records.

A group backed by Abrams filed a federal lawsuit in January over the alleged voter suppression. Kemp has denied that he disenfranchised voters for his own benefit.

Supreme Court sides with Colorado baker who refused to make wedding cake for same-sex couple,"The Supreme Court ruled Monday in favor of a Colorado baker who refused to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple, in one of the most closely watched cases of the term.

In a 7-2 decision, the justices set aside a Colorado court ruling against the baker -- while stopping short of deciding the broader issue of whether a business can refuse to serve gay and lesbian people. The opinion was penned by Justice Anthony Kennedy, who is often the swing justice in tight cases.

The narrow ruling here focused on what the court described as anti-religious bias on the Colorado Civil Rights Commission when it ruled against baker Jack Phillips.

""The Commission’s hostility was inconsistent with the First Amendment’s guarantee that our laws be applied in a manner that is neutral toward religion,"" Kennedy wrote in his majority opinion.

READ THE DECISION

Attorney Michael Farris, president of the Alliance Defending Freedom which represented the baker, told Fox News that Phillips is “ecstatic” at the decision.

“Justice Kennedy has held that tolerance is a two-way street, and Jack Phillips was not tolerated by the Civil Rights Commission of Colorado,” he said.

The court said the broader issue, though, ""must await further elaboration.""

“The reason and motive for the baker’s refusal were based on his sincere religious beliefs and convictions. The Court’s precedents make clear that the baker, in his capacity as the owner of a business serving the public, might have his right to the free exercise of religion limited by generally applicable laws,"" Kennedy wrote. ""Still, the delicate question of when the free exercise of his religion must yield to an otherwise valid exercise of state power needed to be determined in an adjudication in which religious hostility on the part of the State itself would not be a factor in the balance the State sought to reach.""

At issue was a July 2012 encounter. At the time, Charlie Craig and David Mullins of Denver visited Masterpiece Cakeshop to buy a custom-made wedding cake. Phillips refused his services when told it was for a same-sex couple. The state civil rights commission sanctioned Phillips after a formal complaint from the gay couple.

Mullins has described their case as symbolizing “the rights of gay people to receive equal service in business … about basic access to public life.""

But the Trump administration backed Phillips, who was represented in court by the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian nonprofit. He had lost at every step in the legal appeals process, bringing the case down to the Supreme Court's decision Monday.

""Today’s decision means our fight against discrimination and unfair treatment will continue. We have always believed that in America, you should not be turned away from a business open to the public because of who you are. We brought this case because no one should have to face the shame, embarrassment, and humiliation of being told 'we don’t serve your kind here' that we faced, and we will continue fighting until no one does,"" Craig and Mullins responded Monday.

Phillips has said he lost business and had to let employees go because of the controversy.

And he has maintained that it’s his choice: ""It's not about turning away these customers, it's about doing a cake for an event -- a religious sacred event -- that conflicts with my conscience,"" he said last year.

The court in December specifically examined whether applying Colorado's public accommodations law to compel the local baker to create commercial ""expression"" violated his constitutionally protected Christian beliefs about marriage.

By wading again into the culture wars, the justices had to confront recent decisions on both gay rights and religious liberty: a 2015 landmark opinion legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide and a separate 2014 decision affirming the right of some companies to act on their owner's faith by refusing to provide contraception to its workers.

The Trump administration agreed with Phillips' legal claims to a large extent. Attorney General Jeff Sessions in October issued broad guidance to executive branch agencies, reiterating the government should respect religious freedom, which in the Justice Department's eyes extends to people, businesses and organizations.

But civil rights groups were concerned the conservative majority on the court may be ready to peel back protections for groups with a history of enduring discrimination – and predicted that giving businesses the right to refuse service to certain customers would undermine non-discrimination laws and hurt minorities.

When the justices heard arguments in December, Kennedy was plainly bothered by certain comments by a commission member. The commissioner seemed ""neither tolerant nor respectful of Mr. Phillips' religious beliefs,"" Kennedy said in December.

Liberal justices Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan joined the conservative justices in the outcome. Kagan wrote separately to emphasize the limited ruling.

But Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor dissented.

""I see no reason why the comments of one or two Commissioners should be taken to overcome Phillips’ refusal to sell a wedding cake to Craig and Mullins,"" Ginsburg wrote.

Sarah Warbelow, legal director with the Human Rights Campaign, also stressed that the decision “is so narrow as to apply only to this particular baker.”

Supreme Court takes up religious freedom case involving postal worker who refused to work on Sunday,"The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday agreed to hear a religious liberty case that seeks to make it easier for workers to bring employment discrimination claims when their religious beliefs are not accommodated.

The court will review Groff v. DeJoy, which concerns Gerald Groff, a Christian mailman who says he was wrongfully discriminated against by the U.S. Postal Service after he refused to deliver Amazon packages on Sundays, which he considers to be the Sabbath — a day of worship and rest where work is prohibited.

Groff was employed as an auxiliary mailman in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, from 2012 to 2019. In 2013, USPS contracted with Amazon to deliver packages and workers were required to take Sunday shifts for weekend deliveries.

Initially he was able to work out an arrangement with his supervisors to transfer to another branch that did not deliver on Sundays. When that branch also began Sunday deliveries, Groff was permitted to miss his shifts provided he could find someone to cover for him. However, Groff was frequently unable to do so and missed over two dozen assigned Sunday shifts.

APPEALS COURT RULES AGAINST CHRISTIAN MAIL CARRIER WHO SUED USPS OVER SUNDAY SHIFTS

Believing that he would be fired for missing Sunday shifts, Groff resigned from his job in 2019. He then obtained representation from the conservative First Liberty Institute, Baker Botts LLP, the Church State Council, and the Independence Law Center, and filed a federal lawsuit against the Postal Service.

Groff contends USPS could have accommodated his beliefs by scheduling shifts so that he didn't have to work on Sundays. But the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals held in May 2022 that USPS would suffer an undue hardship if it took further action to accommodate Groff.

CATHOLIC HOSPITAL DISCRIMINATED AGAINST TRANS PATIENT BY REFUSING HYSTERECTOMY, US DISTRICT JUDGE RULES

Federal law generally prohibits employers from firing workers for their religious practices unless an employer can show that their employee's practices cannot ""reasonably"" be accommodated without ""undue hardship."" In its 1977 Trans World Airlines v. Hardison opinion, the Supreme Court said an ""undue hardship"" is imposed on employers whenever the cost of the accommodation is more than a trivial or minimal cost.

The 3rd Circuit decision said USPS had already provided Groff with a reasonable accommodation and that anything more would place an undue hardship on the post office and Groff's co-workers.

MICHIGAN'S MUSLIM-MAJORITY CITY COUNCIL APPROVES ANIMAL SACRIFICE FOR RELIGIOUS PURPOSES

Groff wants the Supreme Court to revisit the ""undue burden"" standard, arguing that it should be easier for employees to bring religious discrimination lawsuits under Title VII.

""No American should be forced to choose between their religion and their job,"" said First Liberty senior counsel Stephanie Taub in an August 2022 statement after filing a petition for the Supreme Court to hear Groff's case. ""We are asking the Court to overturn a poorly-reasoned case from the 1970s that tips the balance in favor of corporations and the government over the religious rights of employees.""

""Observing the Sabbath day is critical to many faiths—a day ordained by God. No one should be forced to violate the Sabbath to hold a job,"" added Randall Wenger of the Independence Law Center.

The case will be heard by a 6-3 majority of Republican appointees on the Supreme Court, who are generally favorable to religious liberty claims.

Supreme Court tosses ruling against bakers who refused cake for gay couple,"The Supreme Court on Monday threw out a ruling against two Oregon bakers who refused to bake a wedding cake for a lesbian couple.

The couple, Melissa and Aaron Klein, cited religious beliefs as their reason for not providing services for a gay wedding. This touched off the latest in a series of such cases making headlines in recent years. During the court's last term, justices ruled in favor of a Colorado baker in a similar situation, stating that a state body demonstrated improper hostility toward the baker's religion in finding that he violated a state anti-discrimination law.

WASHINGTON SUPREME COURT RULES AGAINST FLORIST WHO REFUSED SERVICE FOR GAY COUPLE'S WEDDING

On Monday, the Supreme Court sent the Klein case back down to a lower court ""for further consideration in light of"" their Colorado decision.

The central disputes in the case -- which pits LGBT rights against religious freedom considerations -- have yet to be addressed by the Supreme Court.

A similar case involving Washington state florist Baronelle Stutzman previously was sent back so the state court could review its decision against Stutzman in light of the Colorado case. The Washington court upheld its decision, and the case is expected to go back before the Supreme Court once more.

CHRISTIAN BAKER SUED FOR DISCRIMINATION FOR A THIRD TIME

The Kleins' case arose when Rachel Bowman-Cryer went to them in January 2013 to see about a wedding cake. When Aaron Klein asked for information, including the name of the groom, she told him there was none. Klein then said the bakery does not make cakes for gay weddings, court documents said.

Bowman-Cryer's mother, who was with her, said Klein quoted the Bible when explaining his decision.

The Kleins had to pay a $135,000 judgment to the couple for discriminating against them in violation of a state public accommodations statute. They ended up closing down their bakery.

The couple is represented by First Liberty, who celebrated the Supreme Court's decision as a win.

""This is a victory for Aaron and Melissa Klein and for religious liberty for all Americans,"" First Liberty president Kelly Shackelford said in a statement. ""The Constitution protects speech, popular or not, from condemnation by the government. The message from the Court is clear, government hostility toward religious Americans will not be tolerated.""

Tom Cotton: We shouldn't be ashamed of the Iraq War,"Tom Cotton, the Iraq war veteran from Arkansas turned Republican senator, has a message to fellow soldiers: ""We should not be ashamed of the war we conducted in Iraq.""

Leading Republicans are sticking by the Iraq war, declining to follow the Democrats into full retreat and regret.

Cotton, while conceding that there are lessons to be learned from the conflict and that it might have been handled differently in retrospect, maintains that President George W. Bush made the best decision he could at the time based on the available intelligence about Saddam Hussein's presumed stockpile of weapons of mass destruction.

""Knowing what we know now, I absolutely would have sent the Pacific Fleet out of Pearl Harbor on Dec. 4 to intercept the Japanese Fleet,"" Cotton told the Washington Examiner during an interview in his Capitol Hill office. ""I say that to highlight how foolish the question is. You don't get to live life in reverse. What a leader has to do is make a decision, at the moment of decision, based on the best information he has. George Bush did that in 2002 and 2003 and he was supported by Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden and John Kerry and every western country's intelligence agency.""

"Trump party at presidential debate did not wear masks, refused offer from Cleveland Clinic for face coverings","President Trump's party at the presidential debate on Tuesday refused to wear masks despite a requirement by the venue that they do so, and they turned down a Cleveland Clinic staffer who offered them face coverings.

The refusal by those with Trump, including first lady Melania Trump, to wear masks during the debate was noted at the time. But it has drawn new concern Friday morning after the president, the first lady and top White House adviser Hope Hicks all were revealed to have tested positive for the coronavirus overnight Thursday into Friday. The venue had only made exceptions to its mask rule for Trump, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and moderator Chris Wallace.

""In terms of what went on the hall, it was curious. The Biden camp, Mrs. Biden, Sen. Chris Coons of Deleware, all their people, all came in wearing masks and wore them throughout the entire debate,"" Wallace said Friday. ""The Trump family came in, I'm told, wearing masks but then took them off once they sat down in their seats. That actually violated the rules of the Cleveland Clinic, which was in charge of all the safety issues inside the hall.""

PRESIDENT TRUMP, FIRST LADY TEST POSITIVE FOR CORONAVIRUS, SET TO QUARANTINE AT WHITE HOUSE

Wallace continued: ""A safety person, a health person from the Cleveland Clinic came up to the first family when they were seated and offered them masks in case they didn't have them and they were waved away. And people in the hall noticed that they weren't wearing masks and everybody else in the hall was wearing a mask.

""When the debate ended, Mrs. Trump came over, walked past me and she was not wearing a mask. Mrs. Biden walked past me to her husband and she was wearing a mask, so there was a difference in the way the two families and their camps treated the health-safety regulations inside the hall,"" Wallace said.

Hicks began experiencing coronavirus symptoms on Wednesday evening and tested positive for the virus on Thursday morning. That means the White House knew of her test when Trump traveled to Bedminster, N.J. for a fundraiser on Wednesday. News of Hicks' diagnosis did not break until Thursday night.

Trump as of Friday morning is reportedly experiencing minor symptoms of the coronavirus. The president, though he said that he would wear a mask when he believes he needs one, mocked Biden for wearing masks at campaign events during the Tuesday debate after Wallace noted Trump is holding much larger rallies than Biden.

""I'll put a mask on when I think I need it,"" Trump said. ""I don't wear masks like him. Every time you see him he's got a mask. You could be speaking 200 feet away from [him] and he shows up with the biggest mask I've ever seen.""

""So far we have had no problem whatsoever,"" Trump said after Wallace asked him about holding large rallies with no social distancing. ""It's outside, which is a big deal, according to the experts... We have tremendous crowds as you see and literally on 24 hours notice, and Joe does the circles and has three people someplace.""

Biden shot back that Trump has been ""totally irresponsible"" on social distancing in his rallies and ""a fool.""

Trump replied: ""If you could get the crowds you would've done the same thing.""",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-party-debate-coronavirus-masks,N/A
VP Harris dodges question about migrant children: 'I haven't been briefed on anything today about it',"Vice President Harris dodged a question about the migrant crisis at the southern border and how it's affecting unaccompanied children on Tuesday.

""I haven’t been briefed on anything today about it yet, but I will when I get on the plane,"" Harris told reporters before boarding a plane to leave Colorado, where she took part in a small business roundtable earlier in the day.

BIDEN ADMIN CAN'T KEEP UP WITH BORDER SURGE OF MIGRANT CHILDREN, CBP OFFICIAL WARNS

Harris' response comes as the Biden administration has refused to call the perilous border situation a crisis.

""We certainly also recognize because the president and our administration has made a decision that the way to humanely approach immigration is to allow for unaccompanied children to come and be treated with humanity and be in a safe place while we’re ... trying to get them into homes and sponsors homes,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said last week.

Psaki spoke a day after Customs and Border Protection announced that the agency encountered 100,441 individuals in February, a 28% increase over January, the agency said. Of those, 19,246 individuals were in family units, 9,457 were unaccompanied children (UACs) and 71,598 were single adults.

THE WORD THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION WON'T USE WHEN IT COMES TO THE BORDER? 'CRISIS'

Migrant children are arriving at the U.S. southern border at rates faster than they can be processed and transferred to sponsor homes, all while the Biden administration has repeatedly denied that there is a ""crisis"" at the border, a senior Customs and Border Protection official told Fox News.

Washington Supreme Court rules against florist who refused service for gay couple's wedding,"In a hotly anticipated decision, the Washington Supreme Court ruled against a florist who was fined for not providing services for a gay couple's wedding.

The court had previously heard the case, State of Washington v. Arlene's Flowers, ruling that Barronelle Stutzman and her store, Arlene's Flowers, violated the Washington Law Against Discrimination (WLAD) for refusing to make floral arrangements for a gay couple in 2013. Stutzman claimed that she was only acting in accordance with her religious beliefs. The U.S. Supreme Court asked the state high court to take another look at whether it violated her religious rights by not being neutral to her religion when making its decision.

HUNDREDS SUPPORT CHRISTIAN FLORIST FINED FOR REFUSING TO WORK GAY WEDDING

That court said no.

""We now hold that the answer to the Supreme Court's question is no; the adjudicatory bodies that considered this case did not act with religious animus when they ruled that the florist and her corporation violated the Washington Law Against Discrimination ... by declining to sell wedding flowers to a gay couple,"" the Washington Supreme Court's ruling said, ""and they did not act with religious animus when they ruled that such discrimination is not privileged or excused by the United States Constitution or the Washington Constitution.""

The U.S. Supreme Court held off on reviewing the case so that the state court could take another look in light of the 2018 SCOTUS decision in Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission. That case drew national attention, as it pitted the First Amendment against LGBT rights.

The high court declined to get involved in that battle, however, ruling in favor of the baker by stating that the Colorado commission was improperly hostile to his religious beliefs when they found him in violation of a state law. The U.S. Supreme Court asked the Washington Supreme Court to make sure they did not make the same mistake.

In the new decision, the Washington Supreme Court defended its initial ruling, stating that the state's public accommodation law prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation and that Stutzman discriminated against Robert Ingersoll because he was marrying a man.

The new ruling says that the court ""painstakingly reviewed the record for any sign of intolerance on behalf of this court or the Benton County Superior Court, the two adjudicatory bodies to consider this case,"" and that ""we are confident that the two courts gave full and fair consideration to this dispute and avoided animus toward religion.""

Stutzman's case involves similar facts to the Masterpiece Cakeshop case, which involved baker Jack Phillips. Phillips claimed that he had no problem selling to gay customers in general, he just would not bake a cake for a gay wedding. Stutzman's case involved a gay couple, Ingersoll and Curt Freed, who had already been customers of hers. According to court documents, Ingersoll had gone to her for nine years, and Stutzman knew he was gay and in a relationship with Freed.

COLORADO'S SECOND CASE AGAINST MASTERPIECE CAKESHOP AND JACK PHILLIPS CRUMBLES

Another issue in the case is whether the creation of a floral arrangement is artistic expression protected by the First Amendment's free speech clause. Stutzman claimed that she would have sold Ingersoll and Freed ""raw materials"" and bulk flowers for their wedding, but she would not create a custom arrangement. Similarly, Phillips had claimed that while he would not create a cake for a gay wedding, he would sell a premade one.

With the U.S. Supreme Court declining to settle the free speech and religious freedom issues in Phillips' case, they have the opportunity to do so again, should they decide to review Stutzman's.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/washington-supreme-court-rules-against-florist-who-refused-service-for-gay-couples-wedding,N/A
AP drops NFL MVP voter who refused to vote for Aaron Rodgers due to vaccine status: report,"The Associated Press has let go the NFL MVP voter who refused to cast his ballot for Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers last season due in part to the veteran signal caller refusing the COVID-19 vaccine, OutKick says.

""Has he been the most valuable on the field? Yeah, you could make that argument.

Randy Moss jokes about why he refused to go to Tennessee to play college football,"Randy Moss was a highly sought-after college football recruit before he became a Heisman Trophy finalist and a Fred Biletnikoff Award winner.

Moss’ dream was to go to Notre Dame and signed a letter of intent to play for the Fighting Irish in 1995. However, a fight he was involved in led to Notre Dame denying his enrollment application, and he would eventually make his way to Marshall, where he would star for the Thundering Herd.

On Monday, Moss appeared on the ""ManningCast"" and talked about Tennessee’s recruitment of Moss before he planned on playing for Notre Dame. Peyton Manning, who was a budding star quarterback at the time, was meant to convince Moss to join the Volunteers, but things hit a snag.

""What was crazy was that my initial visit to Tennessee wasn’t as crazy because … my first visit to Notre Dame was special because that’s where my heart was,"" Moss explained. ""So, when I went to Tennessee, all I heard was ‘Peyton Manning’s in Virginia at a family member’s house.

Custard Customer Won't Return Finger,"To a dessert shop customer, the severed fingertip found in a pint of frozen custard could be worth big dollars in a potential lawsuit. To the shop worker who lost it, the value is far more than monetary.

But Clarence Stowers (search) still has the digit, refusing to return the evidence so it could be reattached. And now it's too late for doctors to do anything for 23-year-old Brandon Fizer (search).

""I'm not saying who has it, but somebody has it,"" Stowers said this week in a telephone interview, refusing to let on where the fingertip is now.

Soon after Stowers found the finger in a mouthful of chocolate soft-serve he bought Sunday at Kohl's (search) Frozen Custard in Wilmington, he put it in his freezer at home, taking it out only occasionally to show to television cameras.

He refused to give it to the shop's owner and refused to give it to a doctor. Fizer accidentally stuck his hand in a mixing machine and had his right index finger lopped off at the first knuckle.

Medical experts say an attempt to reattach a severed finger can generally be made within six hours.

But according to the shop's management, Stowers wouldn't give it back when he was in the store 30 minutes after the accident.

""The general manager attempted to retrieve it and rush it to the hospital,"" reads a statement posted Thursday on Kohl's Web site. ""Unfortunately, the customer refused to give it to her and declared that he would be calling the TV stations and an attorney as he exited the store.""

Officials at Cape Fear Hospital said their efforts to retrieve the finger also failed.

Dr. James Larson, director of emergency medicine for UNC Hospitals, who was not involved in the case, said once Stowers took the finger home and froze it, it was too late to even try for reattachment.

""You can't freeze it. It kills the cells,"" Larson said.

The doctor said the best way to preserve a severed limb is to wrap it in saline-soaked gauze, place it in a plastic bag and store that in ice water.

Stowers' attorney, Lee Andrews of Greensboro, wouldn't say if a lawsuit against Kohl's is planned, saying he needed ""to get some more facts.""

But Andrews said his client is concerned about possible disease in the fingertip and kept it because he wanted someone to test it for ""all the diseases that are out here now.""

""He's upset to the point that he's been debilitated to some degree,"" Andrews said. ""Emotionally, it's been very upsetting to him.""

Even if Stowers decides to sue, an expert in medical law said the fingertip could easily have been returned while preserving the evidence.

""The man who lost the finger has the superior claim,"" said Paul Lombardo, who teaches at the University of Virginia's law school. ""It's his finger and he might be able to use it.""

Lombardo said Stowers could have photographed the fingertip, taken a bit of flesh for DNA analysis or gotten an affidavit from the surgeon who would have reattached the digit.

""There is nothing that would prevent preserving the chain of evidence,"" Lombardo said.

Fizer is dealing with his loss in private. The Carolina Beach resident's mother, Sheri Fizer, said the family had been instructed by an attorney not to talk about the case.

Public opinion seemed to be running against Stowers.

""It's a mystery how that customer can live with himself after he refused to return the finger so that doctors might try to reattach it,"" said an editorial Thursday by the Star-News of Wilmington.

""Unless he offers a better explanation for that decision, people will assume that customer Clarence Stowers cared less about another person's loss of a body part than about his chance to squeeze some bucks out of the custard stand.""

The case came not long after a Las Vegas woman made headlines with a claim that she found a finger tip in a bowl of chili at a Wendy's restaurant in San Jose, Calif. Investigators have called her claim a hoax and charged her in connection with millions of dollars in losses to Wendy's in northern California. The woman denies it was a hoax.

For Kohl's, Sunday's fingertip amputation was the second time in less than a year that a worker lost a finger on the same frozen custard machine. The worker was found by investigators to have been negligent in the July 2004 incident, and the state Labor Department cleared the company of wrongdoing.",https://www.foxnews.com/story/custard-customer-wont-return-finger,N/A
"American Airlines flight diverted after passenger refused to stop doing pull-ups on plane, man claims","One man’s mile-high workout took an unexpected turn.

An American Airlines flight from Phoenix to Boston was diverted to Kansas City, Mo., Monday evening after a passenger allegedly refused to stop doing pull-ups using the plane’s overhead bins.

According to other passengers on Flight 2763, the unidentified man appeared to be intoxicated when he boarded the plane with a woman and two dogs. Soon after the man began bizarrely demonstrating his athleticism.

“He was leaning up against where you put the bags overhead and a passenger came by and said ‘What are you going to do, some pull-ups?’ and the guy actually grabbed on to it and started doing some pull ups on the plane in front of everybody,” passenger David Markoski told WBZ.

Markoski told reporters the man ordered alcohol on the flight and became more belligerent.

“He would not sit down. The flight attendant probably asked him about three or four times to sit down and he refused to sit down and then he really got verbally abusive with her, starting calling her names,” Markoski said.

The plane carrying 147 passengers and six crew members was forced to divert to Kansas City because of the unruly passenger, American Airlines confirmed to Fox News.

“PHX-BOS diverted to MCI due to an unruly passenger last night. Passenger was removed by law enforcement, and flight re-departed,” the statement read.

"Air Force cadets who refused COVID vaccine will graduate, but won't receive commissions","Three Air Force Academy cadets who the force initially said would not be allowed to graduate over their refusal to get vaccinated against the coronavirus will receive their degrees this month, but they will not receive commissions.

The Academy's board conducted a ""standard review"" and recommended that the three seniors receive Bachelor of Science degrees, according to a press release from the school.

But the Academy also said they ""will not be commissioned into the United States Air Force as long as they remain unvaccinated"" and that Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall will determine if the graduates will be required to ""reimburse the United States for education costs in lieu of service.""

And while the graduates will be awarded their degrees, they will not be permitted to attend the May 25 graduation ceremony.

AIR FORCE CADETS MAY NOT GRADUATE AFTER REFUSING COVID VACCINE

""That has been confirmed and is petty, vindictive, disrespectful and unnecessary,"" attorney Mike Rose, who represents one of the unvaccinated cadets, told The Washington Times.

This comes after Air Force officials said earlier this month that four cadets may not graduate or be commissioned as military officers, and that they could be forced to pay back thousands in tuition. The fourth graduate opted to get vaccinated, and will now graduate and become an Air Force officer.

The Pentagon announced last year a vaccine mandate for service members, including for those at military academies.

AIR FORCE CADETS FACE EXPULSION OVER VACCINE MANDATE

""To defend this Nation, we need a healthy and ready force,"" Defense Secretary Loyd Austin wrote in an August memo . ""After careful consultation with medical experts and military leadership, and with the support of the President, I have determined that mandatory vaccination against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is necessary to protect the Force and defend the American people.""

The fairness of the military's vaccine exemption reviews have been questioned by members of Congress, the military and the public, and multiple lawsuits have been filed over opposition to the mandate, centered primarily on the fact that very few religious exemptions had been granted.

The Marine Corps, Navy, Army and Air Force have discharged nearly 4,000 active duty service members over their refusal to get vaccinated. Recent data from the services shows that more than 2,100 Marines, 900 sailors, 500 Army soldiers and 360 airmen have been discharged. At least 50 service members were discharged during entry-level training.

CDC RECOMMENDS PFIZER BOOSTER SHOT FOR CHILDREN 5 TO 11

Service members who have refused the vaccine without seeking an exemption are still being discharged while the discharges of those involved in lawsuits are held up amid the legal battles.

The military has said that as many as 20,000 service members have requested a religious exemption and that thousands of such applications have been denied.

California court rules in favor of Christian baker who refused to bake cake for lesbian wedding,"A California court ruled in favor of a Christian baker Friday following a years-long legal battle after she refused to bake a custom cake for a lesbian wedding in 2017, citing her religious beliefs.

""We applaud the court for this decision,"" Thomas More Society special counsel Charles LiMandri said in a statement. ""The freedom to practice one’s religion is enshrined in the First Amendment, and the United States Supreme Court has long upheld the freedom of artistic expression.""

Cathy Miller, a cake designer who owns the popular Tastries bakery in Bakersfield, California, won what her lawyers at the Thomas More Society called ""a First Amendment victory"" when Judge Eric Bradshaw of the Superior Court of California in Kern County ruled against California's Department of Fair Housing and Employment, which had brought the lawsuit against her.

Miller was subject to multiple lawsuits after she referred a lesbian couple to another baker when they requested a cake for their wedding. Because of her Christian belief that marriage is between one man and one woman, Miller declined to design a custom cake for their ceremony, believing it would be tantamount to a tacit affirmation.

CALIFORNIA BAKERY FACING BACKLASH AFTER REFUSING TO MAKE WEDDING CAKES FOR SAME-SEX COUPLES

In an interview with KERO in 2017, Miller said, ""Here at Tastries, we love everyone. My husband and I are Christians, and we know that God created everyone, and He created everyone equal, so it's not that we don't like people of certain groups, there is just certain things that violate my conscience.""

California's Department of Fair Housing and Employment subsequently filed legal action against Miller's business under the Unruh Civil Rights Act, an expansive 1959 state law aimed at protecting consumers from discrimination by businesses on the basis of race, ethnicity or religion.

Paul Jonna, Thomas More Society special counsel who also served as one of Miller's lawyers, noted in a statement that there was ""a certain irony"" in his client's case given ""that a law intended to protect individuals from religious discrimination was used to discriminate against Cathy for her religious beliefs.""

CHRISTIAN BAKERS PETITION SUPREME COURT AGAIN TO OVERTURN PENALTY FOR REFUSING TO BAKE SAME-SEX WEDDING CAKE

Noting that Miller's beliefs regarding marriage are mainstream Christian teachings, Jonna alleged that attorneys for the state harassed his client.

The Thomas More Society claimed in a press release that during her deposition in February, lawyers for the state apparently questioned the sincerity of Miller's faith by quizzing her regarding whether she adhered to the dietary laws of the Old Testament like she does the Bible's teachings on sexual morality.

""The state was actually questioning the sincerity of Cathy’s faith,"" Jonna said. ""The fact that they called Miller’s open and sincerely held beliefs into question is almost as disturbing as quibbling over her status as an artist.""

During closing arguments before the judge in July, LiMandri said that Miller would have provided the couple with a pre-made cake but that she regarded one made with her personal artistry as an endorsement of gay marriage, which goes against her Christian beliefs.",https://www.foxnews.com/us/california-court-rules-favor-christian-baker-refused-bake-cake-lesbian-wedding,N/A
Christian childcare teacher who refused to read LGBT books to kids sues after being fired: 'Blatantly illegal',"A California childcare teacher sued her former employer last week after she was allegedly terminated and mistreated because of her religious objection to reading books to children featuring same-sex couples.

Nelli Parisenkova, who is being represented by lawyers with the Thomas More Society, worked four years at Bright Horizons Children's Center in Studio City and cared for children aged five and younger, according to the complaint she filed Thursday in the Superior Court of California.

The lawsuit claims Parisenkova was aware of such LGBT-themed material at the Studio City location of the largest childcare company in the U.S., but at first had not been required to read them. Founded in 1986, Bright Horizons has hundreds of locations worldwide and employs more than 26,000 people.

Parisenkova's situation changed in April when Katy Callas, who serves as director of the location, learned of Parisenkova’s religious objections to the material, refused her request for a religious accommodation and ultimately created a hostile work environment that led to her termination, according to the complaint.

MICHIGAN HEALTH TERMINATED PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT FOR RELIGIOUS BELIEFS, LAWYER SAYS: ‘SERIOUS INJUSTICE’

The complaint explained how for Parisenkova, who is ""a devout Christian,"" reading such books to children ""would violate her religious beliefs and constitute promotion of intimate relationships and choices that are contrary to the teachings of her faith.""

""Parisenkova formally requested a religious accommodation from Bright Horizons that aligned with her prior informally granted request. Bright Horizons responded by categorically denying the request,"" the suit said, which goes on to claim Bright Horizons ""made no attempt whatsoever to determine whether a reasonable accommodation could be reached.""

""Instead, Bright Horizons issued a counseling memo with false statements, terminated her life insurance benefits, required her to complete retraining in diversity issues, and encouraged her to resign her position,"" the suit alleged. ""Ms. Parisenkova could not return to work without an accommodation; so, Bright Horizons terminated her employment.""

The suit slaps Bright Horizons and its staff with several charges, including unlawful retaliation, failure to prevent discrimination and harassment, religion-based harassment, wrongful termination, failure to accommodate, unlawful constructive discharge and disparate treatment.

TEXAS LAWMAKER ON ARMED ANTIFA MEMBERS SHOWING UP AT ‘KID-FRIENDLY’ DRAG SHOW: ‘THEY WANT TO INTIMIDATE’

Bright Horizons has been outspoken in its support for LGBT community, documenting in October 2018 how its centers celebrated LGBT History Month by participating in Pride parades and reading LGBT-themed books to children. In 2019, the organization also endorsed the Equality Act, which would add sexual orientation and gender identity to federal antidiscrimination policy.

Paul Jonna, special counsel at the Thomas More Society and one of Parisenovka's attorneys, described her case in a statement as ""an outrageous example of religious discrimination.""

Jonna said Parisenovka ""had been operating under the radar with an informal accommodation request for multiple years without notice,"" but that ""as soon as upper-level management discovered her religious beliefs and received her formal accommodation request,"" Bright Horizons leveled against her ""the full force of the company’s anti-religious and ironically ‘un-inclusive’ diversity policy.""

""They tried to get her to quit through harassment and intimidation. When she couldn’t return to work because they denied her accommodation request, they fired her,"" Jonna added. ""You can’t get much more discriminatory than that. It’s unethical, and it’s blatantly illegal.""

Jonna also claimed that when his client was called into Callas' office, the director ""questioned her in an irate manner, told her that if she did not want to celebrate diversity this was not the place for her to work, gave her an administrative leave memo, escorted her outside with a security guard, and left her out in the 96-degree heat with no transportation.""

Parisenovka reportedly had to walk 20 minutes in the scorching weather, waiting 45 minutes for transportation and suffering from heat exhaustion for the next two days.

Colorado baker who refused to make same-sex wedding cake challenged over 'gender transition cake',"The Colorado baker who won a partial Supreme Court victory after refusing on religious grounds to make a gay couple's wedding cake a decade ago is challenging a separate ruling he violated the state's anti-discrimination law by refusing to make a cake celebrating a gender transition.

A lawyer for Jack Phillips on Wednesday urged Colorado's appeals court — largely on procedural grounds — to overturn last year's ruling in a lawsuit brought by a transgender woman.

The woman, Autumn Scardina, called Phillips' suburban Denver cake shop in 2017 requesting a birthday cake that had blue frosting on the outside and was pink inside to celebrate her gender transition. At trial last year, Phillips, a Christian, testified he did not think someone could change genders and he would not celebrate ""somebody who thinks that they can.""

ILLINOIS HIGH SCHOOL LIBRARIAN PROMOTES CONTROVERSIAL GRAPHIC NOVEL 'GENDER QUEER' ON TIKTOK

Jake Warner, an attorney representing Phillips from the conservative Christian legal advocacy group Alliance Defending Freedom, said the ruling was wrong. He said requiring Phillips to create a cake with a message contrary to his religious beliefs amounts to forcing him to say something he does not believe, violating his right to free speech.

Judge Timothy Schutz noted Phillips' wife initially told Scardina the bakery could make the cake before Scardina volunteered that the design was meant to celebrate her gender transition.

One of Scardina's lawyers, John McHugh, said Scardina did not ask the shop to endorse her idea, just sell her a cake that they would sell anyone else. He said whether or not Phillips sells a cake to someone cannot depend on what the client tells him when he is making the cake.

Both Scardina and Phillips spoke outside the court of larger issues involved. Scardina said the case was about the ""dignity of LGBTQ Americans and Coloradans and the rule of law."" Phillips said he was fighting for the rights of all Americans to live according to their consciences ""without fear of punishment"" by government.

In 2018, the Supreme Court ruled that the Colorado Civil Rights Commission had acted with anti-religious bias in enforcing the anti-discrimination law against Phillips after he refused to bake a cake celebrating the wedding of Charlie Craig and Dave Mullins in 2012. The justices called the commission unfairly dismissive of Phillips’ religious beliefs.

BIDEN ADMINISTRATION WANTS FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO BE DIVERSITY, EQUITY MODEL FOR THE NATION

The high court did not rule then on the larger issue of whether a business can invoke religious objections to refuse service to LGBTQ people. But it will get another chance when it hears a different case in coming months challenging Colorado's anti-discrimination law.

The case involves Denver-area designer Lorie Smith, who wants to offer wedding website services but says her Christian beliefs would lead her to decline any request from a same-sex couple to design a wedding website. She also wants to post a statement on her website about her beliefs but says Colorado's law violates her free speech and religious rights.

In agreeing to take the case, the Supreme Court said it would only examine the free speech issue.

Smith is also defended by Alliance Defending Freedom. Phillips' lawyers unsuccessfully asked Colorado's appeals court to delay hearing arguments in his challenge until after the Supreme Court rules in Smith's case.

VICE CHAIR OF TREASURY DEPT'S NEW RACIAL EQUITY COMMITTEE WANTS TO DEFUND THE POLICE, ‘CENTER RACE’ IN ALL POLICY

Scardina, an attorney, attempted to order her cake on the same day in 2017 that the Supreme Court announced it would hear Phillips’ appeal in the wedding cake case. Scardina testified she wanted to ""challenge the veracity"" of Phillips statements that he would serve LGBT customers.

Before filing suit, Scardina first filed a complaint against Phillips with the state and the civil rights commission, which found probable cause that Phillips had discriminated against her. Phillips then filed a federal lawsuit against Colorado, accusing it of a ""crusade to crush"" him by pursuing the complaint.

In March 2019, lawyers for the state and Phillips agreed to drop both cases under a settlement Scardina was not involved in. Warner told the appeals court panel that Scardina was required to appeal to the state appeals court first before filing a lawsuit and — since she did not — the ruling against Phillips should be thrown out because the state court judge who heard the lawsuit did not have jurisdiction.

McHugh argued the settlement did not reach a conclusion on Scardina's discrimination claim so there was nothing to stop her from filing a lawsuit against Phillips to pursue it.

After trial of the lawsuit last year, Denver District Judge A. Bruce Jones rejected Phillips’ argument that making the cake would constitute compelled speech, saying it was simply a product sold by a business that couldn't be withheld from people who have traditionally been treated unfairly and are protected by the state’s anti-discrimination law. He said Phillips’ decision not to provide the requested cake was ""inextricably intertwined"" with his refusal to recognize Scardina as a woman.",https://www.foxnews.com/us/co-baker-won-case-refusing-make-gay-wedding-cake-challenged-again-gender-transition-cake,N/A
Treasure hunter who refused to disclose location of shipwreck’s 500 coins marks 6th year in jail,"A former deep-sea treasure hunter is preparing to mark his sixth year in jail for refusing to disclose the whereabouts of 500 missing coins made from gold found in an historic shipwreck.

Research scientist Tommy Thompson has been held in contempt of court since Dec. 15, 2015, for that refusal. He is also incurring a daily fine of $1,000.

Thompson's case dates to his discovery of the S.S. Central America, known as the Ship of Gold, in 1988. The gold rush-era ship sank in a hurricane off South Carolina in 1857 with thousands of pounds of gold aboard, contributing to an economic panic.

Despite an investors lawsuit and a federal court order, Thompson, 69, still won't cooperate with authorities trying to find those coins, according to court records, federal prosecutors and the judge who found Thompson in contempt.

Thompson says he’s already said everything he knows about the coins. Thompson pleaded guilty in April 2015 for his failure to appear for a 2012 hearing and was sentenced to two years in prison and a $250,000 fine. But Thompson’s criminal sentence has been delayed until the issue of the gold coins is resolved.

Ex-Virginia Tech soccer player allegedly benched for refusing to kneel gets $100K settlement: attorney,"A former Virginia Tech women's soccer player who accused her coach of benching her because of her political opinions will reportedly receive at least $100,000 as part of an agreement to dismiss a federal lawsuit.

Kiersten Hening will receive the award as part of a settlement in the lawsuit she filed in 2021 against head coach Charles ""Chugger"" Adair on First Amendment grounds, her attorney Cameron Norris said last week, according to the Roanoke Times.

Norris noted the terms of the settlement did not include an admission of wrongdoing by either his client or Adair.

There are no details of the settlement in court records, according to the outlet, but Norris said the agreement has to be approved by university and state officials before it becomes final.

EX-VIRGINIA TECH SOCCER PLAYER ALLEGEDLY BENCHED FOR REFUSING TO KNEEL ALLOWED TO PROCEED WITH LAWSUIT: JUDGE

Hening, who was a midfielder/defender for the Hokies from 2018 to 2020, sued Adair in his personal and official capacity as coach, alleging he punished her for her political views, which often differed from her teammates during the height of the Black Lives Matter movement in 2020.

BLACK LIVES MATTER HAS NEARLY $42 MILLION IN ASSETS: IRS DOCUMENTS

Hening claimed she was removed from her starting position and pressured to leave the team after she declined to kneel during a reading of a ""unity statement"" before a game against UVA on Sept. 12, 2020. She said Adair ""verbally attacked her"" at halftime, claiming she was ""b--tching and moaning"" while putting his finger in her face.

Hening explained in the lawsuit that while she ""supports social justice and believes that black lives matter,"" she ""does not support BLM the organization,"" citing its ""tactics and core tenets of its mission statement, including defunding the police.""

Adair continued to berate Hening until he benched her and ultimately made things so intolerable that she felt she had no choice but to quit the team, according to the suit.

On Dec. 2, federal Judge Thomas Cullen denied a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, noting that Hening's time on the field dropped off following the kneeling incident. Adair had argued that two other players who declined to kneel did not face reduced playing time.

""Ultimately, Adair may convince a jury that this coaching decision was based solely on Hening’s poor play during the UVA game, but the court, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Hening, cannot reach that conclusion as a matter of law,"" ruled Cullen, who said the issues in the case are fundamental.

The three-day trial slated to start later this month was canceled last Tuesday in a court filing that noted the case had been settled.

On Jan. 4, Adair released a statement on Twitter, saying in part, ""I am pleased the case against me has been closed and I am free to move forward clear of any wrong doing.""

""It’s unfortunate, but this ordeal was about a disappointment and disagreement about playing time. Today, we have clarity that this case lacked any standing, and without evidence, the truth has prevailed,"" said Adair, who made no mention of the settlement.

Attorney Adam Mortara tweeted in reply to Adair's statement: ""If by clarity you mean you are paying my client six figures in a settlement then you’re right that’s pretty clear. Honestly, Coach, read the Court’s opinion. You are paying. Defendants don’t pay in cases that have no standing.""

Hening alleged that Adair was not a fan of her political views and that she often differed from her teammates on social justice issues during the height of the Black Lives Matter movement in 2020.

The coach continued to berate Hening until he benched her and ultimately made things so intolerable that she felt compelled to quit the team, according to the suit.

""Hening, who had been a major on-field contributor for two years prior to the 2020 season, also asserts that Adair removed her from the starting lineup for the next two games and drastically reduced her playing time in those games because she had engaged in this protected First Amendment activity.

Adair, who argued that two other players who declined to kneel did not face reduced playing time, moved to dismiss the lawsuit, which was denied.

Minnesota jury sides with pharmacist who refused to fill contraception prescription due to religious views,"A Minnesota pharmacist did not violate the rights of a female customer by refusing to give her emergency contraceptives, a jury decided Friday.

George Badeaux faced a lawsuit that went to trial last week after Andrea Anderson sued him under Minnesota’s Human Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination based on sex, pregnancy or childbirth. Badeaux claimed that he would not provide Anderson with contraceptives due to his religious beliefs.

Gender Justice, an organization that represented Anderson in the case, told Minnesota Public Radio News that they will appeal the decision.

""To be clear, the law in Minnesota prohibits sex discrimination and that includes refusing to fill prescriptions for emergency contraception,"" said Gender Justice Legal Director Jess Braverman said in a statement. ""The jury was not deciding what the law is, they were deciding the facts of what happened here in this particular case. We will appeal this decision and won’t stop fighting until Minnesotans can get the health care they need without the interference of providers putting their own personal beliefs ahead of their legal and ethical obligations to their patients.""

MN PHARMACIST SUED FOR REFUSING TO FILL PRESCRIPTION FOR EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION BECAUSE OF RELIGIOUS BELIEFS

Anderson filed her claim after she went to the Thrifty White pharmacy in McGregor, Minn., in January 2019 with a prescription for a morning-after pill. After Badeaux said he would not fill the prescription due to his beliefs, she called other pharmacies that also said they could not fill it. She eventually traveled more than 100 miles round-trip so she could get her prescription filled at a pharmacy that would accommodate her, the complaint said, noting that this took ""over three hours"" due to a winter storm.

BIPARTISAN GROUP OF SENATORS INTRODUCES BILL FOR FEDERAL PROTECTION OF ABORTION RIGHTS, CONTRACEPTION

Anderson’s complaint noted that the Minnesota Board of Pharmacy allows pharmacists to decline filling prescriptions for emergency contraception, but requires them to give the customer information for an alternative way to have it filled. Anderson alleged that Badeaux told her that another pharmacy employee would be in the next day, but that he could not guarantee that this person would help her or even show up due to the weather. Rather than tell her where she could go to get the prescription filled, Anderson claimed, Badeaux told her which pharmacies would not help her.

Aitkin County District Judge David Hermerding said Badeaux could not raise federal constitutional issues such as freedom of religion in his defense, because the case was brought filed under the state's Human Rights Act.

""The issue for the jury is not defendant’s constitutional rights,"" the judge wrote. ""It is whether he deliberately misled, obfuscated and blocked Ms. Anderson’s path to obtaining"" emergency contraception.

The judge said Badeaux was allowed to explain his religious beliefs to the jury, the judge ruled, ""but not in such a manner as to confuse the jury into thinking this is a religious freedom contest.""

While the jury sided with Badeaux on this issue, they did award Anderson $25,000 for emotional harm.

NY high school student spent hours out in the cold after she refused to wear a mask,"A 16-year-old high school student sat in a cold vestibule for hours because her New York high school wouldn't allow her in the building without a mask, even though the state's mask mandate had been struck down as unconstitutional the day before. While the police department said the girl remained in the school's vestibule for a kind of sit-in protest, the girl's father claimed the school mistreated her by refusing to give her food, water, or access to a bathroom.

""She was getting treated definitely worse than a prisoner,"" Vincent Igoe, the girl's father, told Fox News Digital on Sunday. ""Even inmates in jail get offered food and water.""

NEW YORK JUDGE STRIKES DOWN HOCHUL'S MASK MANDATE, GOVERNOR VOWS FIGHT

Igoe shared footage with Fox News of his encounters with his daughter, the school resource officer, his ex-wife, and an associate principal at South Colonie Central High School outside Albany, New York, on Tuesday, Jan. 25. He claimed that the videos showed that the school exiled his daughter from class unlawfully.

The South Colonie Central School District superintendent disputed Igoe's version of events but declined to explain why he considered the father's claims ""false and misleading."" The Colonie Police Department said that the girl's presence in the vestibule was a kind of protest, that the school had merely followed its policy, and that the school resource officer did nothing wrong.

Igoe recounted that on Monday, Jan. 24, he and his daughter were watching the news, and they heard that a New York Supreme Court judge struck down the state's mask mandate as ""unconstitutional."" ""She said, ‘I’m not wearing my mask tomorrow,'"" Igoe recalled. Even though an appeals court judge temporarily reinstated the mandate on Tuesday afternoon, Igoe's daughter's actions took place while the mandate was no longer in effect.

Indeed, Igoe gave Fox News Digital an email that Superintendent David Perry had sent to school officials, urging them to uphold the mandate despite the court ruling.

""Please see attached court document regarding NYS Supreme Court Justice Thomas Rademaker's ruling today, January 24, 2022, that the Governor's mask mandate for students is illegal,"" Perry wrote. ""This will undoubtedly get appealed as there are several court levels higher than this judge. We will stay the course with mask usage in South Colonie until further notice.""

PARENTS RIGHTS ACTIVISTS SLAM ACLU FOR OPPOSING CURRICULUM TRANSPARENCY LAWS AMID CRT BATTLES

Igoe recounted the events of Tuesday, Jan. 25.

""She was stopped in the hallway, and then she was dragged,"" he recounted. ""The administrators told her to put a mask on, she said she’s not putting a mask on, it’s illegal. Then a school resource officer grabbed her by her arm, and dragged her through the hallway into the cold vestibule of the school.""

Igoe said he arrived at the school around 7:50 a.m. He confronted the school resource officer and an associate principal. ""If you’re not going to let her in school, I said please provide me suspension documents or something in writing saying why you are not letting her in school,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""All I’m asking for is this document, something in writing saying why they want her to leave.""

""I stayed in that vestibule with my daughter until the police department threatened to arrest me,"" he said. He left and returned hours later.

""They kept her in that vestibule all day long, with no food, no water, and no bathroom,"" he said.

Igoe said the school initially refused to let his daughter use the restroom, but later relented. ""They walked her outside in 15-degree weather, no jacket,"" to use the bathroom ""in an unused part of the school, unused and unheated part of the school.""

The father also claimed that the school resource officer used force against his daughter, yet none of his footage shows the officer dragging his daughter by the arm.

Bob Winn, deputy chief at the Colonie Police Department, disputed parts of Igoe's account and defended the school resource officer's actions.

""The officer was trying to assist the mother of the child with getting her out of the school,"" Winn told Fox News Digital on Sunday. He said that footage from inside the school exonerated the officer from Igoe's claims. ""He placed his hand on the backpack of the child, the mother was pulling the child by the arm."" Winn admitted that the officer later grabbed the girl's sweatshirt by the arm.

Winn said the officer tried to ""mitigate the situation"" with the girl.

""The daughter wanted to stay as a sort of sit-in protest in the vestibule,"" Winn explained, calling her time in the vestibule an ""agreed-upon decision"" between the girl and the school. ""They had no responsibility to check on her,"" although ""one of the school officials did walk her to another part of the school to use the restroom.""

Winn did not address the legality of the mask mandate, but he noted that ""the schools still had a policy in effect which they were applying,"" and the officer assisted in that situation.

Igoe's videos did appear to capture his daughter's mother encouraging the girl to follow the school's rules and leave if she refuses to wear a mask.

Superintendent David Perry also cast aspersions on Igoe's account.

""The South Colonie Central School District will not comment on details of the allegations made by Mr. Igoe other than to state that the allegations in the complaint are both false and misleading,"" Perry told Fox News Digital.

On Wednesday, Igoe's daughter went back to school and agreed to wear a mask, because of the appeals court decision, he said.

""The following day I said, ‘Honey, you have to wear a mask tomorrow,’"" he told Fox News. He said she agreed: ""If the rule is I have to wear it, I’ll wear it.""

"New York's largest private health care provider fired 1,400 employees who refused the vaccine","New York’s largest private healthcare provider has fired some 1,400 employees who refused to get vaccinated for COVID-19, Fox News has learned.

A spokesperson for Northwell Health confirmed Monday that it ""had to exit"" 1,400 staff members but noted that most of its members chose to get vaccinated. With the ouster, Northwell’s employees are now 100% vaccinated.

""Northwell regrets losing any employee under such circumstances, but as health care professionals and members of the largest health care provider in the state, we understand our unique responsibility to protect the health of our patients and each other,"" the spokesperson said. ""We owe it to our staff, our patients, and the communities we serve to be 100% vaccinated against COVID-19.""

The spokesperson said that having a fully vaccinated staff will allow Northwell to ""provide exceptional care at all of our facilities, without interruption and remain open and fully operational.""

THOUSANDS PROTEST WASHINGTON STATE'S VACCINE MANDATE, SING NATIONAL ANTHEM

""Northwell believes that having a fully vaccinated workforce is an important measure in our duty to protect the health and safety of our staff, our patients and the communities we serve,"" she said.

New York began ratcheting up the heat last month for government workers and health care employees to get the vaccine. Hospitals and nursing homes in New York have begun removing workers for failing to meet a state-mandated deadline as Gov. Kathy Hochul pleaded with holdouts to get 11th-hour inoculations.

""To those who have not yet made that decision, please do the right thing,"" Hochul said at a press briefing. ""A lot of your employers are anxious to just give you the jab in the arm and say you’re part of the family, we need your help to continue on.""

NYC Mayor Eric Adams rejects border tour invite from Texas Gov. Abbott despite decrying migrant influx,"New York City Mayor Eric Adams rejected an invitation from Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to visit the U.S.-Mexico border despite decrying an influx of migrants overwhelming homeless shelters in the Big Apple.

In a letter addressed to Adams and Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser on the first of the month, Abbott, a Republican, said Texas has spent over $3 billion in the past 18 months ""to curtail the devastation felt by our communities large and small.""

While Abbott asserted that the crisis was created by President Biden, as illegal crossings have hit record highs repeatedly since he took the helm as commander and chief, Adams, a Democrat, has spent the past month criticizing the ""callousness"" of southern border states' leadership, such as in Texas and Arizona, for busing migrants elsewhere.

Abbott said that although Texas has been organizing bus rides for migrants to the U.S. capital, he has not been busing them to the Big Apple like Adams has claimed in recent weeks.

TEXAS GOV. ABBOTT INVITES NYC AND DC MAYORS TO VISIT SOUTHERN BORDER AND ‘SEE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS FIRSTHAND’

""Your recent interest in this historic and preventable crisis is a welcome development—especially as the President and his Administration have shown no remorse for their actions nor desire to address the situation themselves,"" Abbott wrote in an apparent double-edged comment toward Adams and Bowser, who have been his frequent critics. ""As Governor, I invite you to visit our border region to see firsthand the dire situation that only grows more urgent with each passing day, and to meet with the local officials, who like yourselves, realize this matter deserves immediate federal action. I also ask you to join me in requesting President Biden secure the border and put an end to this disastrous crisis.""

He told the mayors that Biden’s ""reckless open border policies have created a dangerous environment not only for tens of millions of Texans, but for communities all across the nation, including yours.""

""We agree that this crisis demands immediate federal action to prevent the flood of deadly fentanyl, now the leading cause of death for Americans ages 18 to 45, the unimaginable horrors caused by human smuggling and trafficking, the known terrorists from entering our country, and the countless other crimes that have been committed by the hundreds of thousands of ‘gotaways’ that the Biden Administration has let slip through,"" Abbott wrote. ""I look forward to welcoming you the Texas-Mexico border so that you can see this crisis for yourself. Please contact my office to make travel arrangements for your visits.""

But a spokesman for Adams’ flatly rejected the offer to visit the border.

""Instead of a photo-op at the border, we hope Governor Abbott will focus his energy and resources on providing support and resources to asylum seekers in Texas as we have been hard at work doing in New York City,"" Adams’ spokesman, Fabien Levy, said in a written statement. ""We continue to work with federal partners to receive additional financial resources immediately, but will never turn our backs on those in need who are arriving here.""

NYC MAYOR ADAMS ASKS FOR FEDERAL MONEY TO HANDLE ASYLUM SEEKERS' BUSES FROM TEXAS, ARIZONA

In a statement released in conjunction with the letter Monday, the governor's office said ""Texas has bused thousands of migrants to Washington, D.C. who would have otherwise been released into small border communities with more limited resources than the nation’s capital."" Last month, Abbott responded to Adams’ ""false accusations attacking the mission by calling on the mayor to direct his complaints to President Biden for refusing to secure the southern border,"" the statement added.

Adams, who leads the largest city in America, has been appealing to the federal government for additional funding to address the migrant influx.

The same day he was invited to the border, Adams announced an ""emergency procurement"" of shelter and other services for people seeking asylum in New York City. He noted that about 4,000 asylum seekers have entered the city shelter system since late May — the primary driver of the approximately 10% increase in the city's Department of Homeless Services’ census.

""New York is a city of immigrants, and we will always welcome newcomers with open arms. Over the past two months, we have seen a significant increase in the number of asylum seekers arriving in our city’s shelter system,"" Adams said in a statement. ""To fulfill our city’s legal and moral mandate to provide quality shelter to anyone experiencing homelessness, and to ensure we are providing appropriate services to asylum seekers, we are immediately issuing an emergency procurement declaration to rapidly procure additional shelter and services to serve these individuals and families.""

Opting for the term ""asylum seekers"" to describe the influx of migrants, Adams noted that New York City, known for its pro-sanctuary city policies, does not track individuals’ immigration status on intake forms to ""protect individuals from federal detainment or deportation, and because the city provides shelter to all who need it — regardless of immigration status.""

Recognizing both a humanitarian and security crisis at the border, Abbott launched Operation Lone Star in partnership with the Texas Department of Public Safety and the Texas National Guard in March 2021. Since then, the agencies have deployed thousands of troopers and guardsmen ""to combat the smuggling of people and deadly drugs like fentanyl from Mexico into Texas,"" the governor’s letter said.

Abbott said the operation utilizes air, ground, and tactical border security assets ""in an attempt to deny Mexican drug cartels and other criminals the ability to smuggle drugs and people directly into our state."" To date, the mission has led to more than 290,000 migrant apprehensions and more than 18,000 criminal arrests, with more than 15,000 felony charges reported.

""As law enforcement agents along the Texas-Mexico border respond to thousands of illegal crossings each and every day, putting their lives on the line for Texans and for all Americans, the crisis demands the attention of not only the Biden Administration, which is responsible for securing the border, but of leaders across the country,"" Abbott wrote. ""Unfortunately, President Biden and his ‘Border Czar’ Vice President Harris have refused to see this crisis for themselves—remaining willfully ignorant of the crisis that they have created. In fact, U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas recently testified that the border is ‘safe and secure.' It is neither safe nor secure, as you can both attest to.""",https://www.foxnews.com/us/nyc-mayor-eric-adams-rejects-border-tour-invite-texas-gov-abbott-despite-decrying-migrant-influx,N/A
NYPD clears out group of migrant 'single men' refusing eviction from ritzy Manhattan hotel,"New York City police officers cleared out an encampment of migrants who were refusing eviction from their temporary free stay at a ritzy Manhattan hotel Wednesday night.

The migrants, who City Hall described as mostly ""single men,"" slept on the street outside the Watson Hotel for three days following their eviction earlier this week. City officials planned to transfer migrants from the hotel to a 1,000-bed shelter in Brooklyn on Sunday. The illegal migrants , who were given free rooms at the $300-per-night Hells Kitchen hotel, refused to vacate, however, and were joined by activists rallying outside the building.

Images from the Wednesday night sweep show NYPD officers and vehicles grouping around the migrants as city workers clean up the area.

""We are grateful that almost all single men who were staying at the Watson Hotel have chosen to heed our calls and come inside from the frigid temperatures tonight,"" a spokesman for Mayor Eric Adams said in a Wednesday statement. ""The single men who were staying at the Watson have now all either chosen to transfer to the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal — a humanitarian relief center that multiple elected officials today called a ‘warm’ location — or decided to leave our care by connecting with friends, family, or other networks.""

ILLEGAL MIGRANTS REFUSE TO LEAVE NYC HOTEL FOR BROOKLYN MIGRANT RELIEF CENTER, SLEEP IN THE STREET

""To be clear, no arrests were made tonight, and the only items discarded were those on the street. Any items asylum seekers had in their rooms are still in our care and will remain available for pick up,"" the statement continued.

New York City has struggled to cope with the influx of thousands of migrants from the U.S. border, bussed to NYC on the orders of Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and others.

The city had received over 42,000 migrants by the end of January.

Mayor Adams sought to quash reports that the Brooklyn facility was inhumane with a visit to the shelter on Monday.

""I just had to come here when I started hearing all the rumors that it was too cold, my brother got on shorts. It’s warm inside. About the food not being there, healthy food is present,"" Adams said in a Twitter video.

Ohio teacher forced to resign after refusing to call students by preferred pronouns: Lawsuit,"A middle school teacher in Ohio alleges in a lawsuit against her former employer that she was forced to resign after refusing to refer to students by their preferred pronouns.

The lawsuit, filed in federal court on behalf of former Jackson Memorial Middle School teacher Vivian Geraghty by the Alliance Defending Freedom, states that her school district required teachers to participate in the ""social transition"" of students in her class who have ""'transitioned' to a gender that was inconsistent with their sex."" Jackson Memorial Middle School is in Massillon, Ohio.

Geraghty, however, refused to participate in the policy because of her Christian religious beliefs. The lawsuit alleges that the school ""ejected her"" within two hours of Geraghty telling principal Kacy Carter about her reservations to the policy.

""But as soon as Defendants found out that Ms. Geraghty had a religious basis for resisting their attempt to implement an orthodoxy, they forced her to resign. Within two hours of being notified that Ms. Geraghty had reservations about their approach to the issue on Aug. 26, without there ever being any complaint from a student or disruption of any school services, Defendants ejected her from the school,"" the lawsuit states.

When Geraghty went to Carter and Director of Curriculum, Instruction, and Assessment Monica Myers and informed them about her religious beliefs, they allegedly told the teacher that ""she would be required to put her beliefs aside as a public servant.""

ADF Legal Counsel Logan Spena said in a press release that the school district unconstitutionally forced Geraghty to resign.

Oregon bakery owners refuse to pay damages in gay wedding cake case,"The owners of an Oregon bakery are refusing to pay $135,000 in state-ordered damages to a same-sex couple who were denied service.

Melissa and Aaron Klein, owners of Sweet Cakes by Melissa, cited religious beliefs when they refused to bake a wedding cake for Laurel and Rachel Bowman-Cryer more than two years ago.

The couple were awarded the damages in July by Labor Commissioner Brad Avakian for emotional suffering, saying the owners had violated the women’s civil rights by discriminating on the basis of their sexual orientation. They were also slapped with a gag order that prohibited them from speaking publicly about their refusal to participate in or bake wedding cakes for same-sex marriages.

The Kleins have filed an appeal of the ruling and are defying the order to pay. They’re claiming financial hardship although crowdfunding efforts have raised more than $500,000 on their behalf, according to The Oregonian.

""It's difficult to understand the Kleins' unwillingness to pay the debt when they have, very publicly, raised nearly a half million dollars,"" labor bureau spokesman Charlie Burr told The Oregonian in an email Wednesday. ""They are entitled to a full and fair review of the case, but do not have the right to disregard a legally binding order.""

A lawyer for the Kleins, Anna Harmon, told The Oregonian she couldn't comment about her clients' actions, citing the ongoing litigation.

The dispute goes back to January 2013 when Bowman-Cryer came into the shop with her mother for a cake-tasting appointment. However, Aaron Klein told the women that the bakery didn’t do cakes for same-sex weddings.

The Oregonian reports the couple complained to the labor bureau, which prompted a state investigation, four days of hearings and Avakian’s July ruling.

The Willamette Week reported that the Kleins’ lawyers asked Avakian to delay enforcement of his order while the Oregon Court of Appeals reviews the case. They reportedly said the payment would lead to “financial ruin.”

However, Avakian repeatedly rejected the requests, citing the amounts raised for the Kleins from crowdfunding websites. He issued his final rejection notice on July 27.

A 2007 Oregon law protects the rights of gays, lesbians, bisexual and transgender people in employment, housing and public accommodations. It provides an exemption for religious organizations, but the agency ruled that exemption does not allow private businesses to discriminate against potential customers.

Pennsylvania 911 operator who refused to send ambulance charged in 2020 death,"An emergency 911 operator in Pennsylvania has been charged with manslaughter for not sending an ambulance to a home where a woman later died of internal bleeding.

Leon ""Lee"" Price, 50, of Waynesburg, was charged last week in the death of Diania Kronk, 54, who died in July 2020, after Kronk’s daughter dialed 911 for an ambulance to take her to the hospital, but one was never sent.

""I believe she would be alive today if they would have sent an ambulance,"" said Kronk’s daughter Kelly Titchenell, 38.

According to a legal filing, Price repeatedly questioned Titchenell about whether her mother would be ""willing to go"" to the hospital.

""She will be, 'cause I’m on my way there, so she’s going, or she’s going to die,"" the daughter said in the 911 recording.

In the recording, Price initially agreed he would request an ambulance to be sent to the residence before asking a couple more times if the woman would be willing to go to the hospital.

""We really need to make sure she’s willing to go,"" Price pushed.

""She’s going to go, she’s going to go,"" Titchenell repeated. ""Cause if not, she’s going to die, there’s nothing else.""

But Price refused to send the ambulance, a Green County detective said in the charges.

The dialog ended shortly after Titchenell said she was about 10 minutes from Kronk’s home, at which time Price instructed her to call them back once she had spoken with her mother.

""Call me when you get out there, OK?"" Price said in the recording.

Titchenell ultimately arrived at the home, finding her mother naked on the front porch speaking incoherently.

""She just kept saying she was OK, she's fine,"" the daughter said. ""She's the mom, you know — she doesn't listen to her children.""

Kronk did not go to the hospital and died the following day.

Price was additionally charged with reckless endangerment, official oppression and obstruction.

Greene County District Attorney Dave Russo, who is prosecuting the case, is also investigating whether there was any official training or policy in place that allows 911 dispatchers to refuse services.

""We all deserve equal protections, and we all deserve access to medical services,"" Russo said. ""I have a major concern as to the safety of the community in regards to this.""

Rescuers save 275 parrots after sanctuary owners refused to evacuate from Hurricane Ian,"Will Peratino and his partner Lauren Stepp would not leave their Pine Island compound, even as authorities pleaded with residents to abandon their homes because of damaged roads, including a collapsed bridge that prevented deliveries of food, gas and other life-sustaining supplies.

But the couple could not leave without their two lemurs and flock of birds — 275 parrots, including some of the world's rarest.

So a rescue mission — dubbed ""Operation Noah's Ark"" — was launched Tuesday to catch, cage and ferry the birds off the island, as a condition to persuade Peratino and Stepp to leave the island.

AS BALD EAGLE MAKES MIRACULOUS COMEBACK IN US, AUTHOR REVEALS THAT HUMANS ‘REDEEMED OURSELVES’

""We would not abandon them. I would never leave them. Never,"" said Stepp, as volunteers worked on collecting the flock from dozens of coops at the Malama Manu Sanctuary. ""If they cannot be fed or watered, they will die. And I can’t live with that.""

""Malama"" is the Hawaiian word for protect, ""manu"" means bird.

The birds have been relying on food donated by wildlife officials since Hurricane Ian hit, but the supply of fruit, peanuts and other edibles would soon be hard to come by because of the downed bridge and the scarcity of gasoline on the island.

Hurricane Ian battered Southwest Florida a week ago with 150 mph gusts, making some roads impassable and islands inaccessible. Wind-driven rains and ocean surges brought dangerous flooding.

In the hours before the storm, the sanctuary owners herded their flock of birds and packed them into their home to shield them from the ferocity of the elements.

""You don't know what we've been through here. We had four feet of water in the house, damned-near drowned,"" Peratino said, before succumbing to tears.

""To have every bird safe is a huge undertaking,"" Peratino said. ""I mean, it's almost impossible to do. So the kind of help we've gotten has been invaluable.""

Many of the birds were rescued from homes that could no longer care for them. Some are used for breeding rare species.

While the focus of many search and rescue missions has been on human life, there have also been pet rescues.

Bryan Stern, the founder and leader of Project Dynamo, which assembled four boats for the mission, said his team has rescued at least six dogs, three cats and, before Tuesday's massive rescue, three birds.

""Our animal numbers are about to be blown out of the water by 100 cages of parrots,"" Stern said, before embarking on the rescue mission.

QUIZ: NAME THAT BIRD! CAN YOU MATCH THESE BEAUTIFUL BIRDS WITH THEIR CORRECT NAMES?

""It's been nuts,"" said James Judge, who owns the boat ""Slice of Life,"" which led the small flotilla of rescue boats.

""Will and Laura, who own the sanctuary, their hearts and souls are in the birds. So they're going through their own suffering from the hurricane,"" Stern said, ""and having to rebuild their lives. They lost all kinds of stuff. Is the answer to that to lose more?""

The crew of volunteers was not about to let that happen.

For several hours Tuesday, the volunteers stuck nets and their bare hands into cages to pen the birds in cages. The birds — from macaws to cockatoos and rare specimens of king parrots (only two dozen pairs are kept in the United States) — squawked and flapped their wings and their handlers put them in cages.

Some whistled and spoke, including several with mischievous vocabularies.

FLORIDA BALD EAGLE HATCHLINGS NEARLY HERE: MAGICAL MOMENTS AWAIT BIRD LOVERS

Ghassan Abboud, a Chicago dentist who owns a bird farm in West Palm Beach, is an acquaintance of the sanctuary owners. When he heard of their plight, he mustered his resources to help. He had imagined commissioning a small boat to ferry cages from Pine Island to a dock on the mainland, where an air-conditioned trailer would transport the birds to his property across the Florida peninsula.

But by chance he came across the Project Dynamo team, who have been volunteering to help rescue people stranded by floodwaters and damaged roads.

""I could never write a script like this. It was perfect. I thought I’d be back all day long in a small boat,"" Abboud said. ""What these guys have done has been unimaginable. They dedicated their resources. They saved so many birds.""",https://www.foxnews.com/us/rescuers-save-275-parrots-sanctuary-owners-refused-evacuate-hurricane-ian,N/A
Virginia hospital denies unvaccinated patient spot on 'active' kidney transplant list,"A man seeking a kidney that could save his life is claiming that he has been denied a place on the active transplant list because of his COVID-19 vaccination status.

Shamgar Connors, 42, is a husband and father of two. He and his wife, a nurse, decided against taking the COVID-19 vaccine after the entire family suffered through the disease last year. However, a doctor at University of Virginia (UVA) Hospital allegedly told him that despite his prior COVID-19 infection, his unvaccinated status will not allow him an ""active"" spot on the list for a life-saving kidney transplant.

""Art said you're not interested in the COVID vaccine,"" UVA Hospital's Dr. Karen Warburton said to Connors, according to a recording of the call obtained by Fox News Digital. ""So, it is a requirement for you to be active.""

UCHEALTH DENIES KIDNEY TRANSPLANT TO UNVACCINATED WOMAN IN STAGE 5 RENAL FAILURE

According to the UVA Hospital website, Dr. Warburton is an associate professor with an American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) certification in nephrology, a specialization of internal medicine focused on the kidneys. Her clinical practice is centered on pancreas and kidney transplants.

""I just had COVID, so I don't -- so why would I get the vaccine?"" Connors responded on the phone. However, the hospital did not budge, according to Connors.

""You may have had delta, and that may not protect you against the omicron variant, which is what we're seeing now,"" Dr. Warburton continued on the recording from Jan. 6. ""So, our policy is that in order to have people active on the transplant list and get a transplant, you need to be fully vaccinated.""

Connors told Fox News Digital he has been diagnosed with Stage 5 focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) – a rare and dangerous condition, though he currently is ""at clearance,"" or managing to maintain a sustainable use of his scarred and irreparably damaged kidney. However, due to lack of a cure, the disease is terminal.

""FSGS is a disease in which scar tissue develops on the glomeruli, the small parts of the kidneys that filter waste from the blood. FSGS can be caused by a variety of conditions,"" according to the Mayo Clinic. ""FSGS is a serious condition that can lead to kidney failure, which can only be treated with dialysis or kidney transplant. Treatment options for FSGS depend on the type you have.""

Without a transplant, Connors's kidney will eventually fail in the long term. However, he won't be eligible for a transplant until he is made active on the list.

""So you're on the list, you're just not in an active status right now as we tie up all these other loose ends. So in order to be activated on the list, you will need to get the vaccine,"" the Dr. Warburton warned Connors in the recording of the call.

""Are you willing to do it?"" she asked on the phone, followed by a pause. When Connors didn't respond, Dr. Warburton continued, ""OK, so you don't want to move forward?""

""I'd rather die of kidney failure,"" Connors answered.

""OK, so this may be a crossroads that your, um, at your evaluation, because I don't – that's not – there's not going to be any exception to that. The science is pretty clear on the vaccine, and we have seen so many people die from COVID that we are requiring it.""

Connors told Dr. Warburton that he ""can show [her] a bunch of reports"" documenting '""all sorts of problems,"" associated with the coronavirus vaccine, but was told that his concerns were not enough to be exempt.

According to the recording, Dr. Warburton went on to give Connors two options – either stay inactive on the transplant list and pray that something changes, or close out the evaluation and live with his failing kidney.

""So, what is your wish at this point? Do you want to stay inactive on the list, and see what shakes out?"" Dr. Warburton asked. ""Or do you want to just have us close your evaluation, or what's your preference?""

Connors answered that he would remain inactive on the list.

""I was technically on the transplant list for three years,"" Connors claims. ""I was inactive on the transplant list until I started dialysis, then I became active – so that was two years ago.""

Connors said he's had kidney trouble almost his entire life. He has been vaccinated against a variety of diseases and said he has no objection to vaccination as a concept. He explained to Fox News Digital that the family's two sons are both vaccinated with the standard inoculations, but the COVID-19 vaccine's new technology, occasional adverse reactions and ongoing development of the vaccine through boosters made the parents uncomfortable.

Fox News Digital contacted UVA Health for comment repeatedly, but the hospital would not confirm nor deny vaccination as a requirement for transplants, saying that each candidate is evaluated on a ""wide range"" of variables to decide is someone seeking aid is ""a good candidate.""

""Unfortunately, the need for transplants far exceeds the availability of donated organs – at any given time, tens of thousands of Americans are on a transplant waiting list. Because of that shortage, every transplant center carefully evaluates every potential recipient based on a wide range of factors to ensure they are a good candidate for transplant surgery,"" Eric Swenson, spokesperson for UVA Health told Fox News Digital on Friday.

NORTH CAROLINA HOSPITAL SYSTEM NOVANT HEALTH TO FIRE 175 EMPLOYEES WHO REFUSED COVID VACCINE MANDATE

Swenson offered factors that could inspire a doctor to deny a candidate their needed transplant, including management of health and unrelated terminal illnesses.

""For example, patients may not be a candidate for a transplant if they have another life-threatening disease or condition that would not improve with a transplant,"" Swenson said. ""Transplant teams also evaluate a patient’s ability to manage their health and follow their care team’s instructions both before and after their transplant.""

""UVA Health is in the process of updating its evaluation criteria to address COVID-19 vaccination status as part of the individualized assessment we complete with respect to each transplant candidate,"" Swenson added.

Asked for clarification on if the vaccine is now a universal requirement to get a transplant at UVA, Swenson declined to comment. He similarly declined to explain if booster shots were required, along with other details of the transplant denial procedure.

""You have our reply. Have a nice evening,"" UVA replied to all follow-up questions by Fox News Digital.

After his call with Dr. Warburton, Connors said he then tried to file a religious exemption – crafted with the help of the couple's friend, a pastor – to UVA, but it was not accepted.

Additionally, a religious exemption request was denied by his wife's previous employer, where she worked as a nurse. She left that job due to noncompliance with vaccination mandates and has since continued working as a nurse at a different hospital, Connors told Fox News Digital.

The couple said they were contacted by attorney Kirk McKenzie, who is allegedly gathering similar cases for a lawsuit.

The family has also reached out to their local Rep. Rob Wittman, whose office confirmed they received the explanation of his circumstances.

""I'm not gonna let this depress me. I'm gonna fight this,"" Connors told Fox News Digital.

Connors said that he has been offered a kidney from multiple people – some of them strangers – but he refuses to take a donation until the current vaccine mandate on transplants is lifted, telling Fox News Digital that he will not be forced into taking the vaccine against his will, even at the cost of his own life.

When he received the news that he was off the active list, Connors recalled he told his wife, ""God's gonna take this and use it for good.""",https://www.foxnews.com/us/uva-hospital-refused-unvaccinated-transplant,N/A
Uvalde funeral homes refused to handle services for Robb Elementary school shooting suspect: report,"Uvalde, Texas, funeral homes did not want to handle services for accused Robb Elementary School shooter 18-year-old Salvador Ramos, forcing the local coroner to store his body for weeks as the family squabbled over the release of the remains, according to a report.

Uvalde County Justice of the Peace No. 4 Eulalio ""Lalo"" Diaz Jr., serving as the de facto county coroner, told The Houston Chronicle that funeral homes in Ramos’ hometown were already busy handling services for his total 21 victims killed in the May 24 massacre and did not want to worry about the notoriety brought upon their businesses if they agreed to handle the accused gunman’s remains.

""Once they got to him, the funeral homes in town said, ‘We don’t want to deal with him,’"" Diaz Jr. told the newspaper. ""I had to store him for three weeks. As the funerals for the victims were going on, I was still dealing with what to do with him. It was a stressful time.""

The Bexar County Medical Examiner conducted an autopsy on Ramos on May 27, but Diaz Jr. had to keep the body in storage for three weeks about a two-hour drive away from Uvalde in Lockhart, Texas, as Ramos’ splintered family squabbled over his body. Eventually, an out-of-town funeral home – Castle Ridge in Crystal City, Texas – stepped in to handle funeral arrangements, and Ramos was released to relatives, Diaz Jr. said. Ramos’ death report shows that he was cremated in a nondescript building on South Frio Street on the western edge of downtown San Antonio, according to the Chronicle.

UVALDE SHOOTING VICTIMS' FAMILIES PLANNING WHOPPING $27B LAWSUIT TARGETING LAW ENFORCEMENT, SCHOOL OFFICIALS

""It took three, three and a half weeks to get him released to the family,"" Diaz Jr. said. ""They were fighting with each other.""

The Chronicle reported that it is expected to take more than a year for the Bexar County Medical Examiner to complete the 22 autopsy reports following the carnage at Robb Elementary School, as the same agency was already tasked with handling the autopsies for the 53 migrants who died after being abandoned in a sweltering hot tractor trailer on the outskirts of San Antonio in June in what was considered the deadliest human smuggling incident in recent U.S. history.

Ramos allegedly shot his 66-year-old grandmother in the face on the front porch of her home before stealing her pick-up truck and driving it without a license toward the elementary school he once attended.

He crashed the vehicle into a ditch and shot toward people who came out of a nearby funeral home to help, hopping the school’s 5-foot fencing and approaching the building, as frantic educators hearing gunshots began to implement lockdown measures, according to a state investigate report.

The gunman entered the building through unlocked doors, and surveillance video shows Ramos clad in dark clothing move into a hallway and fire his gun toward two classrooms of fourth graders. He entered one of the classrooms known to have a door that did not secure properly, before spending about two-and-a-half minutes rapidly firing over 100 rounds between the two rooms before officers entered the building.

Still, despite nearly 400 law enforcement officers from several agencies arriving at the scene, it took more than an hour before a Border Patrol tactical unit ultimately breached the classroom and shot and killed Ramos, according to the report. Nineteen children and two teachers died in the attack.

Before the deadly shooting, Ramos had moved into his grandmother’s small home blocks away from the school after a blowout fight with his mother was livestreamed on Instagram and viewed by several family members. The teen’s father believed Ramos had no love left for him, according to the report.

Ramos, who was teased by peers that he would one day become a school shooter, allegedly was driven by the lure of Internet fame and developed a fascination with violence and rape online. A video showed him carrying a bag of a dead cat, idealizing animal abuse. He began pursuing his ""evil plan"" to shoot up the elementary school at the start of this year after a falling out with his mom, according to the report.",https://www.foxnews.com/us/uvalde-funeral-homes-refused-handle-services-robb-elementary-school-shooting-suspect-report,N/A

China refused call with Pentagon after F-22 shot down spy flight,"The Pentagon sought out a phone call between Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and his Chinese counterpart on Saturday after the U.S. shot down the Chinese spy balloon, but the offer was rebuffed, officials said Tuesday.

""Lines between our militaries are particularly important in moments like this. Unfortunately, the PRC has declined our request. Our commitment to open lines of communication will continue,"" Pentagon press secretary Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder said in a statement.

A F-22 fighter plane shot down the 200-foot-tall Chinese surveillance balloon off the coast of South Carolina on Saturday afternoon, about a week after it was detected over Alaska's Aleutian Islands.

China was initially conciliatory about the balloon, saying on Feb. 3 before it was shot down that the ""Chinese side regrets the unintended entry of the airship into U.S. airspace due to force majeure.""

After the spy airship was destroyed by a Sidewinder missile on Saturday, Chinese officials took a more aggressive stance.

""The U.S. should have properly handled such incidents in a calm and professional manner not involving the use of force, yet they decided to do otherwise, which is a clear overreaction,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said on Tuesday.

""The airship does not belong to the U.S. It belongs to China.""

China refuses to allow international coronavirus investigators until 'final victory' over outbreak,"Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.

China announced Wednesday that it will not invite international investigators to probe the origins of the novel coronavirus until the disease is fully defeated and a ""final victory"" is won.

Beijing's United Nations (UN) ambassador in Geneva, Chen Xu, made the comments during an online press briefing, according to France 24.

After being asked when the World Health Organization (WHO) would be allowed to conduct an investigation, he said the issue is a matter of priorities and called America's criticism of China ""absurd and ridiculous.""

""The top priority, for the time being, is to focus on the fight against the pandemic until we win the final victory,"" Chen said.

""It's not that we are allergic to any kind of investigations, inquiries or evaluations,"" he added. ""For whether or how the invitation will take place, we need to have the right priority setting at this moment, and on the other hand, we need the right atmosphere.""

The WHO has faced criticism from President Trump, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and various media outlets for its apologetic stance with regard to China.

SEN. RICK SCOTT PLEDGES TO HOLD 'COMMUNIST CHINA' AND WHO ACCOUNTABLE FOR CORONAVIRUS FALLOUT WITH CONGRESSIONAL PROBE

The agency has also received backlash for a January tweet citing Chinese officials who claimed there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission of COVID-19.

In addition, China was recently accused of censorship, destruction of evidence and a total lack of transparency in a leaked research dossier compiled by the so-called ""Five Eyes"" intelligence alliance.

While speaking with reporters last week, Trump claimed to have seen evidence that would suggest the virus came from a Wuhan laboratory and not from a wet market as was previously thought. He then shamed the WHO for its poor performance and highlighted its synchronicity with China.

""I think that the World Health Organization should be ashamed of themselves because they’re like the public relations agency for China,"" he said.

In February, before the virus had spread worldwide, Pompeo spoke with American governors and warned them of nefarious efforts by the Chinese government to infiltrate the political infrastructure of the U.S.

“We can’t ignore China’s actions and strategic intentions,"" he said at the time while addressing the National Governors Association's winter meeting. ""The Chinese government has been methodical in the way it's analyzed our system... it's assessed our vulnerabilities and it's decided to exploit our freedoms, to gain an advantage over us at the federal level, the state level and the local level.""

“Competition with China is happening. It’s happening in your state,"" Pompeo added. ""In fact, I'd be surprised if most of you in the audience had not been lobbied by the Chinese Communist Party directly.""

China's latest comments come on the same day that Florida Republican Sen. Rick Scott told Fox News he would be leading a congressional investigation into Communist China's involvement in the outbreak and pledged to discover where it originated, how the virus got out, and who is primarily responsible for the hundreds of thousands of deaths from COVID-19.

""We'll figure out whether the virus was created, whether it was released. Over time we will figure that out,"" he said. ""But the reality is, whether it came out of the wet market or whether it came out of the lab, the worst thing is they intentionally did not tell the world and look at what's happened.""

As of Wednesday afternoon, there were more than 3.7 million confirmed cases of the virus worldwide and over 260,000 deaths.

The U.S. accounted for at least 1.2 million of the confirmed cases and has had nearly 72,000 fatalities.

Germany at odds with US on condemning Hezbollah in Iran talks,"Germany’s government has refused to agree to a key U.S. demand to designate the entire Lebanese Islamic militia Hezbollah -- and not just a piece of it -- a terrorist organization as part of talks to rein in the nuclear program in Iran.

Two sources familiar with the U.S. talks with Germany, France and the United Kingdom over remedying defects in the Iran nuclear deal told Fox News of Berlin's stance, saying that German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s administration is the “least cooperative” of the three European powers.

Germany is resisting the U.S. negotiating team appeal---and President Donald Trump's position-- to outlaw all of Hezbollah because that demand, say German diplomats, is linked to Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. The sources said Germany views the Trump administration as too pro-Israel. As a result, Germany does not want to ban all of Hezbollah, specifically its “political wing,” within its territory, where 950 Hezbollah members raise funds and are recruiting members.

Hezbollah is Iran’s strategic partner in the Middle East and is said to have played a crucial role in the murders of over 500,000 people in the Syrian civil war. After a 2012 Hezbollah-organized terrorist attack in Bulgaria, in which five Israelis and a Bulgarian national were killed, the E.U. extended a ban only to the group's so-called military wing.

U.S. officials have met with European officials in London, Berlin and Paris over the last few weeks as part of efforts to improve the atomic deal with Iran, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).

When asked about Germany’s position, a U.S. State Department spokesperson reiterated Trump’s demands from January, telling FoxNews on Monday, “They should designate Hezbollah — in its entirety — as a terrorist organization.”

“They should designate Hezbollah — in its entirety — as a terrorist organization.” — U.S. State Department spokesperson to Fox News

The spokesperson said that “we are working closely with our European partners to address our shared concerns with the JCPOA and Iran’s malign behavior.”

The State Department official added that the U.S. has “discussed the six non-nuclear/regional issues that the president also identified and called for stronger steps from our European allies.”

In addition to proscribing Hezbollah as a whole as a terrorist entity, the spokesperson said Trump wants the Europeans to “cut off funding to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps [IRGC], its militant proxies, and anyone else who contributes to Iran’s support for terrorism.”

Trump designated the IRGC a terrorist organization in October.

The spokesperson said U.S. allies should “join us in constraining Iran’s missile development and stopping its proliferation of missiles, especially to Yemen.”

European countries “should join us in countering Iran’s cyberthreats” and “should help us deter Iran’s aggression against international shipping,” the official added.

Lastly, the spokesperson said that the European powers “should pressure the Iranian regime to stop violating its citizens’ rights. And they should not do business with groups that enrich Iran’s dictatorship or fund the Revolutionary Guard and its terrorist proxies.”

Germany’s foreign policy toward Iran’s regime is widely considered to be beneficial to the ayatollahs who rule the Islamic Republic there. In March, Berlin’s ambassador to Tehran, Michael Klor-Berchtold, praised Ali Larijani, the head of Iran’s quasi-parliament, who is infamous for his denial of the Holocaust.

Writing on his ambassador-to-Tehran Twitter feed, Klor-Berchtold said in English and Persian, “Good discussion with the Speaker of Iranian Parliament, Mr. Ali Larijani.”

According to the German magazine Spiegel, Larijani engaged in Holocaust denial at the 2007 Munich security conference when he said his country had “different perspectives of the Holocaust.”

In the mass-circulation tabloid BILD, Ambassador Klor-Berchtold was declared “loser of the day” for his meeting with Larijani and Hossein Amir-Abdollahian. BILD wrote, “No dialogue with Jew-haters.”

Amir-Abdollahian is an assistant to Larijani and the director general of international affairs for Iran’s parliament. In February, he called for the destruction of the Jewish state.

Growing economic relations between Tehran and Berlin may also be an impediment to Merkel's making concessions on the Iran nuclear deal. German exports to the Islamic Republic of Iran climbed to €3.5 billion in 2017, or about $4.3 billion, from €2.6 billion in 2016.

The U.S. spokesperson said that America ""continues to have productive talks with our European partners. We have discussed the areas the president identified in January where we wants to see improvements – including ensuring Iran never comes close to a nuclear weapon and addressing our concerns with the sunset dates, taking strong action if Iran refuses IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] inspections, and preventing Iran from developing or testing a long-range ballistic missile.”

The spokesperson added that “the deal’s greatest flaw is that its restrictions sunset over time, leaving Iran free in the future to pursue industrial scale nuclear fuel enrichment, an important step in achieving a rapid nuclear weapons breakout capability.”

Trump announced in January that the European would have until May 12 to work with the U.S. to improve the Iran deal. If the major powers in Europe do not meet Trump’s ultimatum, the U.S. will pull out of the nuclear pact and likely reimpose sweeping economic sanctions on Iran’s clerical regime.

The State Department spokesperson said: “This is a last chance. In the absence of a commitment from our European allies to work with us to fix the deal’s flaws, the United States will not again waive sanctions in order to stay in the Iran nuclear deal. And if at any time the president judges that agreement is not within reach, the United States will withdraw from the deal immediately.”

A German foreign ministry spokeswoman told Fox News by email that Foreign Minister Heiko Maas had spoken with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about ""important regional questions."" The German foreign ministry declined to answer detailed questions about its alleged recalcitrant behavior during the Iran talks or any desire to punish Israel.

FRENCH PRESIDENT MACRON'S DESIRE TO ‘PISS OFF’ UNVACCINATED INDIVIDUALS TRIGGERS OUTRAGE

Asked for comment by the outlet, a Macron spokesperson said, ""The president has doctors who define with him the rules that are acceptable or not in terms of his own health protocol."" Fox News Digital has reached out to the French Embassy in Washington for comment.

Macron opted to undergo a PCR test in France and an antigen test in Russia, both of which were negative, according to the report. He previously tested positive for COVID-19 in December 2020.

Another source close to the French president said that Russian officials were stringent and uncompromising with their protection of Putin's health, insisting that the world leaders be kept in a metaphorical health bubble.

However, it appears that Russian officials were not particularly upset by Macron's skittishness, so long as everyone followed the alternative rules.

UK's Boris Johnson refuses to apologize after saying Muslim women in burqas look like 'bank robbers',"Former UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is refusing to apologize despite pressure from Britain’s political class -- including Prime Minister Theresa May -- after he said Muslim women who wear the burqa look like “bank robbers” and “letter boxes.”



The Conservative Party MP made the remarks in a column for The Daily Telegraph, in which he pushed back against Denmark’s recent ban on the full body and face covering, saying that while he thought that the clothing looked “ridiculous,” he didn’t think a ban was an appropriate measure.



But his choice use of language to describe what women in the veil looked like drew ire in a country where criticism of Islam is a hot-button issue.



“If you tell me that the burqa is oppressive, then I am with you. If you say that it is weird and bullying to expect women to cover their faces, then I totally agree – and I would add that I can find no scriptural authority for the practice in the Koran,” he said, before adding that it is “is absolutely ridiculous that people should choose to go around looking like letter boxes.”

BORIS JOHNSON SUGGESTS TRUMP HANDLE BREXIT TALKS: 'HE'D GO IN BLOODY HARD'



Not finished, he said that he would ask anyone who came to his MP’s office with their face covered to remove it.



“If a female student turned up at school or at a university lecture looking like a bank robber then ditto: those in authority should be allowed to converse openly with those that they are being asked to instruct,” he said.



However, despite his comments, Johnson said he did not agree with a ban of the kind that have been enacted in many European countries such as Denmark, France and Belgium, arguing that it could “play into the hands of those who want to politicize and dramatise the so-called clash of civilizations; and you fan the flames of grievance.”



But despite the libertarian conclusion, and past polling that found a majority of Brits are in favor of a tougher stance on the burqa by the government, the outrage against Johnson was swift and vocal.



London Labour MP David Lammy called him a “pound-shop Donald Trump” and accused him of “fanning the flames of Islamophobia to propel his grubby electoral ambitions.”



Those calls were echoed by Brandon Lewis, the chairman of the Conservative Party, who said Johnson should apologize. Lewis’ comments were backed by May. She said it was imperative that people should be “careful” in the language they use in discussing the issue.



“It’s very clear that the language Boris Johnson used to describe people’s appearance has caused offense,"" May said. ""It's not language I would have used, I think it’s wrong to have used that language and I agree with Brandon Lewis.”



But Johnson brushed off the calls, with an ally of Johnson telling The Telegraph calls for him to apologize were “ridiculous.”



“If we fail to speak up for liberal values then we are simply yielding ground to reactionaries and extremists,"" the ally said.""It is ridiculous that these views are being attacked -- we must not fall into the trap of shutting down the debate on difficult issues.""



Johnson was backed up by fellow Tory MP Jacob Rees Mogg, who said he was unsure what it was that Johnson has to apologize for.

""It's hard to see what he should apologize for. He has defended people's right to wear the burqa whilst saying it is an inelegant garment,” he told the paper. “Neither of those two proposals are unreasonable.""

Yemen president challenged by ex-president's son,"Yemen's new president faced a new challenge Sunday when the powerful son of the man he replaced appointed his own person — a relative — to head a security unit to protect his father.

One of President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi's main goals has been to purge the military of his predecessor's cronies and relatives to enable reforms and restore security to the country in turmoil for more than a year.

These steps are seen essential to enable Yemen's armed forces to confront al-Qaida-linked militants, who have taken over parts of southern Yemen while the country has been distracted by the power struggle in the capital.

A senior military official in the Defense Ministry said former president Ali Abdullah Saleh continues to meddle in the country's affairs.

Ahmed Ali Abdullah Saleh, son of the former president, commands the powerful Special Forces and Republican Guard, among the country's best trained troops. His appointment of a relative, Tarek Mohammed, to head his father's security unit was direct insubordination to Hadi.

Hadi had already demoted Mohammed from head of the Presidential Guards to head a provincial military unit, an order Mohammed and the younger Saleh refused to obey.

The military official said Hadi has rejected the new appointment. In response, Mohammed refused to hand over his current job during a meeting attended by the U.N. representative to Yemen.

The official was speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media.

Another relative rejected an order to resign as head of the air force for weeks, finally stepping down last week. That dispute forced a shutdown in Yemen's commercial airport for a day.

Hadi took over from Saleh in February following nearly a year of street protests. In his purge efforts, he faces the risk that his predecessor's loyalists might cause massive disruptions rather than go quietly.

Earlier this month, the ex-president Saleh said in a statement that his loyalists should maintain leading roles in running the country's affairs to ensure stability, in clear defiance against attempts by his successor to purge them.

The ongoing power struggle could hamper the new government's offensive against al-Qaida militants. In recent weeks, troops have been engaged in daily battles with the militant group in southern Yemeni provinces.

Also Sunday, Yemeni security officials said three suspected al-Qaida militants were killed when a missile hit their SUV in northeastern Yemen. The officials had no details on the source of the attack or the identity of the three. U.S. drones have been active over Yemen, tracking and striking al-Qaida operatives with missiles.

The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief reporters.

The militant group said Sunday it released 73 soldiers captured by its fighters during battles with government forces in the south.

The terror network said in an emailed statement that the freeing of the soldiers followed mediation efforts by tribal elders and senior clerics. Relatives of some freed prisoners confirmed the release.

The soldiers were freed in the city of Jaar in the southern province of Abyan in a ceremony attended by top leaders of the terror network in Yemen, including military leader Qasim al-Rimi, witnesses and the statement said. The soldiers left in trucks and private cars for the nearby port city of Aden.

Al-Qaida has held Jaar for a year. The province's capital Zinjibar is also under al-Qaida control, but government troops fought their way into its center last week.",https://www.foxnews.com/world/yemen-president-challenged-by-ex-presidents-son,N/A
