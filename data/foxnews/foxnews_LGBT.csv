Stephanie McMahon says WWE will 'integrate LGBT characters' into storylines,"Darren Young made headlines in 2013 when he came out as gay in a casual airport interview, becoming the first openly gay active WWE superstar. If you're a new fan to WWE, though, you'd probably have no idea, as Young's sexuality isn't a part of his on-screen character. WWE Chief Brand Officer and Raw commissioner Stephanie McMahon revealed at a Beyond Sport United event that WWE may soon introduce LGBT characters and themes to its weekly programming.

Via NBC News:

""Throughout my life I have grown up knowing gay [WWE] superstars and executives. It's always been accepted, but now it's about getting that message out there.... We will integrate LGBT characters into our programming ... and I do think there will be an opportunity to integrate some of those storylines in the near future.... We've had GLAAD come in and speak to our entire writing team and give a whole tutorial on sensitivities, the right words, the wrong word [and] why those words matter.""

Although Young is the first openly gay WWE star, he isn't the first gay wrestler to work for WWE. WWE Hall of Famer Pat Patterson, who became the first Intercontinental Champion in 1979, had come out to the locker room decades before he made a public announcement in 2014 on a WWE Network special.",http://www.foxnews.com/sports/2016/08/11/stephanie-mcmahon-says-wwe-will-integrate-lgbt-characters-into-storylines.html,2016-08-11
Federal judge blocks part of Mississippi LGBT marriage law,"A federal judge ruled Monday that Mississippi clerks cannot cite religious beliefs to recuse themselves from issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples.

The ruling by U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves blocks the state from enforcing part of a religious objections bill that was supposed to become law Friday. Reeves is extending his previous order that overturned Mississippi’s ban on same-sex marriage. He said circuit clerks are required to provide equal treatment for all coupes, gay or straight.

The state’s religious objections measure, House Bill 1523, was filed in response to last summer’s Supreme Court ruling that legalized gay marriage nationwide. That ruling is called the Obergefell case, after the man who filed it.

""Mississippi's elected officials may disagree with Obergefell, of course, and may express that disagreement as they see fit — by advocating for a constitutional amendment to overturn the decision, for example,"" Reeves wrote Monday. ""But the marriage license issue will not be adjudicated anew after every legislative session.""

Attorneys were still waiting on rulings from Reeves in two other lawsuits seeking to block all of the religious objections law, including provisions that could affect schools' bathroom policies for transgender students.

Roberta Kaplan, a New York-based attorney, represents Campaign for Southern Equality in two lawsuits challenging House Bill 1523, including the one on which Reeves ruled Monday. She issued a statement praising his decision.

""A year after the Supreme Court guaranteed marriage equality in the Obergefell decision, we are delighted that Judge Reeves reaffirmed the power of federal courts to definitively say what the United States Constitution means,"" Kaplan said.

Spokesmen for Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant and Attorney General Jim Hood didn’t immediately comment on Reeves’ ruling. Attorneys for Bryant, a Republican, and Hood, a Democrat, defended House Bill 1523.

According to Reuters, Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves slammed Carlton Reeves’ ruling in a statement.

""If this opinion by the federal court denies even one Mississippian of their fundamental right to practice their religion, then all Mississippians are denied their 1st Amendment rights,” Reeves said. ""I hope the state’s attorneys will quickly appeal this decision to the 5th Circuit to protect the deeply held religious beliefs of all Mississippians.""

Trump's military transgender ban prompts LGBT outrage,"Most LGBT-rights activists never believed Donald Trump's campaign promises to be their friend. But with his move Wednesday to ban transgender people from military service, on top of other actions and appointments, they now see him as openly hostile.

Leaders of major advocacy groups depicted Trump's Twitter pronouncement as an appeal to the portion of his conservative base that opposes the recent civil-rights gains by the LGBT community.

""His administration will stop at nothing to implement its anti-LGBTQ ideology within our government — even if it means denying some of our bravest Americans the right to serve and protect our nation,"" said Sarah Kate Ellis, president of the LGBT-rights group GLAAD.

Transgender service members have been able to serve openly since last year, after a move by then-Defense Secretary Ash Carter. Trump's vow to end that policy was the latest, and perhaps the most stinging, of a string of actions since his election that have dismayed supporters of LGBT rights.

Some examples:

— The administration rescinded federal guidance advising school districts to let transgender students use the bathrooms and locker rooms of their choice. It said state and local officials should decide the issue.

— Several of Trump's high-level appointees have solid records as opponents of LGBT-rights advances, including Vice President Mike Pence, Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price.

— At Trump's direction, Sessions is developing new guidance on religious liberty for federal agencies that is expected to make it easier for people with religious objections to refuse to recognize LGBT rights.

— The Department of Justice on Wednesday filed an amicus brief in a case to which it's not a party, arguing that a federal civil-rights law doesn't cover sexual orientation. The case was filed in 2010, when a skydiving instructor sued his employer, saying he was fired for his sexual orientation in violation of the law.

— Six members of the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS resigned, asserting that Trump ""simply does not care"" about combating HIV and AIDS as it continues to beset the LGBT community.

The Human Rights Campaign, a national LGBT-rights group, depicted the Republican president's tweets Wednesday as a ""heinous and disgusting"" attack on transgender service members.

""It is also the latest effort by Trump and Mike Pence to undo our progress and drag LGBTQ people back into the closet by using our lives as political pawns,"" said the group's president, Chad Griffin.

Trump's pronouncement was hailed by some conservatives who have long complained that the military was undermining its effectiveness by allowing gays, lesbians and transgender people to serve openly. Opponents also have contended that the military should not bear the cost of any medical procedures related to gender transition.

""Our troops shouldn't be forced to endure hours of transgender sensitivity classes and politically correct distractions like this one,"" said Tony Perkins, a former Marine who heads the conservative Family Research Council.

Mara Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, denounced Trump's declaration as ""simple bigotry.""

""This attack has nothing to do with military readiness, reason or science,"" she said. ""It is indefensible.""

Among those dismayed by Trump's tweets was Lt. Cmdr. Blake Dremann, a transgender man who's served in the Navy for 11 years and received his latest promotion after the policy change last year.

""Trans service members are continuing to do our jobs,"" Dremann said. ""People know who we are now and it becomes personal, especially when you've got families that are going to be affected by this.""

Another active-duty transgender soldier, Army Capt. Jennifer Peace, said she was concerned how a possible ban would affect her, her family and other transgender service members.

""My command has told me in the past the only thing that we should discriminate on is job performance, and I hope that military leadership will handle this issue the same way,"" Peace said in an email.

Capt. Jacob Eleazer, a transgender man who serves in the Kentucky Army National Guard, said he was stunned by Trump's action.

""Fired by tweet. It was honestly pretty shocking,"" said Eleazer, who took the day off from his job as a therapist in Lexington, Kentucky, to assess the situation.

It's unclear whether Eleazer's career will be affected.

Eleazer, 31, has been in the military since 2006. In 2014, he told his superior officer he was transgender, and he got full support.

Attorney Sasha Buchert, a transgender woman who works for the LGBT-rights group Lambda Legal, recalled feelings of fear and isolation while serving in the Marines in the 1980s, decades before her gender transition.

""It's not a question of whether transgender people will serve,"" she said. ""It's a question of whether they'll be serving openly or will be hiding like they did in the old days.""

Another transgender veteran, retired Army Col. Sheri Swokowski, said it's important for transgender people and their allies to push back against Trump's decree.

Swokowski, 67, of Windsor, Wisconsin, transitioned to female after retiring from the military in 2004.

""The military has taught us to fight and this administration shouldn't be surprised when we do,"" she said. ""We need to impress upon the administration that we're not living in the dark ages.""

Gay gun activists: Growing LGBT push to support the Second Amendment,"Two years ago Chris Cheng came out of nowhere to beat seasoned marksmen, police officers and veterans to win History Channel’s reality shooting competition show “Top Shot.”

“When I auditioned, I was openly gay. But I was surprised as nobody cared. They only cared how well I could shoot and represent our season,” said Cheng, who quit his job at Google after the show and is now an NRA news commentator and is releasing his first book “Shoot to Win.” “There is this stereotypical view of the gun community as anti-gay rednecks, but nothing could be further from the truth. It was interesting as the History Channel never ‘outed’ me on the show even though they had hours of footage. I asked why and they said simply that it just wasn’t relevant.”

Indeed gay rights and gun rights often go hand in hand says Gwen Patton, the rep for gay gun rights organization Pink Pistols National.

“We don’t want people to hurt us, we want people to run away from us, and the best way we have found to do that is to be armed,” Patton said. “Now if someone tries to attack us, we can defend ourselves. Ideally we don’t want any altercation at all, but if there is a perception that the gay person on the street could have a concealed gun, it might make the perpetrator think twice.”

According to FBI Hate Crime Statistics, sexual orientation is the second largest motivator for bias crimes in the United States, second to racial bias, and far exceeding the number of religious or ethnically-spurred hate crimes.

Patton said while she has never had to use her firearm in defense, another gay member of a local Philadelphia chapter recently did.

“All he had to do was display it, no bullets were fired,” she said. “Guns can be a very useful tool, but society has turned them into something they are not. They aren’t the boogeyman.”

There are now more than 45 Pink Pistols chapters nationwide. With its slogan “pick on someone your own caliber,” members get together at least once a month at local ranges to practice their shooting skills, share self-defense tips and talk about gun safety. According to Cheng, bringing gays and guns together serves as an important conversation starter.

“Many in the LGBT community simply have never seriously entertained the notion of owning a firearm, or thought whether they want to be a victim or if they want to survive an attack,” he said, while Patton says it's false that the right is all about keeping firearms, while the left pushes gay rights.

“So some think of us as traitors,” she explained. “But at the end of the day, it’s about recognizing that the government shouldn’t be taking our rights away – our rights to be armed, and our rights to be happy and with the person we love.”

Of course the push for concealed carry has may opponents. Ladd Everitt, communications director for the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, said that hate crime is an issue our federal government has taken very seriously, pointing out the Hate Crimes Prevention Act passed by Congress and signed into law by President Obama in 2009.

“The law contains explicit protections for members of the LGBT community,"" he said. ""If groups like Pink Pistols are feeling targeted or under threat, it might be from members of their own community in the pro-gun movement.""

Will Tennessee's anti-LGBT law spell the end of 'Nashville?',"ABC's Nashville has received deserved praise for its handling of Will Lexington's (Chris Carmack) struggles with his sexuality, and his whole coming out storyline. But now, some of the show's stars find themselves in the middle of a real-life battle over a recently-passed Tennessee law that discriminates against LGBT people.

House Bill 1840, which Gov. Bill Haslam signed into law this week, gives therapists and other mental health professionals the right to refuse to treat patients whose lifestyles go against the professional's ""sincerely held principals.""

When the bill was still under review, Nashville star Connie Britton spoke out against it, telling The Hollywood Reporter: ""I shoot a TV show in Tennessee, and honestly, if they proceed with this, I'm not necessarily going to feel comfortable working there. That is a tricky situation because of course we employ a lot of people in the state, and you certainly don't want to have to interrupt that, but at the same time, this is the only way that we can have our voices be heard.""

Added Carmack -- who, according to THR, is reconsidering buying property in Nashville because of the law: ""We said, 'Do we want to live in a place like this?' ... I guarantee you that there are many more individuals like myself and my fiance who are potential long-term transplants from all over, who are saying, 'Is this a place I would want to call home, a place that would write this sort of thing into legislation?'""

25 great LGBT characters in pop culture

A ""tricky situation,"" indeed. ABC has yet to renew Nashville for a fifth season, but if it does, Carmack and Britton's comments beg the question: does the show's cast and crew have a responsibility to put their money where their mouths are, so to speak, and refuse to shoot in the state? Certainly Britton's comments, more so than Carmack's, will be perceived as an empty threat if the show continues to film there. Perhaps rather than pulling production from the state, the cast and crew of Nashville can use their influence to raise awareness and money for LGBT rights issues, and fight the good fight from within.

On the other hand, if ABC isn't planning to renew Nashville, this could be a nice opportunity for the network to put an activist label on its decision. Particularly because it would be difficult if not impossible for the show to relocate elsewhere, since so many scenes are tied to actual Nashville hotspots, including the Bluebird Caf and the Grand Ole Opry -- not to mention the local musicians who provide much of the show's music.

Earlier this year, a similar bill in Georgia drew a collective outcry from the stars and production companies of several TV shows and movies that are produced in the state, including The Walking Dead, The Vampire Diaries and the Hunger Games franchise.

ABC's parent company, Disney, joined a handful of entertainment companies, including Marvel, CBS and Lionsgate, to protest that legislation, saying, ""We will plan to take our business elsewhere should any legislation allowing discriminatory practices be signed into state law.""

In the wake of the proposed boycotts, the Georgia bill was vetoed. More recently, a similar law in North Carolina has also sparked boycott announcements from Fox, A&E and Hulu.

Disney has made no public comment on the Tennessee law and has no plans to do so at this time, according to an ABC rep. But again, the Georgia legislation was just a bill, and the aim of the boycott was to discourage the governor from signing it into law. The Tennessee legislation, on the other hand, has already been signed into law. It's much more difficult to repeal an existing law, than to prevent something from becoming a law in the first place.

In all likelihood, ABC will not renew Nashville and the entire point will be moot. But it would be nice to see the show take as much of a stand off-screen -- and stand with stars Britton and Carmack -- as it has on-screen, when it comes to LGBT issues.",https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/will-tennessees-anti-lgbt-law-spell-the-end-of-nashville,N/A
Chick-fil-A partnership with Pittsburgh Marathon causes ire among LGBT activists,"The Pittsburgh Marathon ran into some problems earlier this month when it announced Chick-fil-A as the official title partner for its children’s race.

Pittsburgh Three Rivers Marathon, Inc. (P3R) announced its partnership with Chick-fil-A Pittsburgh late last month and celebrated with a family-oriented event on Oct. 2. Children posed for photos with the iconic cow mascot dressed in running gear and took home prizes and coupons.

Chick-fil-A Pittsburgh serves as the title partner of the kids' marathon and a presenting partner for Kids of STEEL, a nutrition and activity program for children in southwestern Pennsylvania.

“We’re grateful to Chick-fil-A for their support and are thrilled they share our commitment to inspiring the next generation of runners throughout the Pittsburgh region,” Troy Schooley, P3R senior vice president, said in a statement.

NORTH CAROLINA CHICK-FIL-A WORKERS, DINERS PRAY FOR STAFFER BATTLING CANCER IN VIRAL VIDEO

But the partnership was decried by some, including LGBT activists.

“Oh, no no [Pittsburgh Marathon] has brought [Chick-fil-A] on as a sponsor of their youth races,” Sue Kerr, founder and editor of the Pittsburgh Lesbian Correspondents blog, wrote on Twitter. “[LGBTQ] youth & youth from non-Christian faiths deserve better. This is a divisive, hurtful choice.”

On her blog, Kerr argued it’s “highly inappropriate for any Christian organization or business to eagerly jump into anything to do with youth and children right now,” citing the ongoing sex abuse controversies in the Catholic Church and the sexual misconduct allegations recently levied against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.

MARYLAND MAN DEFACES CHICK-FIL-A, SYNAGOGUE WITH GRAFFITI ABOUT RELIGIOUS VIEWS, POLICE SAY

Chick-fil-A is known for its founder’s strong Christian beliefs. The fast food restaurants are traditionally closed on Sundays for employees to “set aside one day to rest and worship if they choose,” the company says.

The company encourages store operators to have “a positive impact in the local community” and be “on the lookout for ways to help their communities.” The Chick-fil-A Foundation has also donated about $1.5 million to the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, a non-profit sports ministry group.

Kerr and others have circulated a petition demanding P3R retract its partnership with Chick-fil-A Pittsburgh. Nearly 500 signatories have been collected for the online petition.

In response to criticism, P3R said it “strives to be inclusive of any and all members of the Pittsburgh community” and promised to continue “to be accepting of any individual or family who wants to participate in our events.”

“Our intent with this partnership, along with all of our partnerships, is to further expand all of our events and programming … This partnership with Chick-fil-A will help us ensure even more children in southwestern Pennsylvania can learn and share in our love of running,” it said in a statement online.

Earlier this year, the American Customer Satisfaction Index’s Restaurant Report found Chick-fil-A to be the No. 1 fast food chain. It came out on top in 2017 as well.",https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/chick-fil-a-pittsburgh-marathon-causes-ire-among-lgbt-activists,N/A
'LGBT' sandwich causes controversy: 'Using an entire community for publicity and profit',"A U.K. retail chain is getting toasted roasted on social media over a controversial sandwich.

In celebration of Pride festivities in the U.K., Marks and Spencer recently began offering its “LGBT” sandwich — a guacamole-inclusive twist on a BLT — complete with packaging decorated with the colors of the rainbow flag.

WHOLE FOODS TO RELEASE 'ROYAL ADDITION CHEESE' UPON ROYAL BABY'S BIRTH

But despite praise from some within the LGBTQI+ communities, the item raised more than a few eyebrows on Twitter, with some accusing the retailer of marginalizing the community and culture.

“Shame on the good folks over at @marksandspencer for turning our culture and identity into a sandwich,” one woman wrote. ”Making an absolute mockery of lgbtq people,” she added.

“I identify as #lesbian @marksandspencer[,] not a f---ing lettuce,” wrote another critic. “Why don’t you make an ethnic minority or disability sandwich while you’re at it!!”

BRITISH SUPERMARKET CHANGES NAME OF 'GENTLEMAN'S' SANDWICH AFTER BACKLASH

Others, meanwhile, likened Marks and Spencer’s marketing move as “propaganda” or an attempt to profit off the LGBTQ community.

“Good Morning Britain” host Piers Morgan also called the idea “truly pathetic on Twitter,” writing, ""Is there no cynical virtue-signalling depth struggling companies won’t now plunge to make a profit?”

A representative for Marks and Spencer did not comment on the response to its sandwiches, but the retailer has released a statement detailing the charitable contributions Marks and Spencer is making in honor of Pride.

""M&S has an amazing LGBTQ+ colleague network and with them we’ll be celebrating Pride 2019. For the second year running, we have created a sandwich as part of the celebrations and have received great feedback from both colleagues and customers,"" a spokesperson confirmed in a statement obtained by Fox News.

""Alongside this, we’re also donating £10,000 to [The Albert Kennedy Trust,] the national LGBTQ+ Youth Homelessness charity.”

A statement obtained by The Sun also confirmed the chain would be donating 1,000 Euro to BeLonG To Youth Services, a charity supporting LGBTQ youth in Ireland.

Despite the controversy, the sandwich has its supporters within the LGBTQ community.

“It’s a shame I can’t eat the M&S #LGBTSandwich but I’m really glad such a famous corporate company is on our side,” one wrote.

“Yes it's just a sandwich, but it goes a long way to [normalizing] being LGBT doesn't it? Seeing something that supports you on every shelf in a massive shop. no?” added another.

“They do loads for LGBT communities internally within their business and through external support including the funds this raises... easy to [criticize] brands for ‘rainbow washing’ but by god I’d have f---ing killed for my mum to have to see an LGBT sandwich when I was growing up,” another user added.",https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/marks-spencer-lgbt-sandwich-controversy,N/A
Film to help families prevent LGBT youth suicides,"When families reject their lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender (LGBT) children, it dramatically increases the youths' risk for suicide. Experts hope a new film aimed at families - religious families in particular - will help ease the tensions that drive those youngsters to kill themselves.

The 20-minute film, called ""Families are Forever,"" follows the journey of a devout Mormon family whose 13-year-old son comes out as gay. The family discusses its reactions, decisions and how they reconciled their beliefs with their son's announcement.

The film and supporting materials, part of a growing series, quickly get to the heart of the matter, said Caitlin Ryan, director of the Family Acceptance Project at San Francisco State University, which produced the film.

""We have to give people a way to understand how . . . they can support a LGBT child even if it's not in sync with their religious beliefs or cultural values"" Ryan told Reuters Health.

The Family Acceptance Project had previously found that LGBT youth who report high levels of family rejection are more than eight times more likely to report attempting suicide, compared to similar kids whose families don't reject them.

Family acceptance of LGBT children is tied to better physical and mental health, however.

The multimedia package, available in English and Spanish, is meant to help families identify and change behaviors that make their LGBT child feel rejected and to increase supportive behaviors, Ryan said.

Even though parents may be engaging in rejecting behaviors out of care or concern, they are nevertheless ""contributing to health risks, conflict and estrangement in the family,"" said Ryan.

The film and its accompanying discussion guide and family education workbook were added in March to the Suicide Prevention Resource Center Best Practice Registry. Ann Hass, a senior consultant to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, told Reuters Health that the registry is a collection of research-based and peer-reviewed suicide prevention programs, selected in ""a pretty rigorous process.""

""The addition of Caitlin Ryan's work to the registry is such a step forward in terms of the ability people in communities to do some LGBT-related suicide prevention,"" said Hass.

So far, this is the only LGBT-related program in the registry to incorporate faith-based themes.

Rather than writing off religious families as culturally or socially conservative, Ryan said, ""We have to understand that all of these families share some common fear and concerns and challenges.""",https://www.foxnews.com/health/film-to-help-families-prevent-lgbt-youth-suicides,N/A
'It does get better': Advocates address suicide in LGBT community,"Deric Metzger calls his former boyfriend, Brian Shaughnessy a “survivor.”

“When Brian was younger, he was diagnosed with leukemia. And of all the things he lost, fighting leukemia, his compassion and sense of humor weren’t among them,” Metzer, 32, told Fox News. “He lost weight, he lost years of his life and he lost his hair, but he still knew more about his nurses and doctors than they knew about him.”

Shaughnessy survived the cancer and dyed his hair wacky colors as it grew back. Metzger said when people asked about Shaughnessy’s hair, he would tell them how he had cancer and he had beat it.

Despite overcoming cancer and the trials that come with battling a serious illness, Shaughnessy tragically killed himself on June 17, 2009, when he was only 24 years old.

After entering college, Shaughnessy began presenting symptoms of schizophrenia, a mental illness the Mayo Clinic describes as a severe mental disorder in which people interpret reality abnormally. Symptoms of schizophrenia can include, hallucinations, delusions, and extremely disordered thinking and behavior.

Shaughnessy’s diagnosis manifested in different ways throughout his relationship with Metzger. For example, they took very few photos together because Shaughnessy believed they would somehow be harmful for Metzger.

“Schizophrenia has a genetic component, sure, but some recent research indicates it can be induced by trauma, and trauma almost more than mental illness is the greatest precipitating factor to suicide for most people,” Metzger, who is currently a group facilitator for Survivors of Suicide Loss (SOSL), said. “And when we talk about mental illness and suicide, especially among minority groups, we always look for that one cause.”

Shaughnessy suffered through many traumas in his early battle with cancer but Metzger believes that his suffered additional trauma because of his sexuality. Metzger said that one of the direct contributing factors to Shaughnessy’s suicide was Prop 8, a vote by Californians that made gay marriage illegal in the state.

“It’s amazing how with something that ultimately unimportant to who you are as a person can be considered persona non grata or public enemy number one by a certain vocal minority of people,” Metzger said.

Dr. Jack Drescher, a clinical professor of psychiatry at New York Medical College who was on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) V workgroup on sexual and gender identity disorders, told Fox News that while many mental illnesses are genetic, there are psychosocial aspects to mental health.

“If you stress a person with a vulnerability for depression enough, they can get very severely depressed and become suicidal,” Drescher said. “If you belong to a stigmatized minority group, whether it’s a racial minority group or… a gender or sexual minority group, there is an increased risk because there are all of these…moments in your life where you may be subject to stressers that the majority does not usually experience on a regular basis.”

Jillian Weiss, of the Transgender Legal Defense & Education Fund, told Fox News that these stressers can include, “employment discrimination, education, health care access, public accommodations. When people have to confront these things on a daily basis, it can make life more difficult.""

Metzger believes factors like this contributed to Shaughnessy’s death.

“When you already have the trauma of an unsupportive world, and you factor in things like Prop 8, surviving Leukemia, having a mental illness, feeling incorrectly that you’re a burden on other people, that people would be better off without you, because that’s what your mind is telling you, because it’s already made the decision to self-destruct, and it’s just reverse engineering a way to get you to that place” he said.

Suicide rates within the LGBT community are higher than the general population, especially among youth. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), nearly 29 percent of LGB youth had attempted suicide at least once in the prior year compared to 6 percent of heterosexual youth.

Weiss emphasized that while being a member of the LGBT community doesn’t automatically make a person more prone to suicide attempts, those who live in an open and tolerant societies are more prone to flourish.

“When they live in societies where they’re seen as lesser than and made to feel there is something wrong with them then, of course, we’re going to find more difficulties in people’s lives,” Weiss said.

Both Weiss and Metzger offer words of hope to the LGBT community. Metzger works to inform people who have suicidal thoughts and their loved ones that there are places that can offer assistance and urges others to speak out.

“The only weakness when it comes to suicide is silence, period,” he said. “And as someone who lost somebody to suicide, as somebody who in the aftermath of that tried to kill themselves, I need you to know – it’s a cliché but it does get better.”

Weiss echos Metzger and wants LGBT youth to know that life in the community isn’t bleak.

“The fact is that, you know, someone who is growing up, who realizes that they are gay or bisexual, transgender, the fact is they are going to be part of a very vibrant community of people who are contributing to our country and who are in all professions, of all backgrounds,” she said.

"LGBT health concerns need special attention, experts say","Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) communities have their own specific needs when it comes to health and medicine, according to experts.

Yet LGBT people often avoid seeking medical care because they're afraid they might face discrimination or that doctors might not understand their special health needs, said Barbara Warren, an expert on LGBT health and health policy, speaking at a discussion on LGBT health sponsored by the Thomson Reuters Pride At Work chapter in New York City on January 15.

Or they may seek medical care, but not ""come out"" to their healthcare providers.

Does it matter if healthcare providers know whether a patient is lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender? Yes, said Warren, who is director of LGBT Programs and Policies in the Office of Diversity and Inclusion at Mount Sinai Health System in New York City.

Warren said LGBT health concerns should be discussed for several reasons.

First, people will have better health outcomes if they feel comfortable with their providers. Additionally, the LGBT community suffers from the stress of being a minority, which can impact people’s health. And certain clinical issues are different in the LGBT community.

For example, she said, members of the LGBT communities – especially lesbian and bisexual women - may be at an increased risk for some cancers and conditions if they don’t get regular healthcare.

“We do know that a percentage of LGBT people avoid and delay screening and care because of fear about or experience of stigma, discrimination or simply lack of knowledge about LGBT people and their health amongst providers,” said Warren. “If you avoid or delay screening and care and you have an issue that may be precancerous, by the time you get into screening and care you’re there because it has become acute and you already have a progressed disease.”

“All of those are factors that go into why it’s important both for your providers to be trained and sensitive and to get it, and why it’s important for you to come out to your providers as who you are and be as open as you can be,” Warren said.

She said the National LGBT Cancer Network advocates training providers to be sensitive in helping a person come out and to do all the screenings that are necessary.

While estimates vary, a 2014 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says about 97 percent of U.S. adults identify as straight, about 2 percent as gay or lesbian and about 1 percent as bisexual.

The LGBT community also faces an increased burden of mental health concerns, including depression, anxiety and substance abuse - but this doesn't mean LGBT people are inherently mentally ill, Warren said.

Instead, she said, LGBT mental health issues are largely related to the stresses of belonging to a minority group. “We can change that by changing the way the world perceives, treats and includes LGBT people.”

Kellan Baker, also speaking at the Thomson Reuters event, said there has been a lot of progress on U.S. policy issues regarding LGBT health.

“We have seen an incredible explosion of initiatives that are inclusive of or focusing on LGBT communities from the federal government over the last five years,” said Baker, a senior fellow with the LGBT Research and Communications Project at the Center for American Progress in Washington, D.C.

He highlighted Healthy People 2020, which lists the nation’s objectives on health and includes a topic area specific to LGBT health.

Also, Baker said, the 2010 Affordable Care Act - better known as Obamacare - ""has a lot to offer LGBT community members. One of the biggest things is simply the expansion of health insurance coverage.”

Baker said access to coverage ties into many of the topics Warren mentioned, such as getting screened for certain conditions and seeing a healthcare provider on a regular basis.

AOC rebuked for 'demanding' Japan 'embrace LGBTQ alphabet wokeness' during controversial Asia trip,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , D-N.Y., is coming under fire after she called out Japan for not being tolerant enough during a congressional trip to Asia.

Ocasio-Cortez targeted Japan in an almost 40-minute-long Instagram video, during which she said that she was shocked at ""very discriminatory"" comments from a member of the Japanese government on the LGBT community.

""There was a member of the Japanese administration that was caught in off-the-record comments making very discriminatory statements about LGBT people,"" she explained in an Instagram video that she streamed live on Monday.

""It is quite shocking, I think it's fair to characterize this as [a] pretty shocking development,"" Ocasio-Cortez added.

AOC, OTHER POLITICIANS PAID THOUSANDS IN CAMPAIGN CASH TO CHINESE FOREIGN AGENT

""It is our view that marriage equality and LGBT protections being enacted in Japan would [play] a very strong and important role in U.S. and Japan relations,"" the congresswoman said.

But political commentators and journalists did not take kindly to Ocasio-Cortez advising Japan on how to conduct its affairs.

Political commentator Ian Miles Cheong summed up the congresswoman’s visit in a tweet: ""AOC is currently in Japan demanding that their government embrace LGBTQ alphabet wokeness, or else.""

""Japan’s internal affairs are none of AOC’s business,"" journalist Sameera Khan fired back, sharing headlines from Time and Bloomberg News on the controversial trip.

One user agreed, advising that Ocasio-Cortez to stick to American politics: ""[K]ind of a far out concept, but how bout we focus on America.""

AOC FIRES BACK AT 'REPUBLICAN MELTDOWN' OVER GAS STOVES: 'THERE IS VERY CONCERNING SCIENCE'

""Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other Democrats urge Japan to advance LGBT rights,"" Time headlined. ""Ocasio-Cortez says it’s ‘critical’ Japan moves forward with LGBTQ rights,"" Bloomberg wrote.

""Japan is the only member of the G-7 that does not have marriage equality and LGBT anti-discrimination equality protections in place,"" Ocasio-Cortez told her over 8.6 million followers on Instagram.

The original video she posted to Instagram has already received over 520,000 likes.

""The more we can all share our values across countries, the more we can cooperate,"" Ocasio-Cortez said of the U.S. and Japan.

She also emphasized the importance of ""women’s rights and LGBT, trans rights and marriage equality"" not just in Japan, but ""across borders"" as well.

Ocasio-Cortez also raised eyebrows when she visited the nuclear accident site in Fukushima, Japan, sharing her thoughts about the experience in a number of lengthy Instagram stories.

""For me, understanding + studying the science and scale of radiation puts me more at ease. More information makes me feel better. But that might not be the case for everyone,"" Ocasio-Cortez wrote on her trip to Fukushima.

One Twitter user focused on energy policy called it a ""[m]assive cultural shift"" in the favor of nuclear energy.

""She has 9 million followers, many of whom are young women,"" he added.

"First Emmys for children heavily focuses on LGBT content, 'woke' shows aimed at kids","The first annual Children’s and Family Emmy Awards had numerous speeches and awards focused on LGBTQ messaging in an event catering to kids from ""infancy to age 15.""

The two-night award show, created by the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, bestowed awards on numerous productions containing discussions on gender ideology, and winners occasionally made references to similar progressive topics.

Of all the programs awarded and subsequent acceptance speeches this past weekend, 1 in 4 of them included some information regarding gender identity or sexual orientation.

The first night was hosted by dancer and TikTok star JoJo Siwa, who often refers to herself as ""pansexual."" At the start of the show, XOMG pop group, a dance troupe of young girls dressed in futuristic rainbow-colored outfits, performed onstage before Siwa introduced herself.

CALIFORNIA EARLY CHILDHOOD TEACHER ADMITS USING 'GENDER UNICORN' TO INSTRUCT KIDS ON SEXUAL ATTRACTION

""I’m a pop star, a reality tv star, a dancer, a singer, a choreographer, a social media influencer—some would even call me a gay icon,"" she said.

""Muppet Babies"" received an award for Outstanding Writing for a Preschool Animated Program. The ceremony specifically highlighted the controversial ""Gonzo-rella"" episode, in which the character Gonzo tries on dresses and uses they/them programs to identify as non-binary.

Speaking with Fox News Digital, ""Heroes for Liberty"" children’s book series editor Bethany Mandel said that content that introduces ""gender bending"" philosophy, like ""Gonzo-rella,"" has detrimental consequences for kids. She said developing children often categorize people around them by gender when they first begin to speak.

""When you take away this very primal basic way to categorize and understand the world around them, you’re talking away a developmental tool that can’t be replaced. And that’s what they’re doing,"" Mandel said.

She also noted that between 2017 and 2019, an entertainment industry insider conducted a study that found a 222% increase in representation of LGBTQ characters on children’s television shows.

Later in the show, Sesame Street’s ""Friends with a Penguin"" won the award for best original show. In the episode, LGBTQ celebrity Billy Porter wears a gown and sings about his unorthodox friendship. Porter has on several occasions worn dresses to make a political statement about Black masculinity.

NONPROFIT PARTNERED WITH AFT PROVIDES BOOKS WITH SEX IMAGERY, DRAG QUEENS AND GENDER IDEOLOGY TO K-12 TEACHERS

Kathryn Raio Rende, the song's composer, accepted the award and gave a special shoutout to ""all the LGBTQUIA kids"" across the world, before walking offstage.

Sesame Street won again that night for Outstanding Preschool Series, with the ceremony showing a clip from the episode ""Family Day,"" in which a character introduces her brother and his husband.

Mandel says that content like this will continue to win accolades as part of the ""woke"" Hollywood club’s feedback loop and was unsurprised by the number of awards handed out to shows discussing gender identity. She surmised that those shows won awards because they were representative of the overall content currently ingratiated in children’s entertainment.

""They want to promote this idea of introducing all of this content to children because they’re trying to break ‘generational hate.’ And what it comes down to is they think that parents are not doing a good enough job, and they’re not enlightened enough—they’re not woke enough,"" she added. ""And it’s their job and their mission to fix that and to fix children.""

Kristi Reed, who worked on Netflix’s ""CentaurWorld,"" won the award for Outstanding Voice Direction for an Animated Series. During her speech, she discussed her childhood growing up as a ""queer kid in a small town,"" and asserted that programs like the ones shown at the award show had the power to ""erase generations of hate"" that tells the bullies of the world to ""suck it.""

PENTAGON'S SCHOOLS INFESTED WITH SHOCKING PORNOGRAPHIC MATERIAL FOR MILITARY KIDS: 'TIME TO SEND A D*CK PIC'

Netflix’s ""Heartstopper"" was the big winner of the night, bringing home four awards, including Young Teen Series. The show is a romantic coming-of-age drama centered on a relationship between two teen boys in England. Many of the characters in the show have diverse sexual identities. One scene shows a young boy forcefully push another up against a wall and kiss him.

""Most of all, with Heartstopper we wanted the next generation of LGBTQUIA kids to see themselves in a story about queer joy, about love and about acceptance,"" Executive Producer Patrick Walters said during the acceptance speech.

During an acceptance speech for Netflix’s ""We The People,"" created by Barack and Michelle Obama’s Higher Ground production company, Executive Producer Chris Nee came on stage in a pink Women’s March beanie.

Another executive producer, Elizabeth Ito, who worked on Netflix’s ""City of Ghosts,"" urged the Emmys to return the land she accepted the award on to indigenous people of the area.

Pro-LGBT Netflix star Sebastian Croft faces wrath of trans community for appearing in Harry Potter video game,"Some pro-transgender Twitter users slammed actor Sebastian Croft for appearing in a game with ties to author J.K. Rowling, who has been attacked for being anti-trans.

Croft, who made it big on ""Heartstopper,"" a Netflix series about high school boys who fall in love, denounced Rowling on Twitter in a post that has been viewed over three million times.

The actor told his fans that he was cast in ""Hogwarts Legacy"" — an action role-playing game set in the "" Harry Potter "" universe — years before he knew about Rowling’s ""views"" on transgender issues.

""I was cast in this project over three years ago, back when all Harry Potter was to me, was the magical world I grew up with. This was long before I was aware of JK Rowling’s views. I believe wholeheartedly that trans women are women and trans men are men.""

DEBATE RAGES ONLINE OVER NEW 'HARRY POTTER' VIDEO GAME: 'SHE WHO SHALL NOT BE NAMED'

The official Twitter account for ""Hogwarts Legacy"" broke the news on Jan. 11, revealing that Croft was the voice behind one of the main characters in the game.

While most comments were positive, some users complained that Croft was acting like a hypocrite.

One user commented that ""this is so horribly ironic I don't even know what to say.""

HARRY POTTER BOOKS STRIPPED OF J.K. ROWLING'S NAME ARE THEN RESOLD BY 'BOOKBINDER ARTIST'

Another Twitter user with the name ""transisawesome"" didn't buy Croft's story as to why he chose to voice act for ""Hogwarts Legacy"" and called him out for not supporting ""trans people.""

‘""[Q]ueer was always here’ includes trans people,"" the user wrote. ""Just reminding you bc you apparently forgot what your own merch stands for.""

Croft apologized and promised his fans that he would do better in the future. ""I know far more now than I did three years ago, and hope to learn far more in the next three. I’m really sorry to anyone hurt by this announcement. There is no LGB without the T,"" the actor wrote, adding a heart sign.

The actor amassed a huge following partially for his role on ""Heartstopper,"" an unapologetically pro-LGBT show that premiered in April 2022. It is also extremely popular online, drawing over nine billion views on TikTok, alone. The game ""Hogwarts Legacy,"" on the other hand, has only 49 million views on TikTok.

Catholic school hit for canceling LGBT play for 5-year-olds,"LGBT Canadians are furious after a Catholic school district canceled performances of a play about gender identity – meant for children as young as 5 years old.

“I fear these cancellations may be based on misinformation, grown out of fear, intolerance, transphobia, homophobia and misogyny,” wrote Jessica Carmichael, the artistic director of the Carousel Playhouse.

Click here to join Todd’s Facebook page – one of the fastest-growing Conservative communities online!

The playhouse had been scheduled to perform a play called, “Boys, Girls and Other Mythological Creatures.” The show had already been booked in five elementary schools in the Niagara Catholic School District.

The play features an 8-year-oid boy who dresses as a girl and questions his gender, The Globe and Mail reports.

“In the play, Simon(e) feels boxed in by the restrains of gender,” Carmichael wrote in a letter posted on the playhouse website.

It turns out the Canadian government believes it’s appropriate to discuss transgenderism with small children – without their parents being present. I’m surprised the actors didn’t try to give the kids condoms.

Carmichael defended the production by referring to guidelines approved by the Ontario Ministry of Indoctrination…pardon me – Ministry of Education.

The curriculum states: “It is also critical to student success to create an atmosphere in which students of all body shapes and sizes, abilities, gender identities and sexual orientations, and ethnocultural, racial and religious backgrounds feel accepted, comfortable and free from harassment.”

The play was initially performed for one Catholic grade school – and it did not take them long to realize the content was definitely not age appropriate.

The school district released a statement explaining that the play “was not originally presented as a play about gender identity.”

Kudos to Catholic educators for standing their ground and ordering the playhouse to pack up and get out of their schoolhouses.

And while LGBT groups are accusing the Catholics of being homophobic and transphobic, others are applauding their resolve.

“It’s appalling for any school board, let alone a Catholic one, to use a cutesy play to force gender ideology and whatever the latest social fad is on kids who are nowhere near equipped to process this information,” education activist Tanya Allen told LifeSiteNews.

As I wrote in my new book, “The Deplorables’ Guide to Making America Great Again,” grade schools have been turned into left-wing indoctrination centers. It’s imperative for parents to engage with educators so they can fight back against the social justice warriors.

Otherwise, American and Canadian schools will simply become playgrounds for the gender and sex revolutionaries.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/catholic-school-hit-for-canceling-lgbt-play-for-5-year-olds,N/A
"Democrats, LGBT activists’ sinister plan to crack down on Christian schools","If California Democrats have their way, Christian colleges and universities will no longer be allowed to require students attend chapel services or require them to profess a relationship with Jesus Christ.

Senate Bill 1146 would close a loophole that lawmakers say allows Christian universities to discriminate against students based on their gender identity, gender expression or sexual orientation.

Click here to join Todd’s American Dispatch - a must-read for Conservatives!

“All students deserve to feel safe in institutions of higher education, regardless of whether they are public or private,” said Senator Ricardo Lara, the author of the legislation. “California has established strong protections for the LGBTQ community and private universities should not be able to use faith as an excuse to discriminate and avoid complying with state laws.”

The legislation has already passed the Senate and is expected to clear hurdles in the Assembly. Thus far, Lara has refused to compromise with the state’s Christian colleges and universities.

“No university should have a license to discriminate,” he said in a statement.

If the loophole is closed, it would only exempt schools that prepare students for pastoral ministry.

“It discriminates against religious colleges, said John Jackson, the president of William Jessup University. “If we don’t play ball with state — the state will attempt to drive us out of existence.”

Click here to get Todd’s latest book - an investigation into the war on religious liberty.

The president of the Sacramento-based university called the proposed legislation chilling.

“The passage of this bill would destroy the foundation upon which this university was founded,” said Jackson. “Systematically discriminating against religious institutions and preventing student access and choice to Christian higher education is bad policy and will have a negative effect on the state of California.”

Lee Wilhite, vice president of university communications at Biola University, said they, too, have serious concerns with the bill.

“It functionally eliminates the religious liberty of all California faith-based universities,” he told me. “It really does infringe on how we carry out our mission.”

Like most Christian universities, Biola integrates the Bible through all of their courses — something they’ve been doing for more than 100 years.

If the loophole is closed, it could have a devastating impact on faith-based institutions.

“We would no longer be able to require a profession of faith for students,” Wichita said. “That’s something Biola requires of all incoming students.”

Schools would no longer be allowed to integrate faith throughout their teaching curriculum, he added.

Leaders at three universities I spoke to say that they would not be allowed to require mandatory chapel attendance or mandatory core units of Bible courses.

“The danger for Biola University is that it prevents us from carrying out our mission the way we have for 108 years,” Wilhite said. “It would eliminate our ability to continue our mission. That’s why it has our attention.”

The legislation would also give students a right to sue if — for example -- they were offended by a prayer in a class.

Biola and William Jessup refute the notion that LGBT students are discriminated against on their campuses.

“We don’t tolerate harassment or bullying of any of our students,” Wilhite told me.

Many of the schools are working with the Association of Independent California Colleges and Universities to urge Lara to amend his bill to include a religious exemption.

“If passed without amendments, the new law would also very likely disqualify students attending California Christian colleges and universities from eligibility for Cal Grants, a key state-level student aid program,” wrote Kurt Krueger, president of Concordia University Irvine.

Azusa Pacific University president Jon Wallace, penned a passionate op-ed for the San Gabriel Valley Tribune.

“Sen. Lara wants to safeguard LGBT students. We want the same protection for all students, including members of the LGBT community. The bill calls for more transparency from schools about their beliefs and recourse for unfair treatment. We share his concerns about student safety, transparency and recourse. With every prospective student, we share who we are, we provide the framework for how we build community and do life together and we ask those who enroll to uphold our student standards of conduct. Right now the proposed bill would invite challenges to required chapel attendance and public and communal observation of Christian sacraments such as the Eucharist and baptisms, among other activities central to our identity.”

Several of the universities I contacted said they are going to respectfully stand their ground -- even if it means taking their case to the Supreme Court of the United States.

“We are not willing to change our policies,” Jackson said. “There is a very intentional attempt to marginalize those who don’t accept the notions of sexual orientation and gender identity as the government has framed them.”

And Jackson warned that what’s happening in California could happen in other parts of the country.

“Religious freedoms are in play in California,” Jackson told me. “Ultimately, I’m concerned that what begins in California rolls across the nation.”",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/democrats-lgbt-activists-sinister-plan-to-crack-down-on-christian-schools,N/A
"Donald Trump will be a friend, an ally and an advocate for the LGBT community","Donald Trump's announcement on ""60 Minutes"" Sunday night, that he supports marriage equality, shocked almost as many on the left as his stunning victory at the polls last week. If they would have been paying attention, however, neither of these events would have come as a surprise.

Despite the left's attempts to demonize Donald Trump as a homophobe during the campaign, the truth was and is that Donald Trump is unquestionably, the Republican Party's most pro-gay presidential nominee in history.

Since the awful terrorist attacks in Orlando, Donald Trump made a passionate and sincere outreach to the LGBT community -- promising to do something that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton would not do: protect LGBT Americans from the barbarism of radical Islam.

Orlando was not the beginning of Trump's outreach to the LGBT community, indeed it is much more of a natural continuation of Trump's long-time record of treating LGBT people with fairness and equality in the business sector.

While Hillary Clinton was busy supporting Don't Ask, Don't Tell and the Defense of Marriage Act, Donald Trump was hiring LGBT Americans, promoting LGBT Americans and offering benefits to the partners and families of LGBT Americans

While Hillary Clinton was busy supporting Don't Ask, Don't Tell and the Defense of Marriage Act, Donald Trump was hiring LGBT Americans, promoting LGBT Americans and offering benefits to the partners and families of LGBT Americans.

Donald Trump has long been a friend, an ally and an advocate for the LGBT community.

It was at Donald Trump's Republican National Convention that an openly gay speaker -- PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel -- spoke in prime time. Not only did he speak in prime time, he spoke about being a proud gay man, about how the party needed to avoid the fake culture wars and he did this all to a standing ovation from Republican delegates.

It didn't end with just Thiel's speech, in his speech accepting the Republican nomination -- the most important speech he has ever given in his life -- Donald Trump chose to do something that no other Republican nominee has ever done before: to speak out on behalf of LGBT Americans.

Again, just as with Thiel's speech, Trump's impassioned defense of the LGBT community was met with thunderous applause from the Republican delegates. Trump paused as the crowd came to its feet that night and then said, in a moment of revealing candor, ""I have to say as a Republican, it is so nice to hear you cheering for what I just said. Thank you.""

It is clear from that ad-libbed line that Trump wasn't sure how the crowd would react, which makes his decision to defend the LGBT community in his speech even more powerful.

Trump repeatedly attacked Hillary Clinton during the campaign for her hypocrisy on LGBT issues. Noting in the debates that Clinton has taken tens of millions of dollars from regimes that kill people for being LGBT.

Since his election, not only has Trump made it clear that marriage equality is settled law, he also selected an openly gay man for his transition team (another GOP first) and may be on the cusp of selecting the first openly gay cabinet member.

The arguments against LGBT people voting for Trump generally had absolutely nothing to do with Trump's record or position on LGBT issues. Instead, we were treated to attacks on the record of his running mate and the words contained in the GOP's party platform.

Neither the platform nor the vice presidential nominee matters -- what matters is where the nominee of the party stands -- and Mr. Trump has made it clear, in both words and deeds, where he stands on LGBT issues.

The Republican Party platform is a meaningless document. It carries no legal weight. Nothing in the platform is binding on the candidate or the party, and for decades the presidential nominees of both parties have routinely distanced themselves from their official platforms.

As for the selection of Indiana Governor Mike Pence for vice president? The vice president's position on LGBT issues doesn't matter, either.

Don't believe me? Just ask the gay left that spent eight years telling us that Vice President Dick Cheney's position on LGBT issues did not matter because he was the vice president and it was the president who set policy.

This is Donald Trump's GOP now and his new Republican Party is one that is not only open and accepting of LGBT Americans, it is a party committed to defending us.

The self-appointed LGBT elites might not like Donald Trump, but rank and file LGBT Americans should know that Donald Trump's victory last week is a victory for our community.

LGBT conservatives don't buy into the woke Left’s radical view that sex and gender are meaningless,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

LGBT conservatives are committed to the fight for equality and inclusion. The Log Cabin Republicans advocate for inclusion within the ranks of our own party, and over the years we have had both significant wins and challenging setbacks.

At the same time, we aren’t afraid to call out anyone on the Left who uses ""equality"" as a Trojan Horse to push a radical cultural agenda that, in reality, has nothing to do with actual LGBT rights.

That’s what happening now. Over the last month, we’ve watched a major new culture war erupt on two fronts: Disney doubling down on teaching kindergartners about gender identity and the NCAA unfairly allowing trans women to compete in women’s sports.

NCAA IS TEACHING GIRLS AND WOMEN THEY DON'T DESERVE TO COMPETE ON A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD

We’ve watched the Left dishonestly demonize concerned parents and concerned female athletes as ‘anti-trans’ or ‘bigots.’

next Image 1 of 4

prev next Image 2 of 4

We can’t be bullied into silence. Simply put, LGBT conservatives don’t buy into the Woke Left’s radical notion that sex and gender are meaningless. Their demands have nothing to do with LGBT rights, and everything to do with their years-long campaign to strip away sex and gender as significant mores of Western society under the guise of ""equality.""

The Left is actively trying to rearrange our politics, our culture, our courts, and our schools to align with their radical woke views on sex, gender and race.

It is one thing to support, as we do, transgender individuals' rights to transition freely at an appropriate age, live safely, and be respected without fear of being harassed. It’s quite another to demand that teachers should be allowed to build lesson plans around gender and sex for kindergartners, without the involvement or consent of the parents.

If that demand sounds ridiculous, it’s because it is, but that’s exactly what Disney, a company supposedly built around family and children’s entertainment, called for when they came out in opposition to Florida’s Parental Rights in Education law.

Disney peddled lies from Left-wing activists about the bill -- that it was somehow anti-gay -- to hide it’s real intent to stop educators from teaching young children that their gender doesn’t matter.

NEW JERSEY SCHOOLS WANT TO TALK TO KIDS ABOUT SEX—AND KEEP IT A SECRET

Disney is opposed to the Florida law for the same reason they are stripping all references to ‘boys and girls’ from their theme parks: it’s part of their campaign to erase sex and gender from our culture, and they’re hoping to fool the public by calling it ""equality.""

Log Cabin Republicans was proud to speak out against the Democrats’ and Disney’s lies about the Florida law and defend parents -- including LGBT parents -- who are concerned about what their young children are being taught in school. As long as the Woke Left pushes this radical war and deceptively hides it behind the banner of ""equality,"" LGBT conservatives will be at the frontlines fighting back.

The Left is opening another front of their war in women’s sports and we will fight there as well. It’s one thing to support and include trans athletes. It’s quite another to demand that trans women have the right to compete in women’s sports, pretend that they don’t have an obvious physical advantage over their peers, smear those who disagree as anti-trans, and then cheer a win for ""equality"" while young women are shoved into second-place and robbed of athletic and educational opportunities.

If those demands sound ridiculous, it’s because they are. This is exactly what unfolded at the NCAA championships, when Lia Thomas, a trans woman, defeated nearly a dozen biological women and won the Division I national championship title in swimming.

Tragically, many of the so-called ""women’s advocacy groups"" who claim to fight for women have abandoned these swimmers, either because they’re afraid of being smeared by the Left or are complicit in their crusade.

They may not fight for those women, but we will. LGBT conservatives refuse to bow down to the Left’s preaching that there are no physiological differences between men and women, we don’t believe that LGBT equality comes at the expense of desecrating women’s sports, and we reject the Democrats’ and the media’s dishonest smears that Republican efforts to protect women's sports are ""anti-trans.""

There are common-sense solutions to this sports problem. Some have proposed creating separate sporting events for trans athletes; others have proposed requiring trans athletes to compete in competitions aligned with their bioligical sex. There’s a way to fairly include trans athletes in athletics without taking opportunities away from others or demonizing the trans community. But radical Leftists won’t even let the discussion happen.

Conservatives are waking up to what is going on. The Left is actively trying to rearrange our politics, our culture, our courts, and our schools to align with their radical woke views on sex, gender and race. It’s why the Florida law prompted such a fierce smear campaign from the Left; it’s why President Biden’s Supreme Court nominee shockingly refused to define what a woman is; and it’s why anyone concerned about the future of women’s sports is being slandered as anti-trans.

Obama's LGBT Executive Order endangers religious liberty,"President Obama signed an executive order Monday barring federal contractors from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity – ignoring the pleas of Christian and other faith leaders to include an exemption for religious organizations.

“Thanks to your passion and advocacy and the irrefutable rightness of your cause, our government – the government of the people, by the people and for the people – will become just a little bit fairer,” the president told a gathering in the White House.

The executive order would prevent Christian and other religious organizations with federal contracts from requiring workers to adhere to the tenets of their religious beliefs. Christianity Today reports the order could impact religious non-profits such as World Vision, World Relief and Catholic Charities.

[pullquote]

“If religious organizations cannot require that their employees conduct themselves in ways consistent with the teachings of their faith – then, essentially, those organizations are unable to operate in accordance with their faith,” Peter Sprigg, Senior Fellow for Policy Studies at the Family Research Council, told me.

Join Todd on Facebook for Conservative Conversation!

He said the president’s order forces employers to put aside their principles in the name of political correctness. “This level of coercion is nothing less than viewpoint blackmail that bullies into silence every contractor and subcontractor who has moral objections to homosexual behavior,” Sprigg said.

“The mask is coming off of the homosexual movement’s agenda. They really do not believe in religious liberty. They want forced affirmation of homosexual and transgender conduct to trump every other consideration in the workplace – including religious liberty.”

A group of prominent religious leaders, including Rick Warren, founder and senior pastor at Saddleback Church, wrote a letter to President Obama urging him to include a religious exemption.

“In a concrete way, religious organizations will lose financial funding that allows them to serve others in the national interest due to their organizational identity,” they wrote. “When the capacity of religious organizations is limited, the common good suffers.”

Not surprising, the president’s executive order was warmly welcomed by left-wing organizations like Americans United for Separation of Church and State.

“Religious groups have no right to accept taxpayer money and engage in rank forms of discrimination,” said executive director Barry Lynn. “Faith-based groups that tap the public purse should play by the same rules as everyone else and not expect special treatment.”

But that’s really not the point. This is about the federal government bullying religious groups that hold viewpoints it deems inappropriate.

As I wrote in my new book, “God Less America,” this administration believes gay rights trump everyone else’s rights – including religious rights.

Vice President Joe Biden went so far as to declare as much during a speech to international gay rights activists.

“I don’t care what your culture is,” he said in remarks covered by Associated Press. “Inhumanity is inhumanity. Prejudice is prejudice is prejudice.”

That explains why a Christian baker in Colorado was ordered by a state commission to undergo re-education training after he declined to participate in a gay wedding celebration.

That explains why a Christian photographer in New Mexico was found guilty of discrimination for refusing to photograph a gay wedding ceremony.

That explains why Democratic lawmakers in multiple states tried to shut down Chick-fil-A because of the owner’s privately held beliefs about traditional marriage.

And I as detail in “God Less America,” that explains why Billy Graham – “America’s pastor” – was subjected to an Internal Revenue Service audit after he supported a traditional marriage amendment in North Carolina.

The Obama administration and its militant cronies want to tell Christians whom to hire, how to run their business and how to think.

And now the president has decreed that any religious group that holds viewpoints divergent from the LGBT agenda is not worthy of federal tax dollars.

Last month, National Security Adviser Susan Rice told a gathering at the White House Forum on Global LGBT Human Rights that it was their responsibility to sway theological thinking on the LGBT issue.

“For the faith community, how can we reinforce to religious groups that God loves all the children of his creation equally?” she asked the crowd.

“Change will come,” she went on to say. “It’s already coming.”

Indeed, it has. And it appears the president has decided to “reinforce” the government’s theology on Christians by using his pen and phone.

And woe be to any Christian American who refuses to comply.

Denny Burk, professor of biblical studies at Boyce College, the undergraduate arm of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Ky. addressed the issues at hand in an essay titled, “Are Christian Colleges Free to be Christian?”

“There are people who are willing to use whatever means necessary to force religious institutions to conform to the new sexual morality,” he wrote. “Any individual or institution that refuses to comply will have to face the consequences.”

So what is the next logical step in the government’s systematic effort to marginalize Christianity? Robert Jeffress, pastor of the First Baptist Church in Dallas, suggests to me that churches might want to play close attention to their tax-exempt status.

“The problem with this executive order is that it paves the way for the next one – which could withhold the tax-exempt status or broadcast licenses for religious organizations holding biblical beliefs with which the administration disagrees,” Jeffress told me.

Students opposed to LGBT agenda shamed in classroom,"Teenagers at a California high school were publicly shamed for disagreeing with speakers allowed to push an LGBT agenda during an English class, according to several upset parents.

The Queer Straight Alliance at Acalanes High School, in Lafayette, lectured students in several ninth-grade English classes on Jan. 29 about LGBT issues, according to Brad Dacus, president of the Pacific Justice Institute, which is representing the parents.

During the class, the students, ages 14 and 15, were instructed to stand in a circle. Then, they were grilled about their personal beliefs and their parents’ beliefs on homosexuality, PJI alleges.

“The QSA had students step forward to demonstrate whether they believed that being gay was a choice and whether their parents would be accepting if they came out as gay,” PJI attorney Matthew McReynolds said. “Students who did not step forward were ridiculed and humiliated.”

PJI is a law firm that specializes in religious liberty cases. They are representing several families who had children in the freshman classes -- some of whom also are angry because there was no parental notification of the LGBT lecture.

“Singling out students for ridicule based on their moral or political beliefs is a Marxist tactic that should have no place in the United States of America,” Dacus said.

During the lecture, the Queer Student Alliance provided students with the names of the gay and lesbian teachers at the high school. They also had students line up to demonstrate where they fell on the “gender spectrum.”

“It was an exercise in gender fluidity,” the parent of one child told me. “They told the students that one day they could come to school feeling like a boy and the next day they could come to school feeling like a girl.”

Students were given a handout with LGBT terminology – including words like pan-sexual, demi-boy and gray gender.

Demi-boy/girl is defined as someone who only partially identifies as a man or woman. Gray gender defines someone who feels as though they sort of fit inside the gender binary, but that their gender is more hazy and undefined.

“Acalanes High School and the district have defied common sense, ignored the law and broken parents’ trust,” McReynolds said in a prepared statement. “These administrators are acting like schoolyard bullies. If they think intimidation is going to work on us or these parents, they are greatly mistaken.”

“It was a public outing,” one parent told me. “My child is being raised in a family with conservative values. We are a Christian family. What bothers me the most is the school is being dishonest and secretive about what’s happening. My son’s value system and our belief system is not being respected on a many levels.”

And from a very practical point – she wants to know why the Queer Student Alliance was allowed to take over an English class.

“There’s no other club at the high school that gets face time in front of freshman English classes for an entire period,” the parent said.

So why is Acalanes High School outing students who may not agree with every facet of the LGBT agenda?

Superintendent John Nickerson tells me it’s all about tolerance.

“The classroom instruction in question was part of a tolerance workshop led by peer educators under the supervision of teachers,” Nickerson wrote to me in an email.

That’s all well and good – but were the teenagers academically qualified to teach a class on issues like “gender fluidity”? Why weren’t the teachers teaching the class? And what about the allegations that students were bullied by the Queer Student Alliance?

“We are aware of the concerns and allegations raised by two parents and the Pacific Justice Institute,” he wrote. “We are investigating the situation, learning activities and classroom environment.”

This happens to be the same high school that invited a “pleasure activist” from Planned Parenthood to teach sex education to the freshman class. Students were encouraged to ask each other questions like “Is it okay if I take my pants off?”

The parent I spoke to bristled at the notion the LGBT class was about tolerance.

“They are tolerant of everyone except people who have Christian values,” she told me.

PJI sent a letter to the school district demanding an explanation of what happened. They believe the classroom lecture violated the privacy rights of the students.

“It should be self-evident that, as a fundamental privacy right, students cannot be ‘outed’ during class time by being made to declare their beliefs and feelings about sensitive sexual matters, any more than a student could be required to announce their sexual orientation,” PJI wrote in their letter to the school district.

Has it really come to this, America – forcing students to declare their allegiance to the LGBT agenda? Maybe they should just stick to teaching English in English class.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/students-opposed-to-lgbt-agenda-shamed-in-classroom,N/A
Supreme Court could echo photographer’s free speech victory over mandated LGBT wedding support,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

City officials in Louisville, Kentucky, needed a lesson in free speech and government overreach. Thankfully, a young mom with a small business there provided it, with an assist from the judiciary.



It’s a lesson the U.S. Supreme Court will hopefully reiterate in just a few months to government officials nationwide.



That Louisville mom is Chesley Nelson, an artist who started her own photography studio, Chelsey Nelson Photography. Like many other artists, Chelsey pours herself into her creations while serving her clients with excellence. She joyfully serves clients of all backgrounds, including those who identify as LGBT, but just can’t express messages she disagrees with — whether that is photographs demeaning others or photographs promoting political views she disagrees with. For Chelsey, it’s all about what a photograph communicates, not who asks for it.

SENATE GAY MARRIAGE BILL NEGOTIATORS TO MEET ON HOW TO ADVANCE THE LEGISLATION BEFORE MIDTERMS



But a Louisville law required Chelsey to create photographs and write blog posts celebrating same-sex weddings because she celebrates weddings between a man and woman. Running her business consistent with her beliefs means the city could slap her with investigations, damages, and court orders. Hard to run a business or support a growing family like that.

This went beyond economics, though. While Chelsey developed a love for photography at a young age, she’s primarily focused on weddings. Not only are weddings beautiful and joy-filled events, they signal the beginning of a profound and sacred commitment. Like so many others, Chelsey believes in God’s design for marriage, so she uses her role as photographer to celebrate that idea. Louisville’s law tried to force her to forsake her faith and promote something she doesn’t believe in — to amplify the government-approved view of marriage rather than her own.



That’s where this story transcends even the important topic of marriage. The government shouldn’t be forcing any artist to speak any message they disagree with, whether about marriage or anything else. That basic freedom protects the LGBT graphic artist who doesn’t want to create websites condemning same-sex marriage, the Democrat artist who doesn’t want to create posters promoting the Republican platform, and the Muslim calligrapher who doesn’t want to write flyers promoting Christianity. If the First Amendment protects them, shouldn’t it protect Chelsey, too?





Armed with that common sense, Chelsey, through her attorneys with Alliance Defending Freedom, challenged Louisville’s law, and she recently won big. A federal district court ruled that the city violated the First Amendment when threatening to force her to violate her conscience.



As that court wrote, ""the government may not force singers or writers or photographers to articulate messages they don't support. Because speech is categorically different under the federal Constitution, local laws must treat it differently, too."" After all, ""The freedom of speech—especially for minority views—is a core premise of our democratic republic.""

The court got it right. The government shouldn’t be in the business of imposing its orthodoxy on its citizens and silencing those who disagree. You don’t leave your right to free speech behind when you choose to make a living for your family, and Chelsey — like all Americans — should be free to express her beliefs — even if the government disagrees with them.



But Chelsey is not the only wife and mom who needs to teach a class in constitutional law to certain government bureaucrats.

This fall, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear 303 Creative v. Elenis, a nearly identical case that involves a graphic artist named Lorie Smith. Lorie wants the same freedom as Chelsey — to create art and websites consistent with the core of who she is. But, much like Louisville, Colorado officials are forcing Lorie to create websites promoting ideas about marriage that violate her faith. Once again, the issue is whether free speech protects each of us or whether government officials get to dictate what people can say and create.



Let’s hope that Chelsey’s case is a ""coming attraction"" for officials across the country trying to coercively push their agendas rather than protect the freedom of all Americans. Sometimes it takes the courage of those like Chelsey and Lorie to remind officials of basic lessons like these.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/supreme-court-could-echo-photographer-free-speech-victory-mandated-lgbt-support,N/A
"TODD'S AMERICAN DISPATCH: Christian bakery closes after LGBT threats, protests","A family-owned Christian bakery, under investigation for refusing to bake a wedding cake for a lesbian couple, has been forced to close its doors after a vicious boycott by militant homosexual activists.



Sweet Cakes By Melissa posted a message on its Facebook page alerting customers that their Gresham, Ore. retail store would be shut down after months of harassment from pro-gay marriage forces.



“Better is a poor man who walks in integrity than a rich man who is crooked in his ways,” read a posting from Proverbs on the bakery’s Facebook page.

[pullquote]

“It’s a sad day for Christian business owners and it’s a sad day for the First Amendment,” owner Aaron Klein told me. “The LGBT attacks are the reason we are shutting down the shop. They have killed our business through mob tactics.”



Last January, Aaron and Melissa Klein made national headlines when they refused to bake a wedding cake for a lesbian couple.



Klein tells me he has nothing against homosexuals -- but because of their religious faith, the family simply cannot take part in gay wedding events.



“I believe marriage is between a man and a woman,” he said. “I don’t want to help somebody celebrate a commitment to a lifetime of sin.”



The lesbian couple filed a discrimination with the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries and told their story to local newspapers and television statements.



Within days, militant homosexuals groups launched protests and boycotts. Klein told me he received messages threatening to kill his family. They hoped his children would die.



The LGBT protestors then turned on other wedding vendors around the community. They threatened to boycott any florists, wedding planners or other vendors that did business with Sweet Cakes By Melissa.



“That tipped the scales,” Klein said. “The LGBT activists inundated them with phone calls and threatened them. They would tell our vendors, ‘If you don’t stop doing business with Sweet Cakes By Melissa, we will shut you down.’”



To make matters worse, the Oregon’s Bureau of Labor and Industries announced last month they had launched a formal discrimination investigation against the Christian family.



Commissioner Brad Avakian told The Oregonian that he was committed to a fair and thorough investigation to determine whether the bakery discriminated against the lesbians.



“Everybody is entitled to their own beliefs, but that doesn’t mean that folks have the right to discriminate,” he told the newspaper. “The goal is to rehabilitate. For those who do violate the law, we want them to learn from that experience and have a good, successful business in Oregon.”



In other words, Christians who live and work in Oregon must follow man’s law instead of God’s law. But in a show of benevolence, the state is willing to rehabilitate and reeducate Christian business owners like the Kleins.



Klein said the closing of their retail store was a small price to pay for standing up for their religious beliefs.



“As a man of faith, I am in good spirits,” he said. “I’m happy to be serving the Lord and standing up for what’s right.”



Klein said what’s happened to Sweet Cakes By Melissa should be a warning to other Christians across the nation.



“This is a fight that’s been coming for a while,” he said. “Be prepared to take a stand. Hopefully, the church will wake up and understand that we are under attack right now.”



Just last month, New Mexico’s Supreme Court ruled that two Christian photographers who declined to photograph a same-sex union violated the state’s Human Rights Act. One justice said the photographers were “compelled by law to compromise the very religious beliefs that inspire their lives.”



Denver baker Jack Phillips is facing possible jail time for refusing to bake a cake for a gay wedding.



The Colorado Attorney General’s office filed a formal complaint against Phillips, the owner of Masterpiece Cake Shop. A hearing before the state’s civil rights commission is set for later this month.



In Indianapolis, a family-owned cookie shop faced a discrimination investigation after they refused to make rainbow cookies for National Coming Out Day.



A T-shirt company in Lexington, Ky. found itself at the center of a Human Rights Commission investigation after they refused to make T-shirts for a local gay rights organization.



Klein said it’s becoming clear that Christians do not have the “right to believe what we believe.”



In other words, gay rights trump religious rights.



Aaron and Melissa Klein tell me they will continue to bake wedding cakes from their home. He’s already taken a full-time job to pay the bills and feed their five children.



Mrs. Klein told television station KPTV her philosophy remains unchanged by recent events.



“The Bible tells us to flee from sin,” she said. “I don’t think making a cake for it helps. I guess in my mind I thought we lived in a lot nicer of a world where everybody tolerated everybody.”



The plight of the Klein family exposes the true nature of the left. Those who preach tolerance and diversity are the least tolerant and the least diverse of all.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/todds-american-dispatch-christian-bakery-closes-after-lgbt-threats-protests,N/A
"California bans state travel to Texas, 3 other states over anti-LGBT laws","California's attorney general blocked state-funded travel to Texas and three other states on Thursday in response to what he considers anti-LGBT rights laws enacted this year.

Democratic Attorney General Xavier Becerra added Texas, Alabama, South Dakota and Kentucky to the list of places where state employee travel is restricted. Lawmakers passed legislation last year banning non-essential travel to states with laws that discriminate against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. North Carolina, Kansas, Mississippi and Tennessee are already on the list.

California taxpayers' money ""will not be used to let people travel to states who chose to discriminate,"" Becerra said.

It's unclear what practical effect California's travel ban will have. The state law contains exemptions for some trips, such as travel needed to enforce California law and to honor contracts made before 2017. Travel to conferences or out-of-state trainings are examples of trips that could be blocked. Becerra's office couldn't provide information about how often state employees have visited the newly banned states.

Texas was added to the list because of a law that lets child welfare organizations deny services and adoptions to families because of ""sincerely held religious beliefs"" that Becerra's office says would allow LGBT discrimination. Similar laws were enacted in Alabama and South Dakota. Kentucky's new law could allow LGBT discrimination in schools, according to Becerra's office.

""California may be able to stop their state employees, but they can't stop all the businesses that are fleeing over taxation and regulation and relocating to Texas,"" said John Wittman, a spokesman for Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican.

Fresno State, a public California university, is scheduled to play football against the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa this fall. A request for a legal opinion on whether public university sports' travel is exempt from the ban has been filed with Becerra's office, but no ruling has been issued.

California beach town will no longer fly LGBT pride flag outside city hall; 'We are one' city says councilman,"A California beach community has reversed a decision to fly the gay pride flag in front of government buildings and will now only allow a select group of flags to be flown.

In a 4-3 party line vote, the city council in Huntington Beach, California voted to advance a proposal that would no longer allow the gay pride flag to be flown in front of government buildings, KTLA 5 reported .

The move comes roughly two years after the city council unanimously voted in 2021 to fly the gay pride flag in front of city hall during gay pride month.

According to the proposal, which did not specifically mention the LGBT flag, the only flags that may be flown in front of city government buildings are the U.S. flag, the California state flag, the city flag, the county flag, the POW/MIA flag and flags representing the six branches of the military.

REPORTERS FACE JAIL FOR INTERVIEWING CHRISTIAN WHO LEFT LGBT LIFESTYLE, WARN OF ASSAULT ON FREE SPEECH

Several residents voiced opposition to the move at a city council meeting on Tuesday including former Huntington Beach Mayor Connie Boardman, who said flying the gay pride flag is a ""small gesture that recognizes the value of our residents and visitor who belong to the LGBTQ+ community.""

""Huntington Beach is inclusive. The notion that we need a flag to say that is absurd.""

Newly elected Republican Councilmember Pat Burns, who introduced the proposal, suggested that the move will unite people more than it divides and is aimed at eliminating ""divisive titling"", NBC 4 Los Angeles reported on Wednesday.

DEMOCRAT BLAMES GOP FOR FANNING THE ‘FLAMES OF BIGOTRY’ AGAINST LGBT PEOPLE

""It has nothing to do with segregating or being anything else to another group,"" Burns said. ""It has nothing to do with that. It’s recognizing we are one.""

Democrat Councilmember Rhonda Bolton disagreed.

""The fact that we have symbols that have a special meaning to certain segments of the community does not mean that other segments of the community are excluded,"" Bolton said.

Huntington Beach, a town of about 200,000 people roughly 40 miles south of Los Angeles, sits in Orange County, California, which was historically a Republican stronghold but has shifted left in recent years including in 2020 when the county supported President Biden by almost 10 points.

California bill to end alleged LGBT discrimination on sex offender list stirs controversy,"A new state bill in California that seeks to change the way some convicted criminals are put on the sex offender registry list is sparking controversy, with some Republicans in the Golden State claiming it would shield sexual predators.

The goal of the legislation, according to California state Sen. Scott Wiener, is to bring parity to the laws governing who has to register as a sex offender in the state and to end discrimination in the courts against LGBT people.

The current law states that while consensual sex between a 15- to 17-year-old and a partner within 10 years of age is illegal, if the pair is having vaginal intercourse, a judge will decide if the accused has to register as a sex offender. Other forms of sex automatically require someone to register as a sex offender.

HOW A MINOR CHANGE IN CALIFORNIA'S ELECTION LAW MAY HAVE DOOMED REPUBLICANS' CHANCES

The law is based on a California Supreme Court ruling that says it is not discriminatory to treat vaginal intercourse and other forms of sex differently and for harsher penalties to be implemented for the latter because the former can cause pregnancy while the others cannot.

The California lawmaker's office said that the law would result in the equal treatment of straight and LGBT young people and end the discrimination against young LGBT people engaged in consensual sexual activity.

""The judge would have discretion in these cases as to whether or not to place someone on the sex offender registry,"" Victor Ruiz-Cornejo, Wiener's communication's director, said in an email to Fox News. ""While it is most often LGBT young people that are impacted, the bill itself brings parity to the way we treat sexual acts.""

ANALYSIS: CALIFORNIA POLITICS WILL GET CRAZY IN 2019. WHAT'S THE SILVER LINING FOR THE GOP?

Republican lawmakers in California have come out strongly against the legislation – saying that the bill would allow sexual predators to lure minors to have sex with them without fear of having to register as a sex offender if caught.

“The language of the bill states that if a predator is not more than 10 years older than the minor, he or she would have an opportunity to avoid registering as a sex offender,” Republican state Sen. Mike Morrell said in a statement to Fox News. “This proposed legislation would place our children at risk. The bill is wrong and it is immoral.”

In a press release, the California State Senate Republican Caucus claims that, if the bill is passed, “a 25-year-old luring a 15-year-old, a 22-year-old luring a 12-year-old, or an 19-year-old luring a 9-year-old would be shielded under the proposed legislation.”

Sponsors and supporters of the bill contest this argument, saying that the bill still maintains the provision that anyone convicted of a sexual act with a child 14 years old or younger automatically must register as a sex offender. Instead, they argue that the bill is meant to protect LGBT people in consensual sexual relationships.

""There's no reason for the law to treat a high school senior dating a high school junior differently because of their sexual orientation or gender identity,"" Rick Zbur, the executive director of equality California, said in a statement. ""For years, we've been working to make this common-sense fix and ensure LGBTQ young people are treated the same as their peers.""",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/california-bill-to-end-lgbt-discrimination-stirs-controversy-as-republicans-say-it-protects-sexual-predators,N/A
California legislature now 10% LGBT,"While LGBTQ candidates and their supporters celebrated several milestone victories around the nation in this year's midterm elections, California quietly reached its own: At least 10% of its state lawmakers identify publicly as LGBTQ, believed to be a first for any U.S. legislature.

The California legislators, all Democrats, are proud of their success but say it underscores the hard work that remains in their own state and elsewhere, such as handling the fallout from measures such as Florida’s ""Don’t Say Gay"" law, which bans some lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity, or laws in other states limiting transgender students’ participation in sports or blocking gender-affirming medical care for youths.

The milestone was further shrouded by the Saturday night shooting at a gay nightclub in Colorado, which killed five people and wounded many others. The suspect was charged with murder and hate crimes. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, who just won a second term, was the first openly gay man elected as a state's governor when he won in 2018.

MASSACHUSETTS' MAURA HEALEY BECOMES FIRST LESBIAN ELECTED GOVERNOR IN US

""When it comes to LGBTQ people, we're on two tracks: One track is that societally we're winning. People by and large are totally fine with LGBTQ people, they support us, they are accepting and willing to vote for LGBTQ candidates,"" California state Sen. Scott Wiener, a member of the LGBTQ Caucus, said Monday.

Yet, he said, ""despite the fact that we are winning the battle in society at large, you have a very vocal, dangerous minority of extremists who are consistently attacking and demonizing our community.""

At least 519 out LGBTQ candidates won elected office this year, in positions ranging from school board up to Congress and governor, said LGBTQ Victory Fund press secretary Albert Fujii. That’s a record, well up from 2020, when 336 LGBTQ candidates won, according to the group, which along with Equality California calculated that California is the first state to pass the 10% threshold.

Of the 12 current or soon-to-be members of the California Legislature, eight were already part of its LGBTQ Caucus, including the leader of the Senate and three other senators whose terms run until 2024. Four current Assembly members won reelection Nov. 8, with two new Assembly members and two new senators joining them, increasing the caucus’s ranks by 50%. The AP has not yet called one remaining race that could add an additional LGBTQ lawmaker.

The lawmakers will be sworn in for their new terms Dec. 5; between both chambers there are 120 total legislators.

The U.S. census has found that 9.1% of Californians identified as LGBT — compared with 7.9% for the nation overall — so the Legislature will have roughly reached parity in sexual orientation and gender identity. Meanwhile, the Legislature has not yet reached parity in gender or in race and ethnicity, according to statistics from the California State Library.

New Hampshire and Vermont have each had more LGBTQ legislators, according to the institute, but their legislatures are bigger than California’s and so have not reached the 10% threshold.

The 2022 elections are a landscape of firsts for LGBTQ people, including Corey Jackson, the California Legislature's first gay Black man, who noted that African Americans — particularly Black trans people — are especially marginalized.

""I think this is an opportunity just to say that number one, we are here, we do have something to contribute and we can lead and represent with the best of them,"" said Jackson, a school board member from Riverside County.

Alaska and South Dakota elected their first out LGBTQ legislators, and Montana and Minnesota elected their first transgender legislators, according to the Human Rights Campaign. In New Hampshire, Democrat James Roesener, 26, became the first trans man elected to any U.S. state legislature.

He said he was motivated to run after a state bill that would have required schools to notify parents of developments in their children's gender identity and expression failed only narrowly. Opponents of such requirements say they invade children’s privacy and can put them at risk of abuse at home.

Leigh Finke, who was elected in Minnesota, also was driven by growing anti-transgender rhetoric.

Finke hopes to ban so-called conversion therapy in Minnesota and, like California, make the state a sanctuary for children, and their parents, who can't access gender-affirming health care elsewhere.

""I just thought, ‘This can’t stand.’ We have to have trans people in these rooms. If we are going to lose our rights, at least they have to look us in the eye when they do it,"" she said.

Massachusetts and Oregon elected the nation’s first out lesbian governors.

Charlotte Perri, a 23-year-old voting organizer in Portland, Oregon, said she got emotional hearing Gov.-elect Tina Kotek talk at a campaign event about young people thanking her for running.

""It’s hard to feel optimistic as a young queer person with everything that’s going on,"" Perri said.

Though the newly elected LGBTQ officials are overwhelmingly Democrats, at least one gay Republican — George Santos, a supporter of former President Donald Trump — won a U.S. House seat in New York by defeating another gay man, a Democrat.

The increase in LGBTQ lawmakers contrasts with efforts in some states led by members of Santos' party to limit the influence, visibility and rights of LGBTQ people.

LGBT CONSERVATIVES DON'T BUY INTO THE WOKE LEFT’S RADICAL VIEW THAT SEX AND GENDER ARE MEANINGLESS

In Tennessee, leaders of the state’s Republican legislative supermajority said the first bill of the 2023 session will seek to ban gender-affirming care for minors. Tennessee has one LGTBQ lawmaker, Democratic Rep. Torrey Harris.

The state already has banned transgender athletes from participating in girls middle and high school sports and restricted which bathrooms transgender students and employees can use.

The Human Rights Campaign tracked what it identified as anti-LGTBQ bills introduced in 23 states this year and said they became law in 13: Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Indiana, Kentucky, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah and Louisiana.

By contrast, ""as California’s Legislative LGBTQ Caucus has grown, the state has led the nation in passing groundbreaking legislation protecting LGBTQ+ civil rights,"" said Equality California spokesperson Samuel Garrett-Pate.

Wiener carried California's sanctuary bill for transgender youths, which has been copied by Democratic lawmakers in other states. He and a fellow Assembly member teamed up in 2019 to expand access to HIV prevention medication. Other laws pushed by LGBTQ legislators over the years gave foster children rights to gender-affirming care and allowed nonbinary gender markers on state identification.

It's too soon to have a solid plan for new legislation, California caucus members said, but Wiener noted realms to consider include employment resources for transgender people; homelessness and crime among at-risk LGTBQ youth; and sexual health services.

Cori Bush accuses Republican lawmakers of 'White supremacy' in LGBT hearing,"Rep. Cori Bush, D-Mo., appeared to accuse her Republican colleagues of spreading ""White supremacy"" during a congressional hearing Wednesday on anti-LGBT hate crimes.

The House Oversight and Reform Committee heard from witnesses, including victims of the Club Q and Pulse Nightclub shootings, as well as activists within the LGBT community and crime experts. Bush took the mic after several hours of testimony and appeared to attack her Republican colleagues.

Maloney, who lost her primary contest earlier this year, said Republican attempts at the state level to ban transgender treatments for minors, and ban gender identity lessons in public elementary schools, have led to instances of violence against LGBT people.

""These actions are the culmination of years of anti-LGBT extremism that began in statehouses across the country and spread to social media platforms before boiling over to the communities we reside,"" Maloney said.

“Please tell me we don’t have anything to fear,” callers continually asked Log Cabin Republicans leader Gregory Angelo.

Given the media coverage that’s greeted Trump’s victory a week ago, it’s not too difficult to see where the worries originate: The New York Times wrote about the billionaire’s election as “a devastating loss” for the gay community; Mother Jones ran a piece on rising calls to LGBT suicide prevention hotlines; Senate Minority Leader Democrat Harry Reid issued a statement Friday citing accounts of “gay and lesbian couples having slurs hurled at them and feeling afraid to walk down the street holding hands.”

But gay conservative leaders like Angelo suggest that level of alarm doesn’t seem to square with the rhetoric and actions emanating from Trump and his campaign.

BARRON: TRUMP WILL BE FRIEND, ADVOCATE FOR LGBT COMMUNITY

Aside from Thiel’s well-received convention speech, the Silicon Valley billionaire was named to the executive committee of Trump’s presidential transition team. Ric Grenell, a former diplomat and a Fox News contributor, reportedly is on the short list to be U.S. ambassador to the U.N. – which would make him the first openly gay person to serve in that role.

Trump said in April that transgender individuals should “use the bathroom that they feel is appropriate,” and he counts transgender celeb Caitlyn Jenner as a supporter. In a ""60 Minutes"" interview Sunday, Trump declared the issue of marriage equality to be “settled.”

“These do not sound like the words of someone who the LGBTQ community should be fearful of,” Angelo told FoxNews.com. “I don’t believe we’ve ever had a president who has so explicitly made overtures to the LGBTQ community. That’s unprecedented.”

One of Trump’s most noteworthy outreach efforts came July 21 at the Republican National Convention, in the aftermath of the June terrorist attack on Florida gay nightclub Pulse. Delivering his nomination acceptance speech, Trump assured those listening, “As your president I will do everything in my power to protect LGBTQ citizens.”

The convention crowd cheered at the line, prompting Trump to deliver an off-script aside: “I must say, as a Republican it’s so nice to hear you cheering for what I just said.”

Such remarks were a break from traditional Republican rhetoric.

“Donald Trump won, not because he campaigned on social issues, but essentially because he campaigned on everything but social issues,” Angelo said. “Gone are the days where an exclusive focus on social issues is the crown jewel of a Republican presidential campaign.”

Critics – and even those willing to give Trump a chance, like Angelo – do have lingering gripes with Trump and his party, however, on gay rights issues.

Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who’s expected to wield a great deal of power and currently is leading the transition team, has long been a target of LGBT activists. As Indiana governor, Pence signed a religious freedom law that was strongly opposed by the LGBT community, and it was only after significant criticism that Pence signed an amendment to protect gays and lesbians. Pence has previously supported a constitutional amendment to define marriage as being between a man and a woman, opposed an employment non-discrimination act, opposed the repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” and has stood against allowing transgender individuals to use the bathroom of the gender they associate with.

The official platform of Trump’s party, too, is opposed to same-sex marriage and transgender bathroom laws.

But despite the sometimes conflicting agendas, Angelo sees opportunity.

“What you’re seeing, if you look big picture, is an effort to bring together not just wings of the GOP, but parts of America that were traditionally viewed as incompatible,” Angelo said. “That’s something that makes me very optimistic.”

Before the election, Grenell wrote in The Washington Times: ""No other Republican Presidential nominee in history has embraced the LGBT community in such a loud and proud way.""",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dems-media-skewing-trumps-record-on-lgbt-issues,N/A
Dems under fire after ties to lawmaker who wants to criminalize parents who don’t affirm LGBT kids exposed,"Democratic representatives seeking re-election this fall in Virginia remain silent after cozying up with a delegate in the state legislature whose new bill would make it a punishable crime for parents not to affirm their LGBT children.

On Thursday, Delegate Elizabeth Guzman told WJLA that at the start of the new legislative session, she will introduce a bill that would penalize, with a misdemeanor or felony charge, parents who do not affirm their LGBT children. The bill would expand the state's definition of child abuse and neglect to include parents who do not affirm their LGBT children's gender identity or sexual orientation.

""Well, we first have to complete an investigation,"" Guzman told WJLA about the new bill. ""It could be a felony, it could be a misdemeanor, but we know that [Child Protective Services] charge could harm your employment, could harm their education, because nowadays, many people do a CPS database search before offering employment.""

Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Va., who is running in a tight House race, recently accepted an endorsement from Guzman in July for her re-election campaign. ""@guzman4virginia is a tireless leader in the Virginia House of Delegates. I am proud to have Delegate Guzman’s support for my campaign,"" she wrote in a Twitter post.

VIRGINIA STATE LAWMAKER TO INTRODUCE BILL MAKING IT A CRIME FOR PARENTS TO NOT AFFIRM THEIR LGBT CHILD

Spanberger and Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., were recently photographed with Guzman during a routable discussion on Tuesday morning and attended an early-voting event at the Prince William Country DMV that afternoon.

Former senior Department of Justice official and parental rights activist Ian Prior called out Spanberger for her ties to Guzman on twitter.

Fox News Digital reached out to Rep. Spanberger, asking whether she would pull her endorsement from Guzman and whether she, too, believed it was a crime for a parent not to affirm their LGBT child. Spanberger did not immediately respond.

VIRGINIA'S YOUNGKIN DEFENDS TRANS YOUTH POLICIES: KIDS ‘DON’T BELONG TO THE STATE'

Another Democrat seeking re-election this fall, Rep. Jennifer Wexton, D-Va., is linked to Guzman after endorsing her this cycle for the House of Delegates. Wexton also did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment asking whether she would disavow her endorsement for Guzman.

Guzman's proposal to criminalize parents who don't affirm their LGBT children came after Gov. Glenn Youngkin, R-Va., introduced new policies that would require students to use bathrooms and join sports teams based on their biological sex rather than their gender identity.

""The day that Governor Youngkin wanted to implement this policy, I immediately texted the policy lead of that committee and said, this is how we're going to push back,"" Guzman said during her interview.

Spanberger joined ""The Politics Hour"" with Kojo Nnamdi Friday and voiced her disagreement with Youngkin's policies. ""I think it's unfortunate that adults may want to punch down"" on LGBTQ kids. ""It's a pretty sad state of affairs,"" she said.

Youngkin defended his new policies during an interview Sunday with CNN's Jake Tapper.

""Let me begin with these basic principles, which is, first, parents have a fundamental right to be engaged in their children's lives. And, oh, by the way, children have a right to have parents engaged in their lives. We needed to fix a wrong,"" Youngkin told Tapper. ""The previous administration had had a policy that excluded parents and in fact, particularly didn't require the involvement of parents. And let's be clear: parents have this right, and children don't belong to the state, they belong to families.""

Detransitioning TikToker was 'horrified' after LGBT activist claimed ‘detransitioning’ is not ‘a real thing’,"EXCLUSIVE: Oli London, a TikTok influencer who recently detransitioned after identifying as transgender, was ""horrified"" after a LGBT activist said during a congressional hearing last week that ""detransitioning"" is not ""a real thing.""

On Wednesday, LGBT activist Jessie Pocock was asked about individuals who decide to detransition.

""I've just never heard of a case of anyone detransitioning, so I honestly don't think it's a real thing,"" Pocock told Rep. Michael Cloud, R-Texas, during the hearing.

During an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital, London said this type of rhetoric not only denies the stories of people like himself but also contributes to the hatred and bullying of those who regretted their attempts to change gender.

LGBT ADVOCATE CLAIMS IN HOUSE HEARING ‘DETRANSITIONING’ IS NOT ‘A REAL THING’

""You know, there's thousands and thousands of kids that have gone through these horrifying gender surgeries. And in places like Oregon, 15-year-olds can have these genital reassignment surgeries without the consent of their parents. I mean, that is absolutely horrifying,"" London said after watching the hearing.

""Whatever people agree on — trans issues, LGBT — these are kids. You know, the fact that a kid can go behind their parents that can do this is absolutely shocking. And Cloud was just trying to highlight that there are kids out there, and they need their voices heard, and they shouldn't be silenced.""

""Now, she's (Pocock) a very prominent LGBT activist, head of an organization speaking before the House Oversight Committee. So, she obviously has a lot of influence and power. She was saying that these people do not even exist. People like me don't exist,"" London told Fox News Digital.

DETRANSITIONING NAVY SEAL SPEAKS OUT, WARNS AGAINST CHILDREN RUSHING INTO TREATMENT

Pocock is the CEO of Inside Out Youth Services, a group that claims to support ""lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex, asexual, queer, questioning and two-spirit (LGBTQIA2+) youth"" in El Paso County, Colorado.

""People like these 18-year-olds that have had their bodies altered in unnatural ways, and now they live to regret it. She is saying they don't exist. And, you know, this was a committee meeting about combating violence against LGBT people. Well, I have to say, people like this woman are the reason why people that detransition get hate,"" said London, who has openly shared his detransition journey on TikTok to spread awareness over the decision.

""They get bullied. They get abuse because people like her in a position of power that say these people don't exist. You know, that shows that these people don't care about detransition. They don't care about it. They just care about the dream being sold that everyone who is trans is happy. And it's simply not the case,"" he added.

GOP governor condemns LGBT provisions in state party platform: 'Hurtful and divisive',"North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, a Republican, took to Twitter on Thursday to condemn certain provisions in the state Republican Party's platform that made highly controversial claims about LGBT issues.

The statements were included in a resolution on the party's opposition to ""Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Anti-Discrimination"" (SOGI) bills.

The platform was approved by a mail-in vote in April and addressed a wide array of issues, not just those related to the party's position on the LBGT movement. But many, in addition to the governor, objected to those lines.

US DISTRICT COURT ORDERS DAKOTA ACCESS PIPELINE SHUT DOWN, EMPTIED

""As I’ve long said, all North Dakotans deserve to be treated equally and live free of discrimination. There’s no place for the hurtful and divisive rhetoric in the NDGOP resolutions,"" Burgum said. ""We can respect one another’s freedoms without disrespecting or discriminating against the LGBT members of our state and our party, whom we support.""

The resolution was meant to show the party's opposition to adding sexual orientation or gender identity to protected classes like race -- a generally standard position among Republicans nationwide. It also included noncontroversial statements like the party is against discrimination from a place of ""hatred."" Further, it noted some versions of SOGI bills ""criminalize not using certain preferred pronouns."" But there were a number of other declarations in the resolution that caused uproar.

One line read that ""[m]any LGBT practices are unhealthy and dangerous, sometimes endangering or shortening life and sometimes infecting society at large.""

SUPREME COURT RULES GAY WORKERS PROTECTED FROM JOB DISCRIMINATION, IN BIG WIN FOR LGBT RIGHTS

Another read: ""[R]esearch has shown that causes of Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender (LGBT) compulsions are primarily developmental and not genetic as in color and gender.""

""SOGI bills seek to pacify those made uncomfortable as a result of their gender dysphoria,"" yet another said, ""by compromising the potential comfort and safety of an untold number of innocent individuals.""

A separate line warned that SOGI laws could ""empower"" gay or transgender people ""to assume positions of mentorships of minors often over objections of parents influencing their emotions and thereby recruiting for their lifestyles.""

""The @NDGOP thinks NoDakotans like me are only interested in recruiting young people to a lifestyle, protecting bathroom voyeurs & infecting society,"" Joshua Boschee, the North Dakota House Minority Leader, said in a tweet Wednesday. ""Is this how my legislative colleagues feel? Is this how Gov. @DougBurgum feels? If not, then say something & do something about it!""

Burgum sent out his tweet just hours after Boschee's message, and Boschee thanked ""the @NDGOP lawmakers who have started to speak out against this disgusting language within your party's platform.""

North Dakota's Democratic Party said the resolution was ""troubling but not surprising,"" in a statement reported by KX News.

The North Dakota American Civil Liberties Union also weighed in.

""If these policies don't actually reflect North Dakota, then what are constituents of all political parties doing to fix this and address the state of inclusivity for LGBTQ+ and Two Spirit folks?"" the organization said in a tweet.

The state GOP's executive director, Corby Kemmer, issued a statement Wednesday apologizing for the language in that resolution, which was first reported on by The Forum of Fargo-Moorhead on Wednesday.

“The resolutions were presented for an up or down vote, and no one resolution was voted on individually,” Kemmer said.

He continued that the delegates wanted ""to stand up for individual and religious liberties"" but that ""this language falls woefully short of that goal.""

Kemmer said that the resolution would be reconsidered in a ""future meeting.""

House Republicans scuttle spending bill over LGBT provision,"Conservatives angered by the inclusion of LGBT protections in an otherwise routine spending bill scuttled the measure Thursday, a stark display of the potency of a civil rights issue suddenly prominent in the presidential race and responsible for a legal standoff between the Obama administration and several states.

The sweeping 305-112 vote to kill an energy spending measure imperils efforts by GOP leaders to pass any more of the 12 annual spending bills for the upcoming budget year.

The implosion came after Democrats managed late Wednesday to add an amendment protecting lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people against discrimination by federal contractors. The provision, which passed on a 223-195 vote, was aimed aimed at upholding an Obama administration executive order.

That provision prompted more than half of House Republicans to vote against the bill's passage on Thursday.

Meanwhile, Democrats overwhelmingly opposed the bill over a GOP provision they said defends North Carolina's transgender bathroom law, which also takes away a variety of federal protections for LGBT people.

The Obama administration has filed suit against the law and has threatened to take away federal funding for the state, and Republicans muscled through a provision to ensure that federal dollars are not taken away.

The hostility from both tea party lawmakers and Democrats could scuttle the entire appropriations process, just as a controversy over the Confederate flag sank the process last year.

""House Republicans' thirst to discriminate against the LGBT community is so strong that they are willing to vote down their own appropriations bill in order to prevent progress over bigotry,"" said minority leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. ""In turning against a far-reaching funding bill simply because it affirms protections for LGBT Americans, Republicans have once again lain bare the depths of their bigotry.""

But it was Pelosi who led a charge by Democrats against a provision to protect North Carolina from retaliation by several federal agencies over the law requiring transgender people to use the bathroom of their original sex. That provision was approved late Wednesday on a 227-192 vote.

Moments after the bill failed, Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., blamed the outcome on Democrats, even though a majority of Republicans voted against the bill. He also said it was also a result of the more open procedures he's instituted in the House.

""Early on I stood up here ... and said that some bills might fail because we're not going to tightly control the process and predetermine the outcome of everything around here. We'll, that's what happened here today,"" Ryan said.

""What we learned today is that the Democrats were not looking to advance an issue but to sabotage the appropriations process,"" he said.

He vowed to revive the bill and the overall appropriations process.

The amendment to protect North Carolina, authored Rep. Robert Pittenger, R-N.C., came in response to warnings from the Obama administration that it may take away federal money in response to the bathroom law.

""The president and his emissaries have stated ... that funds should not be dispensed to North Carolina until North Carolina is coerced into complying with the legal beliefs of the president and his political views,"" Pittenger said. ""This is an egregious abuse of executive power.""

The North Carolina law was passed after the city of Charlotte passed an ordinance allowing transgender people to use restrooms of their chosen gender identity. The state law went further to take away federal protections for gays, putting the state at risk of losing a variety of federal funds.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-republicans-scuttle-spending-bill-over-lgbt-provision,N/A
Illinois Senate passes bill that requires LGBT history in public schools,"The Illinois Senate passed a bill Wednesday that would require public schools in the state to teach lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) history, as well as use inclusive and “non-discriminatory” textbooks.

The bill, which passed with a 34-18 vote, would require “all elementary and high schools to teach a unit studying ‘the role and contributions of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people in the history of this country and this State,’” The Associated Press reported.

Supporters of the legislation, such as Democratic Sen. Heather Steans, who sponsored the measure, told Fox News that teaching LGBT history in schools is important to “increase compassion and understanding as well as to provide historical role models for LGBT students.""

“This measure is consistent with how Illinois public schools teach children about other marginalized communities and ethnicities, and it is one more step toward offering students a complete and accurate historical perspective,” she added.

The measure is not unlike the state's school code, which “already ensures inclusion in history curriculum of the contributions and experiences of other historically marginalized communities, including of people of color, women, immigrant communities and people with disabilities,” LGBT advocacy group Equality Illinois said in a statement.

However, how much time is spent on the subject would be left up to school districts to decide.

Opponents argue that the bill contradicts Judeo-Christian beliefs and have raised concerns regarding religious freedom.

""Schools should teach that we should be respectful of each student and each person. This is what we all agree on. However, schools should not be used to advocate for lifestyles that are against the religious values of the students and parents,” Illinois Family Institute lobbyist Ralph Rivera told legislators in a memo, according to The State Journal Register.

But Steans said she has “worked with opponents and have addressed their concerns about whether it is appropriate for children to learn about LGBT history and the implications for religious freedom.”

“This bill is about historical facts,” she added.

The measure will now head to the House, where Steans said she is “hopeful” it will pass. If enacted, Illinois would become the second state to approve an LGBT inclusive curriculum.

Joe Biden to LGBT gala: 'Hold President Trump accountable',"Former Vice President Joe Biden, warning of transgender Americans ""under attack"" in Republican-led states, on Wednesday challenged the nation's LGBT community to push back against President Donald Trump's administration.

""Hold President Trump accountable for his pledge to be your friend,"" Biden declared at a private LGBT gala hosted by the Democratic National Committee in New York. ""Just because you don't have Barack and me in the White House doesn't mean it's time to give up, keep quiet, stay on the sidelines.""

Trump vowed to protect the LGBT community during his campaign, but critics say he hasn't kept his word since taking office. The issue has earned relatively little notice in Washington as political leaders focus on health care, taxes and multiple investigations into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia.

The Trump administration in February lifted Obama-era federal guidelines that allowed transgender students to use school bathrooms and locker rooms matching their gender identities. LGBT advocates also note that Trump, breaking from the practice of Obama, declined to issue a formal proclamation in honor of Pride Month in June.

In a statement, the White House pushed back against critics of the Republican president.

""President Trump has been clear in his commitment to improving the lives of all Americans, including those in the LGBT community,"" White House spokeswoman Kelly Love said.

While Biden avoided lashing out at Trump directly, he condemned the president's political party and homophobic regimes around the world that promote policies such as ""corrective rape"" and ""conversion therapy"" on gay people.

""Transgender Americans are under attack from state legislatures from North Carolina to Texas,"" Biden added, citing legislation ""targeting young people, kids who are just trying to attend school.""

Proponents of bathroom laws in Republican-led states warn of safety concerns should students be allowed to select bathrooms or locker rooms that match their gender identities. In reversing the Obama-era policy, the Trump administration cited states' rights.

Biden has been increasingly politically active since leaving the White House.

The 74-year-old Democrat launched a political action committee earlier in the month, stoking speculation he may seek the presidency in 2020. He headlined a fundraiser for Florida Democrats on Saturday and met privately with allies of Republican Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor and presidential candidate, the weekend before.

Biden was introduced Wednesday by DNC finance chair Henry Munoz, having officiated Munoz's same-sex wedding last month.

Munoz described the environment created by the Trump administration as ""scary.""

""This moment has been injected with hate and separation and is the farthest away from equality we have ever stood in my lifetime,"" Munoz said.

Munoz was among at least four openly gay DNC leaders who attended Wednesday's gala. The committee's new CEO, Jess O'Connell, was among them.

""I got married about seven months ago to my wife,"" she said. ""I felt tremendous relief to have gotten married when we did after the results of the election. It is a scary time.""",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/joe-biden-to-lgbt-gala-hold-president-trump-accountable,N/A
LGBT advocate claims in House hearing ‘detransitioning’ is not ‘a real thing’,"An LGBT advocate claimed during a House of Representatives hearing that transgender people ""detransitioning"" is not ""a real thing.""

During Wednesday’s House Oversight Committee hearing on anti-LGBT violence, Jessie Pocock, the CEO and executive director of Inside Out Youth Services, made the claim in response to a question from Texas Rep. Michael Cloud, a Republican, about formerly transgender people who have detransitioned.

""I can’t really speak to individuals’ personal experience. You know, someone’s gender is just a really personal experience, but I can tell you, I’ve been in this work a long time, I know a lot of trans folks, close friends, family members,"" Pocock said.

""And I've just never heard of a case of anyone detransitioning, so I honestly don't think it's a real thing.""

DETRANSITIONING NAVY SEAL SPEAKS OUT, WARNS AGAINST CHILDREN RUSHING INTO TREATMENT

Cloud pushed back on Pocock’s claim, saying, ""There’s a number of cases in the news right now"" showing people detransitioning from being transgender.

""And the concern that parents have is we’ve all had awkward teen years where we’ve questioned things and existence and a lot of things. And the question is kids who are maybe making a permanent decision even without the input of their parents and making irreversible decisions,"" Cloud said.

""There’s some who’ve talked about they can’t have kids anymore, and they wish they could in a lot of cases. And I’m curious on how we’d work to protect kids. I wish we had more time because I think this is an important issue to get into, but thank you for being here.""

Inside Out Youth Services supports ""lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex, asexual, queer, questioning and two-spirit (LGBTQIA2+) youth"" in El Paso County, Colorado.

In its values that form an acronym for ""INSIDE OUT,"" the organization lists ""intersectionality,"" ""openness"" and ""engagement.""

Other values listed by the organization include ""dancing/dance,"" ""nourishment"" and ""unicorns.""

There have been many cases of formerly transgender individuals detransitioning back to their original genders, but often with permanent damage to their bodies.

Chloe Cole, an 18-year-old former transgender child who was on hormone blockers at 13 and had a double mastectomy at 15 before detransitioning a year later, offered to travel to Washington to ""clear up any confusion.""

""Detransitioners are pretty used to being told that they don’t exist,"" she tweeted Wednesday. ""I don’t mind coming to DC to clear up any confusion lol.""

Prisha Mosley, who is detransitioning after a double mastectomy at the age of 18, talked about her struggles in an interview with ""America Reports"" last week.

""One of the issues I have is the lack of identity,"" Mosley explained. ""And, on top of not having a lot of friends and having issues at home, when I found the trans community and found a new identity and was affirmed … that's what caused me to transition.""

Mosley cited her mental health condition and manipulation from therapists and doctors for her decision to transition at such a young age. She said her parents were also manipulated into supporting the gender change.

""I was manipulated not only by my trans peers, but by my gender specialist, the person who gave me my letter of recommendation in surgery. It was all sold as like a wonderful thing,"" she said.

""It wasn't like a medical condition that you needed to be treated that was sad or serious. It was like a fun thing like you're trans now and it's celebrated and you're wonderful and you're a hero and all of that. And, you know, that attention is what I was looking for.""

Additionally, a retired Navy SEAL who came out as transgender a decade ago before announcing his detransition in recent days spoke out to Fox News about the process and why children should not rush or be rushed into making a life-altering medical decision.

Chris Beck, who had for a time been known as Kristen Beck, told ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" Monday he is not at all political, nor is he opposed to or critical of transgender people. He told host Tucker Carlson he wants potential transitioners to ""slow down"" and for doctors to get a full grasp of what they are doing.

""The transgender [issue] originally started out as pretty basic and very rare. And now it's kind of morphed into an ideology,"" Beck said.

""And that's what I'm speaking out about: Thinking about the ideology, I'm not talking about the people. Now, there's a lot of transgender people out there; great folks. But the ideology as I'm talking about is becoming something where it's being pushed in schools, and young teenagers are having surgeries because it says they're transgender. It's an affirmation.""

Beck criticized the idea that doctors are in some places allowed to overrule parents and go forward with transitioning surgeries or pharmaceutical prescriptions, calling it a major problem.

He claimed psychology manuals have essentially ""gotten rid of"" terminology like ""gender dysphoria"" or placed the issue under the umbrella of mental health.

""And now, as soon as somebody goes in there and says [they want to be] transgender, you're basically labeled transgender, and they start pushing your surgery,"" Beck said. ""That's what I'm trying to stop because [there are] a lot of gay people out there who are transgender but not transgender in everything.""

"North Dakota considering ban on sexual, LGBT-centric library books","Books containing ""sexually explicit"" content — including depictions of sexual or gender identity — would be banned from North Dakota public libraries under legislation that state lawmakers began considering Tuesday.

The GOP-dominated state House Judiciary Committee heard arguments but did not take a vote on the measure, which applies to visual depictions of ""sexually explicit"" content and proposes up to 30 days imprisonment for librarians who refuse to remove the offending books.

The proposal comes amid a national wave of Republican-backed laws to ban books that feature LGBTQ subject matter — though usually those bills have been limited to school libraries, not public ones.

SD REPUBLICANS PUSH FOR TRANS PROCEDURE BAN ON YOUTH

Supporters of the bill said it would preserve children’s innocence and reduce their exposure to pornography.

But critics said the measure is ""steeped in discrimination"" and would allow government censorship of material that is not actually obscene.

House Majority Leader Mike Lefor, of Dickinson, introduced the bill and said public libraries currently contain books that have ""disturbing and disgusting"" content, including ones that describe virginity as a silly label and assert that gender is fluid.

Lefor argued that a child's exposure to such content has been associated with addiction, poor self esteem, devalued intimacy, increasing divorce rates, unprotected sex among young people and poor well-being — though did he did not offer any evidence to support such claims.

Stark County resident Autumn Richard also spoke in favor of the bill, giving examples of explicit content in the graphic novel ""Let’s Talk About It: The Teen’s Guide to Sex, Relationships, and Being a Human"" and the kids' comic book ""Sex Is a Funny Word"" — both available in public libraries.

Richard argued the books might have beneficial knowledge about contraceptives, body image and abusive relationships, but many sections provide information that she said was harmful for minors.

Though supporters of North Dakota's bill repeatedly called the sexual content ""obscene,"" opponents said the material in question is not actually considered legally obscene.

""Nearly 50 years ago, the (U.S.) Supreme Court set the high constitutional bar that defines obscenity,"" said Cody Schuler, an advocacy manager at the American Civil Liberties Union of North Dakota, who testified against the bill.

Obscenity is a narrow, well-defined category of unprotected speech that excludes any work with serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value, Schuler said. Few, if any, books have been deemed obscene, and the standard for restraining a library’s ability to distribute a book are even more stringent, Schuler added.

The definition of pornography is also subjective, opponents of the bill said.

Library Director Christine Kujawa at Bismarck Veterans Memorial Public Library said the library has a book with two little hamsters on the cover. At the end of the book, the hamsters get married, and they are both male.

""It's a cute book,"" Kujawa said — but it would be considered pornography under the bill because the book includes gender identity.

Facing criminal charges for keeping books on shelves is ""something I never thought I would have to consider during my career as a librarian,"" Kujawa added.

In addition to banning depictions of ""sexual identity"" and ""gender identity,"" the measure specifies 10 other things that library books cannot visually depict, including ""sexual intercourse,"" ""sexual preference"" and ""sexual perversion,"" — though it does not define any of those terms. The proposal does not apply to books that have ""serious artistic significance"" or ""materials used in science courses,"" among other exceptions.

NORTH DAKOTA SCHOOL DISTRICT RECRUITS FLORIDA TEACHERS UPSET WITH DESANTIS' PARENTAL RIGHTS LAW

The bill would allow prosecutors to charge any person who displays these materials at places that children visit with a class B misdemeanor. The maximum penalty is 30 days of imprisonment and a $1,500 fine.

The wave of attempted book banning and restrictions continues to intensify across the country, the American Library Association reported in September. Numbers for 2022 approached the previous year’s totals, which were the highest in decades. Bills to restrict mature content in school libraries became laws last year in Tennessee, Utah, Missouri, Florida and Oklahoma.

The most targeted books have included Maia Kobabe’s graphic memoir about sexual identity, ""Gender Queer,"" and Jonathan Evison’s ""Lawn Boy,"" a coming-of-age novel narrated by a young gay man, according to an April report.

Orlando massacre prompts some in LGBT community to come out -- for Trump,"The Orlando terror massacre has members of the LGBT community around the nation coming out – for Donald Trump and the Second Amendment.

Some among the reliable Democratic constituency were not persuaded by President Obama’s post-attack call for new gun control measures and renewed warning against painting Islam in a negative light.

Trump’s counter message that Americans – including those in the LGBT community - must protect themselves against the hatred of radical Muslims struck a chord with Stephen Zieman.

“I knew I had to fully support Trump because he called out the threat for what it was -- radical Islamic terrorism,” the 23-year-old from Schaumburg, Ill., told FoxNews.com. “He stood up for the LGBT community and called himself a friend. It's something we all needed and he was there — Hillary was not. She was making excuses for the religion and calling for gun control, which is not what I needed to hear.”

Zieman took to Twitter and announced that he was now voting for Trump. He was greeted by fellow supporters who welcomed him.

I never believed in Hillary

I wasn't always a Trump supporter

After yesterday, I'm all in for @realDonaldTrump! #GaysForTrump — Stephen Zieman (@StephenZieman) June 13, 2016

Zieman was not the only LGBT person impressed by Trump’s response to the tragedy and his intensified calls for the country to be tougher on extremism.

In Orlando, political activist and Trump supporter Randy Ross said he has been deluged with private messages on Facebook and his cell phone showing support for Trump.

“In the last three days, I would say there were no less than 50 requests to be added to our volunteer listing, but moreover, it’s been a gradual progression over the last few months,” he said, noting the influx was mostly gay men.

Ross came out as gay in 2002 in his 30s, but only switched his party affiliation to GOP a few years ago. As an outspoken Republican, he said people have both welcomed his beliefs as well as questioned them. When he visited the site of the shooting during a talk this week by outspoken gay Breitbart journalist Milo Yiannapolous, someone asked him, “Are you scared to be here?”

“I’m an openly gay man,” he said. “That in and of itself, as a Republican, to openly gay is not necessarily easy for a lot of people to understand. I’m not a one-voter issue. I’ve never been scared, not once, to be a gay man that’s openly supporting Donald Trump, but I could tell that was one of their fears.

“[Trump] has never come out and attacked the LGBT community,” he continued. “If you want your freedom to come together and to be protected, if you want all those things, he’s the right person to do that because I don’t believe that’s what we’re seeing on the Hillary Clinton side.”

On Twitter, Trump told his followers that he will fight for the LGBT community:

The support extends from Trump the candidate to his pro-Second Amendment message, renewing an old argument about whether the answer to gun crimes is fewer firearms in general, or more of them in the hands of law-abiding citizens who can respond to an attack.

Gay, pro-Second Amendment group the Pink Pistols saw its membership more than double to 3,500 in the days following the attack. Instead of calling for new gun control measures, Pink Pistols First Speaker Gwendolyn Patton repeated the gun rights mantra that more guns, not fewer, could have saved lives. She said groups going out for drinks should consider a “designated carrier” to pack heat and stay sober.

“It’s sad that we must consider such things, but when there are persons out there who mean us harm, we must find ways to protect ourselves within the law.” Patton said.

Gun stores have reported anecdotal evidence of a surge in gay people buyig firearms. Mike Smith, a firearms instructor in Colorado Springs, told Fox 31 he has witnessed the phenomenon first hand.

“I think right now because of what happened, people are looking for answers,” he told the station. “You walk into a gun shop and you expect to see people, frankly, who look like me. I think we forget we’re a country of all people, not just people who fit that predetermined mold.”

In California during the hours immediately following the Orlando attack, the LGBT community was shaken yet again by news that an armed man was arrested, possibly on his way to attack revelers at the Los Angeles Pride event. The suspect is now believed to be gay himself, and his motives remain unclear. But the incident coming so quickly on the heels of Orlando left the California LGBT community rattled.

“I went out Saturday night and when we saw the news in the morning, we’re just like, ‘Gosh, that could have been us,’” said Nestor Moto, vice president of the Log Cabin Republicans of Orange County. “On Sunday, someone tried to do that. It really hit us.”

Moto, 21, originally backed Chris Christie for the Republican presidential nomination. When the New Jersey governor dropped out in February, he turned his attention to Trump, especially when he spoke out against the North Carolina bathroom bill that would not allow transgender people to use the bathroom of their gender identity. He also noted past interviews with LGBT magazine The Advocate where he was in favor of gay rights.

Then, when Trump said the Orlando attack was the result of Islamic terrorism, Moto became even more excited about his campaign.

“I was very, very pleased with the fact that he finally said that Islamic terrorism is anti-gay, anti-women, anti-Jewish because we need to diagnose the problem in order to fix it and he’s the first one that has actively said that in a public forum like that,” he said. “It’s very refreshing to hear someone who isn’t afraid to say it like it is.”

Online, LGBT people are experiencing another “coming out” in sharing their support for Trump -- the hashtags #GaysForTrump and #ComeOut4Trump are accompanied by selfies and declarations of jumping on the Trump Train.

“Every single Donald Trump supporter, and they come from all political backgrounds, have been loving, supportive and encouraging. They said they will defend me, they will support me and they will stand with me against oppression and terror,” said Zieman of his experience switching his support.

Ross knows many if not most in the LGBT community will vote Democrat, but said Trump’s message is getting through.

“You are starting to see more and more gay people become comfortable with the idea that Trump might be a candidate that they need to pursue,” Ross said.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/orlando-massacre-prompts-some-in-lgbt-community-to-come-out-for-trump,N/A
Grenell joins RNC as senior adviser focused on LGBT voter outreach,"EXCLUSIVE: Former acting Director of National Intelligence Ambassador Richard Grenell has joined the Republican National Committee as a senior adviser focused on political outreach, specifically to LGBT voters, Fox News has learned.

An RNC official told Fox News that Grenell recently joined the GOP, after serving as the first openly gay U.S. Cabinet official in history.

GRENELL DECLASSIFIES SLEW OF RUSSIA PROBE FILES AS DNI

""As America's first openly-gay cabinet member, I can confidently say that President Trump has done more for gay and lesbian Americans than any other president, and it is not even close,"" Grenell said in a statement to Fox News.

Grenell went on to slam Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, saying that during his ""four decades in Washington, he consistently fought against marriage equality and even threatened to cut funding for schools who taught acceptance of homosexuality.""

""From President Trump's global campaign to decriminalize homosexuality to becoming the first president to support gay marriage on his first day in office, he has been a champion for our community and I am thrilled to be part of the fight to re-elect him for four more years,"" Grenell said.

Grenell served as U.S. ambassador to Germany from 2018 to 2020, as the presidential envoy for Kosovo-Serbia Negotiations, and as acting director of National Intelligence in 2020, where he declassified a slew of documents related to the Russia investigation.

Prior to joining the Trump administration, Grenell was a spokesman at the United Nations, and in 2012, briefly served as national security and foreign affairs spokesman for then-candidate Mitt Romney's presidential campaign. He was the first openly gay spokesman for a Republican presidential candidate.

GRENELL STEPPING DOWN AS AMBASSADOR TO GERMANY AFTER DNI STINT

Grenell, this week, was featured in a new ad for the Log Cabin Republicans, which claimed Trump ""made history for #LGBT Americans.""

Meanwhile, Grenell’s addition to the RNC comes after the party marked Pride Month in June by highlighting Trump’s speech at the United Nations calling on dozens of countries to decriminalize homosexuality, and “historic” LGBT appointments, like Grenell’s.

Earlier this week, Grenell participated in a Team Trump bus tour in Nevada. Grenell also tweeted this week, in response to Goodyear's equity policy, ""Would @goodyear allow employees to wear this hat?""

"Supreme Court rules gay workers protected from job discrimination, in big win for LGBT rights","The Supreme Court handed a big win to the LGBT community Monday, ruling in a 6-3 decision that an employer who fires a worker for being gay or transgender violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act -- which already protected people from employer sex discrimination, as well as discrimination based on race, color, religion or national origin.

The decision dealt with three cases. In one, Clayton County, Georgia employee Gerald Bostock was fired from his job as a child welfare advocate for conduct “unbecoming” a county employee soon after he joined a gay softball league. In another, New York skydiving instructor Donald Zarda was fired days after mentioning he was gay, and in a third, Michigan funeral home worker Aimee Stephens was fired after she told her employer that she would be identifying as a woman six years into her employment.

ROBERTS EMBRACES ROLE AS SUPREME COURT SWING JUSTICE, WITH LATEST CHURCH RULING

""Ours is a society of written laws. Judges are not free to overlook plain statutory commands on the strength of nothing more than suppositions about intentions or guesswork about expectations. In Title VII, Congress adopted broad language making it illegal for an employer to rely on an employee’s sex when deciding to fire that employee,"" said the court's opinion, written by Justice Neil Gorsuch.

""We do not hesitate to recognize today a necessary consequence of that legislative choice: An employer who fires an individual merely for being gay or transgender defies the law.""

In all three situations, the employers admitted that they fired the workers for being gay or transgender, but they argued that this did not violate Title VII. The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, which heard Bostock’s case, agreed with this view. The Second and Sixth Circuits, which heard Zarda’s and Stephens’ cases, respectively, ruled differently.

Zarda and Stephens both died while their cases moved forward, but their estates continued on behalf of their heirs.

SUPREME COURT UPHOLDS OBAMA APPOINTMENT OF OVERSIGHT BOARD DEALING WITH PUERTO RICO'S FINANCIAL CRISIS

The court justified their inclusion of sexual orientation and gender identity under Title VII by focusing on the law’s language, which prohibits discrimination “because of” sex, stating that as long as sex is a factor the discrimination, that is enough to trigger Title VII.

The majority goes on to use a hypothetical where an employer has two workers who are attracted to men, but one is a man and the other is a woman, stating that firing the man for being gay would be discriminating against him because of his sex because he has the same preference as the female employee. The court similarly discussed a potential situation where two workers identified as female but one was identified as male at birth and the other female.

""[T]he individual employee’s sex plays an unmistakable and impermissible role in the discharge decision,"" the court said about such situations.

Justice Samuel Alito said the majority went too far, calling the decision ""legislation,"" in a dissent joined by Justice Clarence Thomas.

""There is only one word for what the Court has done today: legislation. The document that the Court releases is in the form of a judicial opinion interpreting a statute, but that is deceptive,"" Alito wrote.

Alito noted that the majority opinion ""no doubt arises from humane and generous impulses,"" acknowledging the desire to treat gay, lesbian, and transgender people ""with the dignity, consideration, and fairness that everyone deserves,"" but said the court's role ""is limited to saying what the law is,"" not adding to it.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh made a similar argument in a dissent of his own.

""Under the Constitution’s separation of powers, the responsibility to amend Title VII belongs to Congress and the President in the legislative process, not to this Court,"" he wrote.

At the same time, Kavanaugh recognized the significance of the court's ruling for LGBT rights.

""Notwithstanding my concern about the Court’s transgression of the Constitution’s separation of powers, it is appropriate to acknowledge the important victory achieved today by gay and lesbian Americans,"" Kavanaugh wrote. ""Millions of gay and lesbian Americans have worked hard for many decades to achieve equal treatment in fact and in law. They have exhibited extraordinary vision, tenacity, and grit—battling often steep odds in the legislative and judicial arenas, not to mention in their daily lives. They have advanced powerful policy arguments and can take pride in today’s result.""",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/supreme-court-rules-gay-workers-protected-from-job-discrimination-in-big-win-for-lgbt-rights,N/A
Supreme Court to take up LGBT job discrimination cases,"The Supreme Court will decide whether the main federal civil rights law that prohibits employment discrimination applies to LGBT people.

The justices say Monday they will hear cases involving people who claim they were fired because of their sexual orientation. Another case involves a funeral home employee who was fired after disclosing that she was transitioning from male to female and dressed as a woman.

The cases will be argued in the fall, with decisions likely by June 2020 in the middle of the presidential election campaign.

The issue is whether Title VII of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits sex discrimination, protects LGBT people from job discrimination. Title VII does not specifically mention sexual orientation or transgender status, but federal appeals courts in Chicago and New York have ruled recently that gay and lesbian employees are entitled to protection from discrimination. The federal appeals court in Cincinnati has extended similar protections for transgender people.

The big question is whether the Supreme Court, with a strengthened conservative majority, will do the same.

The Obama administration had supported treating LGBT discrimination claims as sex discrimination, but the Trump administration has changed course. The Trump Justice Department has argued that Title VII was not intended to provide protections to gay or transgender workers. The administration also separately withdrew Obama-era guidance to educators to treat claims of transgender students as sex discrimination.

President Donald Trump has appointed two justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.

The justices will take up three cases in the fall.

In one, the federal appeals court in New York ruled in favor of a gay skydiving instructor who claimed he was fired because of his sexual orientation. The second case is from Georgia, where the federal appeals court ruled against a gay employee of Clayton County, in the Atlanta suburbs.

The third case comes from Michigan, where a funeral home fired a transgender woman. The appeals court in Cincinnati ruled that the firing constituted sex discrimination under federal law.

The funeral home argues in part that Congress was not thinking about transgender people when it included sex discrimination in Title VII.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/supreme-court-to-take-up-lgbt-job-discrimination-cases,N/A
Teacher running for Congress warns of psychological damage Disney's LGBT agenda may do to kids,"Gina Ciarcia, a former teacher running for Congress in Virginia, called The Walt Disney Company's opposition to a Florida parental rights bill ""appalling"" and warned of the psychological damage that teachers can do to young children by teaching them about sexuality too early.

Disney has taken a firm stance against the parental rights law H.B. 1557 , which critics have branded the ""Don't Say Gay"" law, even though the law does not ban the word ""gay."" Rather, the law prohibits classroom instruction – not casual discussion – on ""sexual orientation"" and ""gender identity"" with children in third grade or younger, ""or in a manner that is not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards.""

‘SILENT MAJORITY’ OF DISNEY EMPLOYEES SUPPORT FLORIDA LAW, DISNEY EMPLOYEE RUNNING FOR CONGRESS SAYS

""It’s appalling to see Disney so adamantly protesting the Parental Rights in Education bill,"" Ciarcia, a mother of five children who led a home-school co-op and who taught history, logic, literature, Latin, and writing at two private schools, told Fox News Digital on Friday. ""As a mother of five and a career teacher, I also find it extremely unnerving that a company responsible for creating so much of what our children watch would push against legislation to prevent content we know is harmful from reaching our children.""

""This bizarre insistence of the left to push sexuality-focused teaching and even, in the worst instances, pornographic material, to our K-3 students is not only disturbing and appalling, but will be truly psychologically and developmentally detrimental to our children,"" Ciarcia warned.

Parents in Virginia and other states have sounded the alarm about books they call obscene and pedophilic , but which librarians and LGBTQ activists defend as essential for diversity. ""Lawn Boy"" by Jonathan Evison, for instance, includes long sections of a boy reminiscing about explicit experiences he had at 10 years old and ""Gender Queer: A Memoir,"" by Maia Kobabe includes photos of sexual acts between a boy and a man.

DISNEY HAS BETRAYED THE VERY VALUES THAT WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS SUCCESS, ORTHODOX RABBIS WARN

""Young children are not emotionally prepared to grapple with these subjects, nor are they naturally inclined to want to,"" the former teacher said.

She framed the left's positions on such issues as a war on childhood innocence.

""All of this is really just the next stage in the left’s continual push to undo our entire understanding of childhood for the sake of political agendas,"" Ciarcia said. ""We’ve seen this for years, for instance in their push to emasculate our boys. Boys long to have something to fight for and defend, but are now told that this instinct is toxic. There are still dragons to slay, and we fail to communicate that to our boys.""

She also lamented that many cultural elites have ""traded fairytales and imaginative stories for thinly-veiled propaganda books.

US government: North Carolina LGBT law violates civil rights,"A North Carolina law limiting protections to LGBT people violates federal civil rights laws and can't be enforced, the U.S. Justice Department said Wednesday, putting the state on notice that it is in danger of being sued and losing hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding.

The law, which requires transgender people to use public bathrooms that conform to the sex on their birth certificate, has been broadly condemned by gay-rights groups, businesses and entertainers. Some have relocated offices or canceled shows in the state. Several other states have proposed similar laws in recent months limiting protections to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.

In a letter to Gov. Pat McCrory, the Justice Department said federal officials view the state law as violating federal Civil Rights Act protections barring workplace discrimination based on sex. Provisions of the state law directed at transgender state employees violate their anti-discrimination protections, the letter said.

""The State is engaging in a pattern or practice of discrimination against transgender state employees and both you, in your official capacity, and the state are engaging in a pattern or practice of resistance"" of their rights, the letter said.

The DOJ notification appeared to be an attempt by President Barack Obama's administration to extend a new requirement involving which bathrooms and locker rooms transgender people will be allowed to use, McCrory said.

""This is no longer just a North Carolina issue, because this conclusion by the Department of Justice impacts every state,"" McCrory said during a forum with the state's chamber of commerce. The move represented ""something we've never seen regarding Washington overreach in my lifetime.""

McCrory, who signed the bill into law in March, has defended the law and said he didn't think it would have any financial impact, either on the economy in general or on federal school funding in particular.

But shortly after it was passed, PayPal reversed plans to open a 400-employee operation center in Charlotte, Deutsche Bank froze expansion plans near Raleigh and convention officials reported some meetings were avoiding the state. Nearly 200 corporate leaders from across the country, including Charlotte-based Bank of America, have urged the law's repeal, arguing it's bad for business because it makes recruiting talented employees more difficult.

House Speaker Tim Moore, who helped pass the law known as House Bill 2, said he would speak with McCrory and Senate leader Phil Berger about the state's legal options. Moore told reporters that the letter was an attempt by the Obama administration to ""continue its radical left agenda"" in his final months in office.

""This is a gross overreach by the Obama Justice Department that deserves to be struck down in federal court,"" Berger said in a news release.

The Justice Department said in a separate letter to the 17-campus University of North Carolina system that the state law violates Title IX of the Civil Rights Act, which bars discrimination in education based on sex. That could lead to North Carolina losing hundreds of millions of dollars in federal school funding.

The letter effectively serves as a warning to the state to proceed at its own peril or risk being sued. Civil-rights groups and several individuals sued in North Carolina federal court in late March seeking to overturn the law.

McCrory and GOP legislators ""were warned about these dire consequences, but they ignored the law and the North Carolinians it would harm and passed the bill anyway,"" said a statement from the American Civil Liberties Union and Lambda Legal, which helped filed the lawsuit.

It has not been uncommon during the Obama administration for the Justice Department to weigh in on hot-button civil rights issues. In March, the department sharply discouraged state court administrators from jailing defendants who can't pay court fines for petty offenses. The letters to North Carolina don't have the force of law, but it puts the state on notice that its actions are being watched and run afoul of federal civil rights laws.

The letters seek confirmation by Monday that people can ""access bathrooms and other facilities consistent with their gender identity.""

The government could file a lawsuit to protect state employees from discrimination, the letters said.

The Justice Department's intervention could affect similar laws passed in other states.

Mississippi's House Bill 1523, which becomes law July 1, says government and business workers can deny services to people by citing their own religious beliefs that marriage should only be between a man and a woman and that a person's gender is set at birth and is unchangeable.

The day after Republican Gov. Phil Bryant signed the bill, Democratic U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi sent a letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch, asking her to block what he called the ""overreaching, unconstitutional, and blatantly discriminatory piece of legislation."" Thompson told The Associated Press in a text message Wednesday that he had heard about the Justice Department's letter to North Carolina.

""I would expect a similar letter to be sent to Mississippi in the near future,"" Thompson said. ""The circumstances in both states are closely aligned. Discrimination in the name of religion is illegal.""

Officials from Bryant's office and the Mississippi attorney general's office said they had not received a letter from the Justice Department by Wednesday.

""Mississippi's law prevents state agencies and political subdivisions from punishing employers that opt to have gender-specific standards"" for employees' dress or restroom use, Bryant spokesman Clay Chandler said. ""This law does not establish or mandate a specific policy for restroom facilities.""",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/us-government-north-carolina-lgbt-law-violates-civil-rights,N/A
Virginia state lawmaker to introduce bill making it a crime for parents not to affirm their LGBT child,"As the battle over parental rights and protections for LGBT students heats up in Virginia, one state delegate said she will introduce a bill in the legislature's next session that would make it a crime for a parent or guardian not to affirm their child's sexual orientation or gender identity.

The move is in response to Republican Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin's updated ""model policies"" on transgender students, which require students to use bathrooms and join sports teams based on their sex at birth, as opposed to their gender identity.

Democratic Virginia Delegate Elizabeth Guzman told WJLA on Thursday she will introduce a bill that will expand the state's definition of child abuse and neglect to include parents and guardian who do not affirm their LGBT children.

FORMER EDUCATION SEC. BETSY DEVOS SOUNDS OFF ON RUMORED BIDEN TITLE IX CHANGES: ‘A BRIDGE TOO FAR’

""The day that Governor Youngkin wanted to implement this policy, I immediately texted the policy lead of that committee and said, this is how we're going to push back,"" Guzman told the local news outlet.

""It could be a felony, it could be a misdemeanor, but we know that CPS charge could harm your employment, could harm their education, because nowadays many people do a CPS database search before offering employment.""

Guzman did not respond to questions from Fox News Digital about the details of her legislation.

In her interview with WJLA, Guzman did not explain what she meant by affirming LGBT children.

Youngkin's embrace of parental rights helped propel him to an upset victory over former democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe last year.

The Virginia Department of Education's new ""model policies"" that were announced last month argued that the guidelines under the previous administration ""disregarded the rights of parents and ignored other legal and constitutional principles that significantly impact how schools educate students, including transgender students.""

""This is about restoring power to parents,"" Youngkin told Fox News last month.

Vladimir Putin bans all 'LGBT propaganda' in far-reaching move,"Russian President Vladimir Putin signed legislation banning all LGBT ""propaganda"" on Sunday, according to Russian media.

The far-reaching bill prohibits the creation or sharing of content depicting nontraditional sexual relations, gender reassignment and pedophilia in a positive lights, according to state-run media. The law reportedly extends to social media platforms, as well as mass media like films and advertisement.

The law also has a provision pertaining to minors and empowers to country's media watchdog to implement systems preventing minors from viewing such content.

The law went into effect the same day it was signed, on Sunday.

USDA BLAMES RUSSIA FOR RISING PRICE OF THANKSGIVING DINNER

Putin has long waged a political war against the LGBT movement in Russia, and his allies have in the past cited the movement's success in the U.S. as an excuse for expansive actions.

CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE NOW 10% LGBT

State Duma Chairman Vyacheslav Volodin, who authored the bill, cited trends in the U.S. and Europe as a reason to pass it in November.

""He cited data from opinion polls, according to which 16% of Europeans aged 14 to 29 identify themselves as LGBT,"" the Duma reported at the time. ""And in the U.S. state of Maryland, the number of students who have not decided on their gender due to the promotion of non-traditional relationships has grown almost six times in two years and today makes up 45% of all students in the state.""

The Duma did not cite where it received the polls, and it was not immediately clear if the polls are in fact accurate.

Violations of the new law are mostly punished with fines, ranging from $800 for citizens infringing on the lowest tier to $160,000 for legal entities that infringe on the highest tier, which is pedophilia.

""For violation of the ban on propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations or preferences among people of any age, a fine of 50 thousand to 400 thousand rubles for citizens, from 100 thousand to 800 thousand – for officials, from 800 thousand to 5 million or suspension of activities up to 90 days – for legal entities,"" the Duma said. Fines are much higher for pedophilia violations – up to 800,000 rubles for people, 2 million rubles for officials and 10 million rubles for legal entities.

Youngkin hosts Virginia pride events angering some LGBT groups,"Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, hosted a series of Pride month events, angering several more liberal LGBTQ groups.

Youngkin, a former private equity CEO who ran on a conservative platform, namely supporting parental rights for school children, hosted a private Pride reception at the state Capitol in Richmond. All except one member of the Virginia LGBTQ+ Advisory Board boycotted the event, while the Washington Post reported that the group of openly gay, lesbian and transgender state legislators were not invited.

The one member of LGBTQ+ Advisory Board who chose to attend, Michael Berlucchi, a Republican city councilman from Virginia Beach, told WRC-TV of Youngkin’s reception that, ""this demonstration of outreach, of genuine communication is reflective of why he was elected.""

""I accepted his invitation because I perceived it to be a good-faith, honest attempt to engage all Virginians,"" Berlucchi separately told the Post of the event attended by about 50 people. ""There’s obviously a gap there… My attendance does not convey a total endorsement of the governor’s policies. Of course, we have more work to do, and that’s why dialogue and learning are essential.""

REPUBLICAN GOV. GLENN YOUNGKIN EXPANDING POLITICAL REACH OUTSIDE VIRGINIA

""The Governor is committed to leading on behalf of all Virginians and events like this help strengthen our communities and the spirit of Virginia,"" Youngkin’s spokeswoman Macaulay Porter said in a statement, nodding to his platform to be the state’s unifier on divisive issues.

Last week, Youngkin also traveled to Virginia Beach to meet with the Log Cabin Republicans, a conservative LGBTQ group.

""The Democrat Party and the people on the left, the left-leaning organizations, they all lambaste Republicans for not embracing the gay community. And then when one does, they lambaste, and they lose their minds,"" Casey Flores, president of the group’s new Richmond chapter, told WRC-TV.

Meanwhile, more liberal LGBTQ groups in Virginia issued press releases announcing that they would not attend the Pride month reception at the Virginia Capitol. James Millner, director of Virginia Pride, said he appreciated the invitation but would decline because, ""it is premature for this administration to celebrate LGBTQ+ equality when it has yet to take any meaningful steps to advance it.""

In the past, Youngkin, who is deeply religious, said he privately opposed gay marriage but accepted the practice as law.

During his campaign, he also defended a teacher who was suspended for refusing to use students’ preferred pronouns and had spoken out against transgender athletes playing on sports teams that do not align with their birth sex.

""The Governor should meet with citizen groups to discuss their concerns but given that nothing less than total capitulation to the LGBT agenda will appease these groups, this seems like a distraction,"" Victoria Cobb, president of the conservative Family Foundation of Virginia, which is advocates against same-sex marriage, said in a statement regarding Youngkin’s Pride reception.

Athletes in ACC urge lawmakers for repeal of NC's LGBT law,"RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) Four athletes from North Carolina's Atlantic Coast Conference schools have written a letter urging state lawmakers to repeal a law that limits the protections of LGBT people.

The letter was signed by North Carolina fencer Ezra Baeli-Wang, Duke football player Chris Taylor, North Carolina State diver Gabi McDermott and Wake Forest men's golfer Tanner Owen. They're members of the ACC's student-athlete advisory committee.

North Carolina lost 17 NCAA and ACC events during the current academic year because of the law. Scott Dupree, executive director of the Greater Raleigh Sports Alliance, has said the state could miss out on hosting NCAA championships until 2022 without a repeal.

Brazil transgender soccer team fights prejudice,"On a late May afternoon, the Bigtboys soccer team played its first match, a friendly game on a flood-lit neighborhood pitch bordered by chain-link fencing.

With only four months of weekly training in the bag, the Bigtboys lost 9-1 to the more established Alligaytors. But just being on the field was unusually liberating to players on a squad that bills itself as Rio de Janeiro's first transgender men's soccer club.

And when striker Caique Rodrigues scored the team's only goal, its supporters - mostly girlfriends and a handful of family members - screamed and shouted in excitement, temporarily drowning out their rivals' more numerous, largely male fan base.

For the two dozen Bigtboys players, the training pitch is also one of the few places where they feel at ease and can talk about their experiences, good and bad, without fear.

""People think we are fragile, that we are dolls, aesthetically changed,"" said midfielder Robert Ismerim de Souza, 26, who works at city hall. ""We're here to win, to conquer a lot of things.""

Bigtboys, Alligaytors and other LGBT teams that have formed across Brazil are counting on the nation's love of soccer to help fight prejudice amid a growing conservative tide. In late 2018, more than 57 million Brazilians voted for far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, who once said in an interview he would rather have a dead son, than a gay son.

Like many of his peers, Bigtboys midfielder Daniel Viana has struggled to make family and friends accept his identity. When still identifying as a woman, Viana came out as lesbian, leading to endless disputes with relatives. In an all-too-common scenario for transgender people, Viana wound up living in the streets. Within a few weeks, a group of five men assaulted him, raped him and got him pregnant.

""It's difficult for us, it's dangerous to walk in the street. We live in a society that is very prejudiced,"" said Viana, now 28 and living with his girlfriend, during one of his weekly trainings.

The rights group Transgender Europe said 167 transgender men and women were killed last year in Brazil, making the country one of the world's most dangerous for trans people.

Activists say the real numbers are likely to be far higher since hate crimes involving LGBT individuals are often not reported as such.

No laws specifically protect the country's large LGBT community, though many have celebrated a Supreme Federal Court ruling stating that a law against racism also shields gay and trans people. It's not final — the last votes are expected to be cast Thursday — but a majority of justices has already ruled in favor.

Even so, bills in Congress to outlaw homophobia have faced fierce opposition from an ever-growing number of conservative and evangelical lawmakers.

""Despite dozens of bills, only homophobic and transphobic discrimination remains without any kind of (legal sanction),"" Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes said during a session in February. Another criticized the ""evident inertia and omission"" by lawmakers.

It's not the first time the court has advanced gay rights in the absence of legislative action. It ruled in favor of same-sex unions in 2011, more than 15 years after a bill was first introduced to legalize them.

For players of the Bigtboys, the Supreme Court ruling isn't a solution in itself, but a symbolic win, nevertheless.

""It was always a crime. We just did not have that kind of visibility; we were hidden,"" said Ismerim, noting that not too long ago, gay and transgender people were considered mentally ill. ""It's not that I don't feel scared anymore, but now I know that the state is on our side. We can live; before we were only surviving.""

Still, the rise of Bolsonaro and a socially conservative wave has alarmed the LGBT community.

""The government changed, and the doors started closing,"" said Cristian Lins Silva, a 45-year-old photojournalist who put together the team after losing a bid for state representative in Rio de Janeiro last year. ""I had enough of knocking on doors asking for help and not getting anything.""

Viana said he'd often felt suicidal and has found hope in the team, which is a sort of newfound family. His girlfriend of four months agreed.

The team ""is showing the strength they have. They do what they like, each one with his dreams, his goals,"" said Mariana Farias de Souza. ""They are no different from anyone, not incapable of anything.""",https://www.foxnews.com/sports/transgender-soccer-team-fights-prejudice,N/A
Amazon opposes anti-LGBT Tennessee legislation amid activist pressure,"Amazon has signed a letter opposing a raft of anti-LGBT legislation in Tennessee as the tech giant plans to expand its presence in the business-friendly state.

""Legislation that explicitly or implicitly allows discrimination against LGBT people and their families creates unnecessary liability for talent recruitment and retention, tourism, and corporate investment to the state,"" the open letter to Tennesse legislators states.

The Jeff Bezos-led behemoth joined Salesforce, Dell Technologies, Postmates, Warner Music Group, Nashville Ballet, Nashville Cares and more than a dozen other companies in urging legislative leaders to reject several bills currently making their way through the Tennessee legislature. A spokesperson for Amazon confirmed the company did sign the letter.

US NAVY DRAFTING NEW GUIDELINES FOR REPORTING UFOS

Tennessee lawmakers are currently debating or considering bills that would ban same-sex couples from adopting and getting married, and restrict transgender people's access to public bathrooms, according to the Tennessean.

The letter, which was posted by a bipartisan advocacy group called Freedom For All Americans, continues: ""We’ve seen time and again that discriminatory policies that negatively impact LGBT people and their families have drastic economic consequences, and such policies would surely put Tennessee at an economic disadvantage.""

Earlier this month, a group of activists sent a letter to members of Glamazons, the retail giant's LGBT employee resource group, asking them to pressure the company regarding Tennessee's anti-LGBT legislation.

""Thank you to Amazon, especially the Glamazons, for standing up for LGBTQ Tennesseans today by opposing this hateful and discriminatory legislation,"" said ""No Gay? No Way!"" campaign manager Conor Gaughan in a statement provided to Fox News. ""It sends an important message to legislators here in Tennessee, and across the country, that Amazon – alongside America's best corporations – are taking notice of laws and policies in the states where they do business; there will be consequences when states threaten LGBTQ rights.""

AMAZON LAUNCHES IN-GARAGE DELIVERY SERVICE

Sponsors of the bills claim they are trying to protect ""religious freedom.""

Last March, the activist campaign called on Amazon to only consider LGBT-friendly states for its planned second headquarters. Amazon ultimately picked Virginia's Crystal City and New York, although it eventually pulled out of the latter after pressure from local advocates and politicians.

This isn't the first time that corporate America has played a role in opposing anti-LGBT legislation. A host of companies and organizations, including PayPal, the NCAA, Adidas and CoStar canceled plans to build, expand offices or host events in North Carolina – representing $3.7 billion in lost investment over 12 years according to an Associated Press analysis – during the debate over that state's 2016 ""bathroom bill."" The bill has since been partly repealed.

The open letter states: ""As we recruit new talent and seek to retain our world-class workforce, we often face questions about whether our state is a welcoming and inclusive place to live for the LGBT community. It is both a business imperative and a part of our corporate values that our employees and their families, and potential employees, feel welcomed and included in the prosperity of our state.""",https://www.foxnews.com/tech/amazon-anti-lgbt-tennessee-legislation-pressure,N/A
Facebook 'shamed' LGBT users with 'gay cure' ads,"Facebook showed ""predatory"" gay conversion therapy adverts to young LGBT people designed to ""shame"" and ""hurt"" them.

Some users reported seeing the ads promoting ""sexual purity"" and ""gay cures"" as a result of the other Facebook pages they had shown an interest in, according to the Telegraph.

When outraged users clicked on the ""why I am I seeing this ad?"" option they were told that Facebook believed they were interested in ""gender issues"".

One of the ads was a video called ""Homosexuality was my identity"" that was promoting gay conversion therapy: a form of treatment that aims to change a person's sexual orientation based on the assumption that homosexuality is a mental illness that can be ""cured"".

Several organisations, including NHS England, the British Psychological Society, and the Royal College of Psychiatrists published a “memorandum of understanding” in 2014 describing conversion therapy as “unethical and potentially harmful”.

Facebook user Tessa Ann Schwartz, who complained after viewing one of the ads on the social network, said: “I don’t know why Facebook has permitted this group to target LGBT people, who have intentionally sought out community and education amongst peers, for shaming and hatred masked as love.”

Another conversion therapy ad promoted a self-help book called Help for Men with Same-Sex Attraction.

Alystair Ryder, a user who saw the advert, said he felt ""shaken"" by it, adding that “it was written in a way to try to appeal to people who may be depressed or self loathing due to their sexuality"".

He continued: ""I think it’s pretty irresponsible for Facebook to allow an advert that preys on gay men with mental health issues in such a negative way on their homepage.”

We reached out to Facebook but did not immediately receive a response.

The company told the Telegraph that a ""micro-targeting"" algorithm blunder caused the since removed ads to appear on young LGBT users' feeds.

This isn't the first time Facebook's ad-targeting tool has come under fire.

"Anti-gay supporters rally for Moore, worrying LGBT community","A smiling Roy Moore stood shoulder to shoulder with his fiercest religious allies.

Flanked by a huge sign for Moore's Senate campaign, one supporter railed against the ""LGBT mafia"" and ""homosexualist gay terrorism."" Another warned that ""homosexual sodomy"" destroys those who participate in it and the nations that allow it. And still another described same-sex marriage as ""a mirage"" because ""it's phony and fake.""

Thursday's news conference was designed to send a powerful message to the political world that religious conservatives across America remain committed to Moore, a Christian conservative and former judge whose Alabama Senate campaign has been rocked by mounting allegations of sexual misconduct. The event also revealed an aggressive strain of homophobia rarely seen in mainstream politics — in recent years, at least.

In the days since, religious liberals have stepped forward to express their opposition to Moore. More than 50 Alabama pastors signed a letter saying Moore has demonstrated ""extremist values"" incompatible with traditional Christianity and is unfit to serve in the Senate. And an anti-Moore rally at a Birmingham church on Saturday drew more than 100 people, some of whom carried signs decrying his opposition to gay rights.

But in a Senate campaign suddenly hyper focused on Moore's relationships with teenage girls decades ago, Moore's hardline stance on gay rights and other LGBT issues has become little more than an afterthought for many voters as Election Day approaches.

Moore first caught the attention of many in the LGBT community after describing homosexual conduct as ""an inherent evil against which children must be protected"" in a 2002 child custody case involving a lesbian mother. In a 2005 television interview, Moore said ""homosexual conduct should be illegal."" He also said there's no difference between gay sex and sex with a cow, horse or dog.

Moore's stand — combined with the fiery comments from his supporters — unnerved some in Birmingham's relatively small LGBT community.

""It made me extremely angry,"" said Mackenzie Gray, a 37-year-old who came out as transgender in 2010. She says most people in her life don't know she was born a man.

""My fear with the religious leaders and the hateful rhetoric we're hearing is that it's going to start escalating into something even larger,"" Gray said. ""It's dangerous.""

Indeed, other LGBT activists suggested this week that open acceptance of Moore's anti-gay rhetoric harkens to a dark and violent time in Alabama history.

Moore's Democratic challenger, Doug Jones, is known best, perhaps, for prosecuting the men who bombed Birmingham's 16th Street Baptist Church — a prosecution that came nearly 40 years after the 1963 crime that killed four black girls. Racial tensions have lingered in the state, even as the violence lessened. In 2000, Alabama became the last state in the country to overturn its ban on interracial marriage.

The state has been slow to embrace gay rights as well: 81 percent of voters supported a ban on same-sex marriage in 2006. Only neighboring Mississippi, with 86 percent, scored higher.

Patricia Todd, the state's first openly gay state representative, says she has faced at least four death threats in recent years. One woman called Todd's cell phone and vowed to kill her and her family, she said, noting that local LGBT leaders meet quarterly at the FBI office in Birmingham to help identify potential hate crimes.

""It's been brutal, but it's gotten to the point where I just laugh at them,"" Todd said Friday.

She's not laughing at Moore.

""It's awful because he says the most hateful things,"" she said.

In contrast to many conservative politicians with national ambitions, Moore has made little attempt to change his tone on LGBT issues as equal rights for the gay community has earned increasing acceptance among mainstream America.

Moore's hero status among many Christian conservatives was cemented in 2016 when, as the chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, he refused to comply with a Supreme Court ruling that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. He was later suspended, the second time he was forcibly removed from the state Supreme Court.

Earlier this month, Moore said, ""The transgenders don't have rights,"" during a news conference, according to the Montgomery Advertiser.

Moore's unapologetic positions — and his repeated promises to take them to the U.S. Senate if elected on Dec. 12 — were celebrated at Thursday's news conference by the religious leaders who traveled from as far as Colorado, Ohio and Texas to stand at his side.

Rabbi Noson Leiter, who once called Hurricane Sandy's destruction ""divine justice"" for same-sex marriage, lashed out at ""homosexualist gay terrorism.""

""We need Judge Moore to stand up to the LGBT transgender mafia,"" Leiter said. He added, ""We need someone with a proven record of facing off against the gay terrorists.""

Another Moore supporter, Texas Christian activist Steven Hotze, warned in 2015 that children would be ""encouraged to practice sodomy in kindergarten"" as a result of same-sex marriage. On Thursday, Hotze refused to describe the union of two gay people as marriage: ""It's 'mirage' because it's just like a mirage — it's phony and it's fake.""

North Carolina-based Christian activist Flip Benham last year warned in a Charlotte City Council meeting that the policies that protect the civil rights of transgender people would trigger ""bloodshed coursing down the corners of our streets.""

""We're praising everything that God says is wrong and will destroy you,"" he said Thursday. ""Homosexual sodomy destroys those who participate in that behavior and nations that approve of it.""

He offered a pointed message to Moore's critics: God ""doesn't send anyone to hell. It's a place you choose to go.""

Benham then turned to Moore, who was sitting a few feet away with his wife. ""You got the applause of heaven.""

Bills to curtail LGBT rights are failing in US legislatures,"In a striking shift from recent years, major legislation curtailing LGBT rights has been completely stymied in state capitols around the country this year amid anxiety by Republican leaders over igniting economic backlash if they are depicted as discriminatory.

In the thick of this year's legislative sessions, LGBT activists were tracking about 120 proposed bills that they viewed as threats to their civil rights. Not one of them has been enacted as many sessions now wind down; only two remain under serious consideration.

A key factor in the shift: In the Republican-led states where these types of bills surface, moderate GOP lawmakers and business leaders are increasingly wary of losing conventions, sporting events and corporate headquarters.

North Carolina, Indiana and Arizona were among the states that faced similar backlash in recent years over such legislation.

""Being anti-equality is not considered good politics anymore,"" said legislative specialist Cathryn Oakley of the Human Rights Campaign, a national LGBT rights organization.

Just two years ago, it seemed that the state-level bills might proliferate. North Carolina passed a bill restricting transgender people's bathroom access and Mississippi enacted a sweeping law allowing state employees and private businesses to deny services to LGBT people based on religious objections. Seven states have passed laws allowing faith-based adoption agencies some degree of protection if they refuse to place children with same-sex couples.

To the extent that the tide has turned, it's due partly to the fallout over the North Carolina bill in 2016. The NCAA and NBA pulled games from the state; there were projections before lawmakers rolled back the restrictions that the law would cost the state several billion dollars in lost business.

The change in momentum at the state level comes at a time when conservatives have a strong ally in President Donald Trump on the issue. His administration is seeking to exclude transgender people from military service and promoting exemptions that could enable businesses, health care providers and others to refuse to accommodate LGBT people based on their religious beliefs.

Later this year, perhaps in June, a potentially momentous ruling is expected from the U.S. Supreme Court on whether businesses that serve the public can cite religious objections to refuse service to LGBT people, even in states that protect them in their nondiscrimination laws. The case involves a Colorado baker who did not want to make a cake for a same-sex couple to celebrate their wedding.

Some conservatives suggest legislative leaders are treading softly on these issues now for fear of provoking big corporations and pro sports leagues that support LGBT rights.

""The left is leveraging the cultural and economic power of big businesses like Amazon and Apple to force smaller businesses and nonprofits that hold traditional views on marriage to shut down,"" contends attorney Emilie Kao, a religious freedom expert with the conservative Heritage Foundation.

""A lot of people feel they're being bullied into silence, and the big businesses are all on the side of this new sexual orthodoxy,"" Kao added. ""For social conservatives, it feels very much like David and Goliath.""

This year, certainly, conservatives have struggled to gain much traction at the state level on LGBT-related issues. Among the many bills that failed:

—A Tennessee measure that would have required the state to defend schools in court if they were sued for limiting transgender students' access to bathrooms.

—A South Dakota bill that would have required signs on some public restroom doors notifying users that a person of the opposite sex might be inside.

—A ""religious liberties"" bill in Georgia that would have given legal protection to faith-based adoption agencies that decline to place children with same-sex couples.

An ever-growing number of states — at least a dozen — have passed bills banning the practice of ""gay conversion therapy"" on minors. And voters in Anchorage, Alaska, rejected a ballot measure that would have restricted transgender people's access to public restrooms.

The two remaining bills being tracked by LGBT groups — in Kansas and Oklahoma — are similar to Georgia's adoption bill. Supporters say they are needed to ensure that faith-based agencies which oppose same-sex marriage can still help accommodate the rising number of children entering foster care due to the opioid crisis.

Without the bills, Kao says faith-based agencies face potential lawsuits by LGBT-rights groups ""because they follow their beliefs that every child deserves both a mother and a father.""

The changing dynamics across the U.S. reflect the growing political clout of LGBT groups.

Megadonor Tim Gill has become one of the nation's leading philanthropists for LGBT causes, spending tens of millions of dollars from his fortune accrued from a software company he started. One of his priorities now is to move beyond ""the easy states"" and build new alliances in Republican-controlled states that could pave the way for non-discrimination laws.

His Denver-based foundation is helping bankroll a national campaign being launched this week by the Ad Council, known for iconic public service ad campaigns including Smokey Bear and ""Friends Don't Let Friends Drive Drunk."" Called ""Beyond I Do,"" it makes the point that while same-sex marriage is now legal nationwide, LGBT people still face legal discrimination in a majority of states — including getting evicted, fired or denied services.

Only 19 states — mostly Democratic strongholds — offer comprehensive nondiscrimination protections for gays, lesbians and transgender people.

The new ad campaign is projected to get at least $15 million in donated media support — including TV and radio time, and billboard space. Among the people featured in more than 20 stories and video spots are a Michigan couple who said a pediatrician refused to treat their newborn daughter because of objections to their same-sex marriage, and an Ohio woman who says she was fired as a teacher because she is a lesbian.

""We have to make new and different friends,"" Gill said. ""Ultimately a federal solution is better, but it always comes after the states have demonstrated the need.""",https://www.foxnews.com/us/bills-to-curtail-lgbt-rights-are-failing-in-us-legislatures,N/A
Christian childcare teacher who refused to read LGBT books to kids sues after being fired: 'Blatantly illegal',"A California childcare teacher sued her former employer last week after she was allegedly terminated and mistreated because of her religious objection to reading books to children featuring same-sex couples.

Nelli Parisenkova, who is being represented by lawyers with the Thomas More Society, worked four years at Bright Horizons Children's Center in Studio City and cared for children aged five and younger, according to the complaint she filed Thursday in the Superior Court of California.

The lawsuit claims Parisenkova was aware of such LGBT-themed material at the Studio City location of the largest childcare company in the U.S., but at first had not been required to read them. Founded in 1986, Bright Horizons has hundreds of locations worldwide and employs more than 26,000 people.

Parisenkova's situation changed in April when Katy Callas, who serves as director of the location, learned of Parisenkova’s religious objections to the material, refused her request for a religious accommodation and ultimately created a hostile work environment that led to her termination, according to the complaint.

MICHIGAN HEALTH TERMINATED PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT FOR RELIGIOUS BELIEFS, LAWYER SAYS: ‘SERIOUS INJUSTICE’

The complaint explained how for Parisenkova, who is ""a devout Christian,"" reading such books to children ""would violate her religious beliefs and constitute promotion of intimate relationships and choices that are contrary to the teachings of her faith.""

""Parisenkova formally requested a religious accommodation from Bright Horizons that aligned with her prior informally granted request. Bright Horizons responded by categorically denying the request,"" the suit said, which goes on to claim Bright Horizons ""made no attempt whatsoever to determine whether a reasonable accommodation could be reached.""

""Instead, Bright Horizons issued a counseling memo with false statements, terminated her life insurance benefits, required her to complete retraining in diversity issues, and encouraged her to resign her position,"" the suit alleged. ""Ms. Parisenkova could not return to work without an accommodation; so, Bright Horizons terminated her employment.""

The suit slaps Bright Horizons and its staff with several charges, including unlawful retaliation, failure to prevent discrimination and harassment, religion-based harassment, wrongful termination, failure to accommodate, unlawful constructive discharge and disparate treatment.

Bright Horizons has been outspoken in its support for LGBT community, documenting in October 2018 how its centers celebrated LGBT History Month by participating in Pride parades and reading LGBT-themed books to children. In 2019, the organization also endorsed the Equality Act, which would add sexual orientation and gender identity to federal antidiscrimination policy.

Paul Jonna, special counsel at the Thomas More Society and one of Parisenovka's attorneys, described her case in a statement as ""an outrageous example of religious discrimination.""

Jonna said Parisenovka ""had been operating under the radar with an informal accommodation request for multiple years without notice,"" but that ""as soon as upper-level management discovered her religious beliefs and received her formal accommodation request,"" Bright Horizons leveled against her ""the full force of the company’s anti-religious and ironically ‘un-inclusive’ diversity policy.""

""They tried to get her to quit through harassment and intimidation. When she couldn’t return to work because they denied her accommodation request, they fired her,"" Jonna added. ""You can’t get much more discriminatory than that. It’s unethical, and it’s blatantly illegal.""

Jonna also claimed that when his client was called into Callas' office, the director ""questioned her in an irate manner, told her that if she did not want to celebrate diversity this was not the place for her to work, gave her an administrative leave memo, escorted her outside with a security guard, and left her out in the 96-degree heat with no transportation.""

Parisenovka reportedly had to walk 20 minutes in the scorching weather, waiting 45 minutes for transportation and suffering from heat exhaustion for the next two days.

Indiana Christian school at center of LGBT voucher debate,"The Lighthouse Christian Academy promises to provide an exemplary education, a caring atmosphere and service to God — but not for everyone. The school says in its admissions brochure that it reserves the right to deny admission to LGBT students because their lifestyle is prohibited by the Bible.

As the Trump administration seeks to expand school choice nationwide, the academy was thrust into the national spotlight last month as part of a heated debate over whether schools that receive money from taxpayer-funded vouchers can discriminate against certain groups of students, such as LGBT children or students with disabilities.

Lighthouse officials say they've never turned anyone away based on sexual orientation. But at a congressional hearing, Senate Democrats cited it as an example of a school that discriminates against LGBT students. A Lighthouse brochure says the Bible does not allow homosexual, bisexual or ""any form of sexual immorality"" and if a student's ""home life"" violates biblical rules, the school can deny them admission or expel them.

Pressed on the issue, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, an ardent supporter of school choice, told the Senate committee that discrimination is wrong, but that it was up to Congress and the courts, not her department, to intervene.

Founded in the early 1990s by a tight-knit group of families who wanted an affordable Christian education for their children, the academy is now an academically successful K-12 school serving 300 children in the Bloomington area. About half receive vouchers to help pay an annual tuition that ranges from $4,500 to $6,000 depending on a student's grade.

This year, Lighthouse received over $665,000 in state funds to enroll 152 students.

DeVos and the Trump administration are strong proponents of giving states a greater role in education. Earlier this year, the administration rescinded former President Barack Obama's guidance that instructed to schools to let students use school restrooms in accordance with the gender they identify with, not their sex at birth. The move sparked criticism from the civil rights community.

The administration is looking at taxpayer-funded vouchers as a way to expand school choice nationwide, but it has not yet come out with a specific plan on how to do it.

Indiana is one of 30 states that use public money for school choice programs, including vouchers, educational savings accounts and tax-credit scholarships. The District of Columbia has the country's only federally funded voucher program. All told, some 450,000 students participate nationally.

In a study last year, Indiana University professor Suzanne Eckes found that none of the states with voucher programs prohibits discrimination against LGBT students.

Lighthouse defends its right to educate children according to its values, saying that Christians are state taxpayers, too, and should be allowed to fund institutions of their choice with their money.

""Parents are free to choose which school best comports with their religious convictions,"" Brian Bailey, an attorney who is serving as the school's spokesman, said in a statement. ""For a real choice and thus real liberty to exist, the government may not impose its own orthodoxy and homogenize all schools to conform to politically correct attitudes and ideologies.""

Former Lighthouse student Mary Wegener, 24, says some of her classmates at the school were gay and received love and care. Bailey confirmed that the school did admit some students who were ""tempted by same-sex intimacy,"" saying ""we teach our students to flee these sins.""

Wegener sees both sides of the story, but says a religious school cannot function contrary to its core beliefs.

""If they (Lighthouse) are going to be a Christian school, they can't conform to everything else, because then that would be a private school that knocked out the Christian name.""

Carissa Dollar, 46, of Indianapolis, who has a transgender daughter, is unconvinced.

""I have a problem with public funds going to a private institution who then make decisions that would be discriminatory to any group,"" Dollar said. ""It's wrong if an LGBT student, or even if someone in their family identifies on the LGBT spectrum, could be denied admission to the school.""

Dick Komer, senior attorney with Institute for Justice, a libertarian public interest law firm, said that federal law has protections against discrimination on the basis of race, national identity, sex and religion, but they do not extend to LGBT individuals.

""If the people who are grilling DeVos believe that sex includes sexual orientation and gender identity, then they should propose amendments to the statues that they have written and given her to enforce,"" Komer said. ""The Congress is supposed to write the law, the agency is supposed to administer what Congress has given them. And Congress hasn't given it to them.""

Eckes, the Indiana University professor, said states must create protections to ensure that any benefit they create is available to all. She said that decades ago some private schools used their own interpretation of the Bible to exclude African-American students and federal protections were necessary to stop those practices.

""If you accept public money in the form of a voucher then you shouldn't be able to discriminate whether it's based on race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, disability or sexual orientation,"" Eckes said. ""If you agree to take that public money, then there are certain rules that you need to follow.""

Lindsey Burke, director of education policy studies at the conservative Heritage Foundation, disagrees.

""Racism was based on identity and skin color and had no reasonable basis,"" Burke said. ""This is about whether a student, a family is going to live out their communal beliefs of the school that they have chosen to attend. These are intentional communities that are built upon a moral code that they have decided on.""

Lily Eskelsen García, president of the National Education Association, the country's largest teachers' union, said the Trump administration's attempt to fund private schools takes away money from public schools, where discrimination is not allowed.

""Every child, every blessed child has the legal, civil and the human right to attend their public school, but no one can say that about a private school,"" Eskelsen Garcia said. ""Why would you get public dollars to a school that discriminates against students?""

Judge rules Yeshiva University must recognize LGBT student group,"The New York County Supreme Court mandated Tuesday that Yeshiva University (YU) in New York City must recognize the YU Pride Alliance, an LGBT club on campus.

Judge Lynn Kotler ruled Tuesday that because the Modern Orthodox institution is chartered as a non-religious organization, YU must comply with the New York City Human Rights Law and ""immediately grant plaintiff YU Pride Alliance the full equal accommodations, advantages, facilities and privileges afforded to all other student groups at Yeshiva University.""

Kotler also ordered that defendants YU and President Ari Berman be ""permanently restrained from continuing their refusal to officially recognize the YU Pride Alliance as a student organization because of the members’ sexual orientation or gender and/or YU Pride Alliance’s status, mission, and/or activities on behalf of LGBTQ students.""

The judge also argued that because ""Yeshiva University is not a ‘religious corporation,’"" it cannot ban a student group based on Jewish beliefs.

""As our name indicates, Yeshiva University was founded to instill Torah values in its students while providing a stellar education, allowing them to live with religious conviction as noble citizens and committed Jews.

LGBT group taking gay pride T-shirt case to state Supreme Court,"Critics of a Kentucky appellate court’s decision allowing a T-shirt printer to refuse the business of a LGBT organization on religious grounds have decided to file a legal appeal of the action to the state’s highest court.

The Lexington Human Rights Commission’s decision Monday follows the group’s second consecutive legal defeat in its battle with Blaine Adamson of Hands On Originals, a T-shirt company. In 2012, Adamson refused a LGBT group’s request to make T-shirts promoting a gay pride festival because doing so would violate his Christian beliefs.

After the Lexington Human Rights Commission (LHRC) ruled that Adamson had violated the city’s fairness ordinance, he took the group to court and won. The LHRC then asked the Kentucky Court of Appeals to review the decision, and Friday it lost again in a 2-1 vote.

“We have 30 days to file [an appeal],” Raymond Sexton, the LHRC’s executive director said to Fox News.

“We were surprised and disappointed about the court’s decision. Last night, our board unanimously voted to file for a discretionary review. Our position remains the same, that is it was about the message being printed then Hands On Originals would have declined to do the work immediately. It wasn’t until they found out what event the shirts were for that they had a problem.”

“But when they present a message that conflicts with my religious beliefs, that’s not something that I can print. That’s the line for me.” — Blaine Adamson

Adamson, who has been represented by the Alliance Defending Freedom with support from the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, said he never had any intention to be hostile to gays or refuse their business.

“I never thought living out my faith would be the cause of so much controversy,” Adamson said in a statement provided to Fox News.

“People often ask me why I made that decision. Here is what I tell them: I will work with any person, no matter who they are, no matter what their belief systems are. But when they present a message that conflicts with my religious beliefs, that’s not something that I can print. That’s the line for me.”

The city’s fairness ordinance prohibits businesses that cater to the public from discriminating against people based on sexual orientation. The appellate court’s chief judge, Joy A. Kramer, wrote in the majority opinion that what Adamson objected to was spreading a gay group’s message of pride in their sexual orientation – not the fact that they were gay.

Adamson, who says that he has regularly employed and served LGBT individuals and serves everyone regardless of race, gender or sexual orientation, says he feels vindicated but that he still may have to defend his right to free speech.

“In my case, thankfully the legal system has worked,” Adamson says. “[The court] found that I do not refuse to do business because of who people are, but because of the messages that I’m asked to print. We’re so grateful for that ruling. But that decision is not set in stone.”

Adamson maintains his belief that religious liberty is the first and most important freedom.

“As I have gone through this process, I have often marveled that something like this can actually occur in America. This is not the way it should be,” he says.

“But you’re not free if your beliefs are confined to your mind. Everyone in world history under every sort of government regime has been ‘free to believe’ in their mind. What makes America unique is our freedom to peacefully live out those beliefs.”",https://www.foxnews.com/us/lgbt-group-taking-gay-pride-t-shirt-case-to-state-supreme-court,N/A
"LGBT group warns 'dragphobia' is on the rise, conservatives blast post on Twitter","A prominent LGBT group warned this week that ""dragphobia"" is on the rise in the U.S. as public outcry continues to grow against drag shows in public places that allow children in the audience.

""There is clear and present danger against our community and threats... we really haven't seen it at this level in over a decade, if ever,"" GLAAD president and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis said on the ""Takeaway"" podcast this week in a conversation the group posted on Twitter.

""Dragphobia is on the Rise,"" the Twitter post said.

Ellis explained that politicians have been ""targeting"" LGBT groups with legislation since the beginning of the year and cited ""vile rhetoric that we're seeing that's amplified on right-wing media and spread across extremist social media sites.""

TWITTER USERS SCORCH BIDEN ADMINISTRATION FOR INVITING DRAG QUEEN TO WHITE HOUSE: 'IT'S A SLAP IN THE FACE'

""There's a real threat against our community right now,"" Ellis said.

The Twitter post received criticism from conservatives on social media, including from users who have spoken out against drag shows that perform with kids in the audience, which many have argued contributes to the sexualization of children.

""Wanting to shield children from sexual adult entertainment, whose stated goal is to encourage queerness, is now called 'dragphobia,'"" the popular conservative Twitter account Libs of TikTok posted. ""They can make up whatever terms they want and call us all kinds of names but that doesn’t change the fact that drag isn’t appropriate for kids.""

CHILDREN'S MUSEUM IN VIRGINIA HOSTS ‘PRIDE NIGHT WITH LEGENDARY SANTA,' DRAG QUEEN PLAYS THE SNOW QUEEN

""Sooo...the groomers are calling anti-groomers ‘dragphobes’ now... got it,"" conservative comedian Tim Young posted.

""And with that, drag queens have officially become their very own identity group,"" conservative author and commentator Matt Walsh tweeted. ""Next they will add it to the LGBT acronym and give them their own color on the flag.""

Drag queen story hours and other drag events involving children have become a point of contention for parents across the country, with many conservatives arguing kids shouldn't be in the audience at such events due to their sexually explicit nature.

"Massive crowd protests Trump, anti-LGBT law in North Carolina","A massive crowd took to the streets in North Carolina on Saturday in opposition of President Donald Trump and to a state law limiting LGBT rights for an annual civil rights march.

The ""Moral March on Raleigh"" was led by the North Carolina NAACP for an 11th year.

Officials in Raleigh didn’t provide any information on crowd numbers. Organizers of the event predicted about 20,000 protesters.

The surface area that the crowd covered neared the march's previous peak from 2014.

March participants promoted different issues from gerrymandering and immigration to public education.

The protesters also want a House Bill 2 repeal, which limits LGBT rights and which bathrooms transgender people can use.

Methodist leaders say 'rebellion and dysfunction' over LGBT issues splitting denomination,"Several Methodist leaders said the third-largest Protestant denomination in the United States is facing a growing divide as conservative clergy push back against liberals they claim are being disobedient to the church.

""[Liberal clergy] are the ones who are not abiding by the pronouncements of our General Conference, which speaks for the entire church,"" Rev. Keith Boyette told Fox News Digital. ""So they're acting in violation of the provisions of our Book of Discipline, which undermines the effectiveness of the church.""

Boyette, who serves as a top staff person at the newly established Global Methodist Church, calls it a ""rebellion"" by some liberal clergy who refuse to abide by the church's rules, resulting in an inevitable split.

The North Georgia Conference of the United Methodist Church (UMC) voted last Thursday to allow 70 churches in the state to disaffiliate largely over LGBTQ issues, and more are expected to depart as 35 congregations in Arkansas and over 100 in Florida are in the midst of a discernment process to consider following suit.

DOZENS OF GEORGIA CHURCHES SPLIT FROM UNITED METHODIST CHURCH OVER LGBTQ ISSUES

Some are slated to join the Global Methodist Church, which is a conservative international Methodist denomination that formally began May 1.

At a special session of the General Conference in 2019, the UMC voted 438-384 to uphold the church’s ban on ordaining LGBTQ clergy and officiating at or hosting same-sex marriages.

The UMC also adopted a disaffiliation agreement that year providing a path for churches to leave the denomination through the end of 2023 ""for reasons of conscience"" related to the practice of homosexuality or the ordination or marriage of ""self-avowed practicing homosexuals,"" which is forbidden in the church's Book of Discipline.

THOUSANDS OF CHURCHES RAISE ALARM ABOUT SCOPE OF NEW CANADIAN ‘CONVERSION THERAPY’ BAN

Several conservative members of the Methodist clergy told Fox News that far from settling the issue, however, the 2019 vote was disregarded by many liberal leaders within the UMC who decided to remain in the denomination while commissioning openly gay clergy and officiating same-sex weddings anyway.

Boyette said debate has been waged over various issues within the UMC for half a century and could have continued were it not that those who disagree with the church's teachings are ""blatantly disobeying"" them in ways that bring dishonor on the institution and sow chaos in its administration.

""The church has been impotent to address those acts of rebellion and dysfunction,"" he added.

UNITED METHODISTS EDGE TOWARD BREAKUP OVER LGBT POLICIES

Rev. Thomas Lambrecht, the vice president of the denomination's traditionalist Good News caucus, echoed Boyette's assertions, saying the centrists and progressives in the UMC who chose to defy the church instead of leaving rendered it ""essentially ungovernable.""

Several clergy members told Fox News that while the sexuality debate is important, they see it as a ""presenting symptom"" of deeper divisions that have been simmering within the denomination for decades.

Multiple sources traced the seeds of the present disunity back even further when theological liberalism that questioned the Bible's authority swept into U.S. seminaries from Europe during the 19th century.

Bishop Scott Jones, a Houston-based prelate who serves as the resident bishop of the UMC's Texas Annual Conference, said many believe the fundamental disagreement among Methodists hinges on biblical interpretation and church doctrine.

""There are people who believe that reason and experience should have a higher level of influence on how the Bible is read,"" he said of liberals. ""Conservatives tend to emphasize the authority of Scripture.""

TUCKER: MODERN LIBERALS HATE CHRISTIANITY, NOT BECAUSE IT'S REPRESSIVE, BUT BECAUSE THEY ARE

Rev. Tom Berlin of Floris United Methodist Church in Herndon, Virginia, pushed back against Methodists he suggested are leaving because they have not gotten their way.

Berlin, who classified himself within the centrist wing of the church, emphasized the complexity that comes with having a diverse denomination of more than 12 million members around the world.

""If you choose to be in a denomination that large, that is global in nature, you have to face the fact that in different cultures, people will be doing different things that may be offensive to you personally, your taste in how Scripture is read,"" he said.

Stressing the importance of reading Scripture within the context ""of the lives people really lead,"" Berlin contrasted his own approach with fellow Methodists he claimed, ""believe that anytime someone does something that they disagree with strongly, they don't want to be in that church.""

""There are United Methodists who believe that if any gay couple is married in any Methodist church anywhere, they no longer want to be in the denomination,"" he said. ""And I suppose if that issue is that important to you, then probably the logical thing to do would be to go and leave and find a new place to be the church together.""

All the clerical sources who spoke to Fox News saw the fracture within the UMC as part of a larger battle over sexuality that has played out in every other mainline Protestant denomination in the United States. Several noted, however, that the Methodists are the last to face the split, a fact they attributed to its global nature, which allows conservative congregations in Africa, Asia and elsewhere to hold the traditionalist line.

MORE THAN 50 PEOPLE KILLED IN ‘VILE AND SATANIC’ ATTACK ON NIGERIAN CATHOLIC CHURCH

Ryan Danker, a church historian and director of the John Wesley Institute, noted that much of the liberalism in the UMC is confined to the United States and predicted that the conservative Methodist congregations splintering off will find themselves better aligned with Christians globally.

""Theological commitments, I think, are stronger now than denominational ones,"" Danker observed. ""Conservative Anglicans, Methodists and Presbyterians would have more in common than they would with progressives in their own denominations.""

Michigan adoption agency reverses LGBT policy,"A major faith-based foster care and adoption contractor for the state of Michigan said Monday it will place children in LGBT homes, reversing course following a recent legal settlement.

Grand Rapids-based Bethany Christian Services is responsible for about 8% of Michigan's more than 13,000 foster care and adoption cases involving children from troubled households.

""We are disappointed with how this settlement agreement has been implemented by the state government. Nonetheless, Bethany will continue operations in Michigan, in compliance with our legal contract requirements,"" the nonprofit said in a statement, confirming a policy change that was first reported by WGVU-FM.

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, a Democrat, announced the settlement last month with same-sex couples who had sued in 2017. It prevents faith-based agencies from refusing to place children in LGBT households for religious reasons if it has accepted them for referral from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services.

Lansing-based St. Vincent Catholic Charities challenged the deal in federal court last week, alleging violations of the U.S. Constitution and the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act.

Of the faith-based agencies known to not serve LGBT couples or individuals in Michigan, Bethany does the most work for the state. The nonprofit was handling 1,159 cases as of February. Catholic Charities had 404 cases, or 3%, while St. Vincent had 80, or less than 1%.

State human services department spokesman Bob Wheaton said the agency was pleased it will ""be able to continue its long-standing partnership with Bethany in providing services to children and families.""

Nessel tweeted over the weekend that having more adoption agencies not discriminate results in ""more children adopted into loving, nurturing 'forever' homes. Thank you to Bethany Christian Services.""

As a private attorney, Nessel — who is a lesbian — successfully fought to overturn Michigan's ban on gay marriage.

On April 11, Bethany's national board of directors voted to change the policy. It applies only in Michigan, not to its operations in other states. The policy change also does not impact private adoptions, according to Bethany.

A 2015 Republican-enacted law says child-placement agencies are not required to provide any services that conflict with their sincerely held religious beliefs. But Nessel's settlement says the law does not apply if agencies are under contract with the state.

In its lawsuit , St. Vincent said it fears the state will not renew its contract in October because of the local nonprofit's religious beliefs and practices.

""If St. Vincent is unable to receive referrals from or contract with the State, it will be forced to close its foster care and adoption programs, ending a decades-old religious ministry and reducing the number of agencies available to serve families and children in need,"" the agency said in the complaint.

Michigan library risks closing after voters pull funding over LGBT-themed books,"A public library in rural Michigan risks closing after the community voted to defund it following an outcry over its LGBT-themed books.

Township residents voted against a public funding measure for the Patmos Library in Jamestown Township, Michigan, earlier this month after it declined to remove certain books that detractors alleged were inappropriate for children, according to the Wall Street Journal.

Without the measure, which would have funded the library with local property taxes, it is slated to lose 85% of its annual $250,000 budget in 2023.

Jamestown Conservatives, a group leading the initiative to pull Patmos' funding, reportedly distributed fliers locally that claimed it was stocked with books replete with LGBT subject matter and ""pornographic sexually graphic material"" intended for ""very young and impressionable kids.""

TEXAS LIBRARY APOLOGIZES FOR INCLUDING CONSERVATIVE BOOK ON TRANSGENDER ISSUES IN ITS PRIDE MONTH DISPLAY

The flier also criticized a Pride display at the library and urged readers to pray for changes that would make it ""a safe and neutral place for our children.""

Among the books that drew the ire of some parents was ""Gender Queer: A Memoir,"" an award-winning 2014 graphic novel by Maia Kobabe, an author who uses e/em/eir pronouns.

AMAZON ACCUSED OF 'ABSURD AND UNACCPETABLE' CENSORSHIP AFTER BOOK QUESTIONING TRANSGENDER MOVEMENT VANISHES

According to an online listing for the book, ""Gender Queer"" is a ""cathartic autobiography [that] charts eir journey of self-identity, which includes the mortification and confusion of adolescent crushes, grappling with how to come out to family and society, bonding with friends over erotic gay fan fiction, and facing the trauma and fundamental violation of pap smears.""

""Started as a way to explain to eir family what it means to be nonbinary and asexual, Gender Queer is more than a personal story: It is a useful and touching guide on gender identity—what it means and how to think about it—for advocates, friends, and humans everywhere,"" the listing adds.

Other books that parents asked to have removed included ""Spinning"" and ""Kiss Number 8,"" young adult graphic novels about teenage girls coming to terms with their burgeoning lesbianism.

Amanda Ensing, one of the organizers of Jamestown Conservatives, said she hoped the funding measure's defeat would serve as a ""wake-up call,"" according to Bridge Michigan.

GOP SENATORS SEND LETTER TO JEFF BEZOS ASKING WHY AMAZON PULLED ‘WHEN HARRY BECAME SALLY’

Larry Walton, who serves as president of the library's board, said that Patmos Library may have to shutter after being stripped of its funding.

""A wake-up call to what?"" Walton asked in response to Ensing. ""To take LGBTQ books off the shelf, and then they will give us money? What do you call that? Ransom?""

""We stand behind the fact that our community is made up of a very diverse group of individuals, and we as a library cater to the diversity of our community,"" he said.

The Patmos Library Board met following the Aug. 2 vote and plans to have another funding initiative on the ballot for the general election in November, when board members expect more people to vote, according to Fox 17.

Mississippi can enforce LGBT religious objections law: court,"A federal appeals court said Thursday that Mississippi can enforce a law that allows merchants and government employees cite religious beliefs to deny services to same-sex couples, but opponents of the law immediately pledged to appeal.

A three-judge panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a judge’s decision that had blocked the law.

U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves had ruled that the law unconstitutionally establishes preferred beliefs and creates unequal treatment for LGBT people. His ruling prevented the law from taking effect last July.

The law does not take effect immediately. Plaintiffs are allowed time to appeal.

The 5th Circuit panel did not rule on whether the law is constitutional. It said plaintiffs failed to prove they would be harmed by the law, “but the federal courts must withhold judgment unless and until that plaintiff comes forward.”

Legal experts said the law, which started as House Bill 1523 , is the broadest religious-objections measure enacted by any state.

Championed and signed in 2016 by Republican Gov. Phil Bryant, it aims to protect three beliefs: marriage is only between a man and a woman; sex should only take place in such a marriage; and a person’s gender is determined at birth and cannot be altered. It would allow clerks to cite religious objections to recuse themselves from issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples, and would protect merchants who refuse services to LGBT people. It could affect adoptions and foster care, business practices and school bathroom policies.

Robert McDuff, an attorney for some of the people who sued to try to block the law, criticized the appeals court for saying plaintiffs had failed to show they would be harmed.

“People should not have to live through discrimination in order to challenge this obviously unconstitutional bill,” McDuff said.

Roberta Kaplan, an attorney who represented some of the other plaintiffs, said her clients have been harmed.

“The state communicated a message loudly and clearly with the passage of HB 1523: Only certain anti-LGBT beliefs will get the protection and endorsement of the state,” Kaplan said. “Under the logic of this opinion, it would be constitutional for the state of Mississippi to pass a law establishing Southern Baptist as the official state religion.”

Kaplan and McDuff said they will appeal the decision by the 5th Circuit panel. Kaplan said she will ask the entire 5th Circuit to reconsider the arguments; McDuff said he will either do that or appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.

McDuff said that when — or whether — the law will take effect depends on the outcome of the appeal.

Gay and straight plaintiffs who sued the state say the law gives “special protections to one side” in a religious debate.

Supporters say the law protects Mississippians’ rights to live out their faith.

“As I have said all along, the legislation is not meant to discriminate against anyone, but simply prevents government interference with the constitutional right to exercise sincerely held religious beliefs,” Bryant said Thursday.

Kevin Theriot (TAIR-ee-oh) is an attorney for Alliance Defending Freedom, an Arizona-based Christian group that helped to write the Mississippi law. He praised the appeals court decision.

“The sole purpose of this law is to ensure that Mississippians don’t live in fear of losing their careers or their businesses simply for affirming marriage as a husband-wife union,” Theriot said Thursday. “Those who filed suit have not and will not be harmed but want to restrict freedom and impose their beliefs on others by ensuring dissenters are left open to the government discrimination that has already occurred in states without protective laws like this one.”

Douglas NeJaime, a UCLA law professor, is faculty director of the Williams Institute, which researches issues dealing with sexual orientation, law and public policy. He testified in June 2016 on behalf of plaintiffs who sued to block the Mississippi religious objections law. NeJaime said Mississippi was the only state to enact a law that lists specific religious beliefs to be protected in reaction to the 2015 legalization of same-sex marriage.",https://www.foxnews.com/us/mississippi-can-enforce-lgbt-religious-objections-law-court,N/A
Mississippi city settles with LGBT group over pride parade,"A Mississippi city has agreed to pay attorneys' fees and proclaim support for LGBT rights to settle a lawsuit over its denial of permission for a gay pride parade.

Starkville Mayor Lynn Spruill tells the Commercial Dispatch that aldermen approved the agreement 4-1 Friday.

She says the city will pay $12,750, which includes fees for attorneys representing Starkville Pride, the group that sued. The city reversed course and issued the permit after the lawsuit.

About 2,500 people took part March 24 in Starkville's first-ever LGBT pride parade.

Spruill says the agreement requires her to issue proclamations supporting LGBT History Month in October and supporting equal citizenship under the law. She says she will also meet regularly with a liaison from the city's LGBT community, which she's ""certainly happy"" to do.

More LGBT issues loom as justices near wedding cake decision,"A flood of lawsuits over LGBT rights is making its way through courts and will continue, no matter the outcome in the Supreme Court's highly anticipated decision in the case of a Colorado baker who would not create a wedding cake for a same-sex couple.

Courts are engaged in two broad types of cases on this issue, weighing whether sex discrimination laws apply to LGBT people and also whether businesses can assert religious objections to avoid complying with anti-discrimination measures in serving customers, hiring and firing employees, providing health care and placing children with foster or adoptive parents.

The outcome of baker Jack Phillips' fight at the Supreme Court could indicate how willing the justices are to carve out exceptions to anti-discrimination laws; that's something the court has refused to do in the areas of race and sex.

The result was hard to predict based on arguments in December. But however the justices rule, it won't be their last word on the topic.

Religious conservatives have gotten a big boost from the Trump administration, which has taken a more restrictive view of LGBT rights and intervened on their side in several cases, including Phillips'.

""There is a constellation of hugely significant cases that are likely to be heard by the court in the near future and those are going to significantly shape the legal landscape going forward,"" said Shannon Minter, legal director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights.

Several legal disputes are pending over wedding services, similar to the Phillips case. Video producers, graphic artists and florists are among business owners who say they oppose same-sex marriage on religious grounds and don't want to participate in same-sex weddings. They live in the 21 states that have anti-discrimination laws that specifically include gay and lesbian people.

In California and Texas, courts are dealing with lawsuits over the refusal of hospitals, citing religious beliefs, to perform hysterectomies on people transitioning from female to male. In Michigan, the American Civil Liberties Union filed suit against the state's practice of allowing faith-based child placement agencies to reject same-sex couples.

Advocates of both sides see the essence of these cases in starkly different terms.

""What the religious right is asking for is a new rule specific to same-sex couples that would not only affect same-sex couples but also carve a hole in nondiscrimination laws that could affect all communities,"" said Camilla Taylor, director of constitutional litigation at Lambda Legal, which supports civil rights for LGBT people.

Jim Campbell of the Christian public interest law firm Alliance Defending Freedom said the cases will determine whether ""people like Jack Phillips who believe marriage is the union of a man and a woman, that they too have a legitimate place in public life. Or does he have to hide or ignore those beliefs when he's participating in the public square?"" ADF represents Phillips at the Supreme Court.

The other category of cases concerns protections for LGBT people under civil rights law. One case expected to reach the court this summer involves a Michigan funeral home that fired an employee who disclosed that she was transitioning from male to female and dressed as a woman.

The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the firing constituted sex discrimination under federal civil rights law. That court is one of several that have applied anti-sex discrimination provisions to transgender people, but the Supreme Court has yet to take up a case.

The funeral home argues in part that Congress was not thinking about transgender people when it included sex discrimination in Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. A trial judge had ruled for the funeral home, saying it was entitled to a religious exemption from the civil rights law.

""Congress has not weighed in to say sex includes gender identity. We should certainly make sure that's a conscious choice of Congress and not just the overexpansion of the law by courts,"" Campbell said. ADF also represents the funeral home.

In just the past week, two federal courts ruled in favor of transgender students who want to use school facilities that correspond to their sexual identity. Those cases turn on whether the prohibition on sex discrimination in education applies to transgender people. Appeals in both cases are possible.

In the past 13 months, federal appeals courts in Chicago and New York also have ruled that gay and lesbian employees are entitled to protection from discrimination under Title VII. Those courts overruled earlier decisions. Title VII does not specifically mention sexual orientation, but the courts said it was covered under the ban on sex bias.

The Obama administration had supported treating LGBT discrimination claims as sex discrimination, but the Trump administration has changed course. In the New York case, for instance, the Trump administration filed a legal brief arguing that Title VII was not intended to provide protections to gay workers. It also withdrew Obama-era guidance to educators to treat claims of transgender students as sex discrimination.

There is no appeal pending or expected on the sexual orientation issue, and there is no guarantee that the court will take up the funeral home's appeal over transgender discrimination.

The trend in the lower courts has been in favor of extending civil rights protections to LGBT employees and students. Their prospects at the Supreme Court may be harder to discern, not least because it's unclear whether the court's composition will change soon.

Justice Anthony Kennedy, 81, has been the subject of retirement speculation, though he has not indicated he is planning to retire. When Justice Stephen Breyer turns 80 in August, he will join Kennedy and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 85, as octogenarians on the bench.

If President Donald Trump were to replace any of those justices, the court probably would be much less receptive to LGBT rights. Even the landmark gay marriage ruling in 2015 that Kennedy wrote was a 5-4 decision.

""We're very concerned about the composition of the federal bench. Under the Trump administration, we've seen a number of federal nominees who have been ideologues, who have taken positions about the very right to exist of LGBT people that is simply inconsistent with fitness to serve as a federal judge,"" Taylor of Lambda Legal said.

The ADF's Campbell said even with the current justices, he holds out some hope that the court would not extend anti-discrimination protections. ""Justice Kennedy has undoubtedly been the person who has decided the major LGBT cases, but to my knowledge he hasn't weighed in some of these other issues,"" he said.",https://www.foxnews.com/us/more-lgbt-issues-loom-as-justices-near-wedding-cake-decision,N/A
Mormon church opposes LGBT nondiscrimination measure,"The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints announced its opposition Monday to a comprehensive nondiscrimination bill that faces long odds in Congress, saying the legislation doesn't ""meet the standard of fairness for all,"" contending it would strip key religious freedom protections.

The faith said in a statement that the Equality Act would ""threaten religious employment standards, devastate religious education, defund numerous religious charities."" The church pointed out the importance of religions and religious schools having the right to create faith-based employment and admissions standards.

The Southern Baptist Convention and the Roman Catholic Church are among others that oppose the measure.

""While providing extremely broad protections for LGBT rights, the Equality Act provides no protections for religious freedom,"" the statement said.

The legislation would add gender identity and sexual orientation to existing federal nondiscrimination laws covering such things as employment, housing, education, and public spaces and services.

The bill has widespread Democratic backing and seems certain to pass the House, but the chances appear slim in the Republican-controlled Senate.

The Utah-based faith, widely known as the Mormon church, said it favors ""reasonable"" measures to protect LGBT people's access to housing, employment and public accommodations, but that such efforts shouldn't erode the right for people to live and speak freely about their religious beliefs.

The religion has tried to stake out a more compassionate stance on LGBTQ people, while sticking firmly to its doctrinal opposition to gay marriage and same-sex intimacy.

The church points to a 2015 Utah anti-discrimination law it backed. That measure made it illegal to base employment and housing decisions on sexual orientation or gender identity, while also creating exemptions for religious organizations and protecting religious speech in the workplace.

The faith said the federal Equality Act doesn't strike the right balance.

It expressed concern ""that the ongoing conflicts between religious liberty and LGBT rights is poisoning our civil discourse, eroding the free exercise of religion and preventing diverse Americans of good will from living together in respect and peace.""

U.S. Sens. Mitt Romney and Mike Lee, Republicans from Utah, also oppose the legislation.

Lee said in a statement the proposal is ""seriously flawed"" and would ""dangerously undermine the First Amendment and the freedoms it was designed to protect."" Romney doesn't support the measure because it doesn't contain strong religious liberty protections that are ""essential"" to any legislation on the issue, said spokeswoman Arielle Mueller in an email.",https://www.foxnews.com/us/mormon-church-opposes-lgbt-nondiscrimination-measure,N/A

"Nike, Lebron and NBA silent as China's crackdown on LGBT community continues","Nike, the NBA, and star player LeBron James have remained silent on China's increasing hostility toward the LGBTQ community, most recently when one of the country's most prestigious universities cracked down on students displaying LGBTQ flags.

Fox News reached out to Nike, the NBA and Upland Workshop – an advisory company founded and led by James’ spokesman and advisor Adam Mendelsohn - for comment on the crackdown but did not receive a response.

The silence comes after two students at China's Tsinghua University were reprimanded for distributing LGBTQ rainbow flags, according to a report in Bloomberg. The students were given official warnings and were prohibited from receiving scholarships and awards for six months, with the school warning that further violations could result in the students facing more serious penalties such as losing eligibility for civil service and state-owned-enterprise jobs.

News of the punishment for the students went viral on Chinese social media, but the posts were quickly deleted on China's tightly-controlled internet. The incident was just the latest in China's apparent crackdown on the gay community in the country, with Chinese President Xi Jinping pushing for a more conservative approach to gender and sexual identity.

ENES KANTER EXCORIATES THE NBA, NIKE FOR NOT STANDING UP TO 'BIG BOSS' CHINA: 'BIGGEST HYPOCRITE COMPANIES'

""This incident is the latest example of university authorities increasingly constraining space for LGBT advocacy and expression – even when it is mild and lowkey,"" Darius Longarino, a senior fellow at Yale Law School’s Paul Tsai China Center, told Bloomberg.

James and the NBA have been vocal on a host of political and social issues in recent years, but have mostly turned a blind eye to Communist China's behavior on gender, sexual identity, and human rights abuses. Critics have largely panned the NBA and Nike in recent years over their ties to China, with the country representing a large new market audience for the professional basketball league and source of cheap labor for the shoe giant.

Former Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey, who currently works as the president of basketball operations of the Philadelphia 76ers, sparked controversy in 2019 when he took to Twitter to defend protesters in Hong Kong, encouraging followers to ""fight for freedom"" and ""stand with Hong Kong"" during China's crackdown in the independent administrative region.

The tweet, which was quickly deleted, created backlash in China and caused the NBA to lose valuable sponsorship dollars, even drawing a rebuke from James at the time.

But at times, there are ramifications for the negative that can happen when you’re not thinking about others and you’re only thinking about yourself,"" James said at the time.

North Carolina preschool uses LGBT flashcards depicting a pregnant man to teach kids colors,"A North Carolina preschool used flash cards featuring LGBTQ themes to teach kids colors, including one card depicting a pregnant man.

""Schools should only be using age-appropriate materials, and these flashcards clearly do not meet that standard for a pre-school classroom,"" Republican State Rep. Erin Paré said in a statement after being alerted to the cards by a constituent, according to North Carolina Speaker of the House Tim Moore.

Paré said a concerned constituent emailed her about the cards that were being used to teach preschoolers colors at Ballentine Elementary School in Wake County, NC. Paré then contacted the principal of the elementary school in an attempt to verify the use of the cards in class, with the principal taking ""swift action"" to investigate the constituents claims.

The principal was able to locate the cards in the preschool classroom and verify with the teacher that they had been used to teach colors, which the principal said was approved curriculum at the school. The principal took possession of the cards and alerted the district superintendent and human resources about the incident, which she said she was unaware of until being alerted to the situation by Paré.

""I am grateful that a concerned constituent reached out and that this issue is being addressed in a swift and professional manner by Ballentine Elementary School,"" Paré said.

The incident comes amid an effort in the North Carolina General Assembly to pass legislation aimed at giving parents more control over what their children are taught in school, including giving them the option to opt out of what they consider ""age-inappropriate classroom materials.""

In the meantime, Paré said the situation schools across the state should use the response of Ballentine Elementary as an example.

NYPD apologizes for 1969 Stonewall raid that birthed modern LGBT rights movement,"New York City's police commissioner apologized Thursday for the June 1969 raid on the Stonewall Inn gay bar, an event widely cited as the beginning of the modern LGBT rights movement.

“The actions taken by the NYPD were wrong, plain and simple,” NYPD Commissioner James O’Neill said during a briefing at police headquarters. ""The actions and the laws were discriminatory and oppressive, and for that, I apologize.”

EX-DELAWARE CITY COUNCILMAN ARRESTED AFTER STRIKING GAY PRIDE PARADE ORGANIZER WITH TRUCK

Organizers of New York City's LGBT Pride celebration had called for police to apologize for the raid on the Greenwich Villiage bar on the night of June 27-28, 1969, which saw bar patrons and others fight back against officers and a social order that kept gay life in the shadows. New York City Council Speaker Corey Johnson, who is gay, had also joined the calls for an apology.

“What happened should not have happened,” O’Neill said Tuesday. “This would never happen in the NYPD in 2019.”

The confrontation at the Stonewall wasn’t the first time LGBT people had protested or spontaneously clashed with police. But it proved to be a turning point, unleashing a wave of organizing and activism.

PHILIPPINES DUTERTE SAYS HE WAS ONCE GAY BUT 'CURED' HIMSELF AFTER MEETING EX-WIFE

At the time, many LGBT people lived in fear of arrest, harassment, professional ruin and family ostracism. The psychiatric establishment saw homosexuality as a mental disorder, and law enforcement often viewed it as a crime.

LGBT people could be subject to arrest for showing affection, dancing together, even for not wearing a certain number of items deemed gender-appropriate. Bars that served gay people had at times lost their liquor licenses, and others — like the Stonewall — were simply unlicensed. Raids were common.

Last week, New York City officials announced that transgender activists Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera will be commemorated with statues in Greenwich Village, for their role in the movement according to FOX 5 NY.

The police inspector who led the Stonewall raid, Seymour Pine, said in 2004 that he was sorry, according to news accounts of a talk he gave at the time. Pine, who died in 2010, said officers were prejudiced about gay people, whom they didn't understand.

NYPD leaders have expressed some regret before about the events at the Stonewall, but until Thursday, they stopped short of a formal apology.

Former Commissioner William Bratton in 2016 called it ""a terrible experience"" but noted that it had also been ""a tipping point"" for change. He said an apology was unnecessary: ""The apology is all that's occurred since then.""

When O'Neill was asked the next year about apologizing for Stonewall, he said it had ""been addressed already.""

Oklahoma governor signs adoption law opposed by LGBT groups,"Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin signed a bill late Friday that gay rights advocates say would allow religious-based adoption agencies to discriminate against same-sex couples, single people and non-Christians in placing children.

The bill written by Republican Sen. Greg Treat provides legal protections to faith-based agencies that won't place children in LGBT homes because of religious or moral convictions or policies.

Her decision outraged gay rights groups.

The Family Equality Council, which advocates for LGBTQ families, said in a statement that the Oklahoma law targets the gay community and encourages religious-based adoption agencies ""to discriminate on the basis of their belief that LGBTQ people should not be raising children.""

Freedom Oklahoma, another LGBT advocacy group, threatened to sue the state over the new law.

""Make no mistake, we will fight for the most vulnerable Oklahomans targeted by this law. Our message to Gov. Fallin and the lawmakers who championed this travesty is simple: We'll see you in court!"" said Executive Director Troy Stevenson.

But Fallin's action drew support from Oklahoma's Catholic bishops.

""The new law will bring more adoption services to the state and allow crucial faith-based agencies to continue their decades-long tradition of caring for Oklahoma's most vulnerable children,"" Oklahoma's Catholic bishops said in a statement.

Treat, the Senate majority floor leader and president pro tem designate, has said he's convinced some faith-based groups are hesitant to participate in adoptions for fear of being sued for discrimination.

""I would not be standing here on a bill as controversial as this if I didn't believe it would help more children to get into loving homes,"" Treat said during a sometimes testy debate near the end of the legislative session earlier this month. But gay rights groups disagreed, saying it would lead to fewer children being placed because some groups would exclude same sex homes from hosting them.

The new law goes into effect Nov. 1.",https://www.foxnews.com/us/oklahoma-governor-signs-adoption-law-opposed-by-lgbt-groups,N/A
"Oklahoma, Kansas approve religious veto on LGBT adoptions","State lawmakers in Oklahoma and Kansas have approved legislation to grant legal protections to faith-based adoption agencies that cite their religious beliefs for not placing children in LGBT homes.

Supporters of such measures argued that the core issue is protecting a group's right to live out its religious faith, while critics saw them as attacks on LGBT rights. Both Oklahoma and Kansas have GOP-controlled legislatures and governors, but in Kansas, the proposal split Republicans.

The Oklahoma House's 56-21 vote Thursday sent its measure to Gov. Mary Fallin, who has not said whether she would sign it. It's similar to laws in at least five other states.

Kansas legislators acted hours later. The state House approved, 63-58, a bill that would prevent faith-based agencies from being barred from providing foster care or adoption services for the state if they refuse to place children in homes violating their ""sincerely held"" religious beliefs. The Senate passed it, 24-15, early Friday morning.

Kansas Gov. Jeff Colyer supported his state's legislation, with his administration arguing that it would encourage faith-based groups to place more abused and neglected children in state custody.

Backers of the Kansas bill acknowledged that faith-based agencies have been operating in Kansas for decades without issue. But they fear that lawsuits or turnover among state officials could result in an environment hostile to some religious groups' views.

""This is a matter of activist groups who don't like certain religious beliefs and they want to use the power of the government to crush people that operate according to those religious beliefs,"" said Kansas Catholic Conference director Michael Schuttloffel said.

LGBT-rights advocates argue that enacting such a law would sanction discrimination and support it with taxpayer dollars.

TechNet, representing some of the biggest names in tech, including Apple and Google, sent a letter to lawmakers in both states opposing their measures. Critics in Kansas worried that it would make the state look backward and even suggested it could hurt the economy.

""If you care about jobs, vote no on this,"" said Rep. Brandon Whipple, a Wichita Democrat.

The Oklahoma bill cleared the GOP-controlled Legislature over the boisterous objections of Democrats. At one point, the chamber's presiding officer threatened to have a member forcibly removed.

Texas, Alabama, South Dakota, Virginia and Michigan already have such laws in place. Michigan's ACLU chapter took the state to court last year over its adoption law, and the case is still ongoing.

In 2011, Illinois declined to renew its state contract with Catholic Charities adoption services due to its policy of refusing child placement to same-sex couples. Catholic Charities has also stopped handling adoptions in Washington D.C., Massachusetts and San Francisco over concerns they would be required to act against their religious beliefs.

In Kansas, both sides of the debate agree that the state's foster care system is overloaded. The number of kids in need of homes has grown every year since 2008, from 5,711 to 7,540 as of March, according to the Department of Children and Families.

Supporters said that passing the measure could encourage groups providing limited services for the state or doing only private adoptions to work more with the state. Colyer's administration has said some out-of-state agencies could be attracted to Kansas.

In Oklahoma, sponsoring state Sen. Greg Treat, an Oklahoma City Republican, said he believes his measure will help get more children into loving homes.

""I believe this bill aids and gets more people involved in the system,"" he said.

But critics like Lori Ross, president of Foster Adopt Connect, a child placement agency operating in Kansas and Missouri, contend the real problem is a lack of available families.

Ross said for LGBT families looking to adopt, it isn't always obvious which agencies will work with them and which won't, she said. If they make that first phone call and get denied, they may never try and adopt again.

""If you're a single person, or a gay person, or a divorced person, or you're Jewish, then you better think twice before you call,"" Ross said.

PayPal scraps North Carolina expansion plan over state's LGBT law,"An economic backlash broadened Tuesday against a North Carolina law that critics say discriminates against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people with PayPal announcing it has canceled a major expansion in the state.

North Carolina has come under heavy criticism since Gov. Pat McCrory signed the law, requiring transgender people to use public bathrooms that match the sex on their birth certificates. The law, passed in response to a Charlotte ordinance that offered protections to gay and transgender people, also excludes sexual orientation and gender identity from the state's anti-discrimination law and bars local governments from expanding anti-discrimination rules.

More than 100 corporate leaders have decried the law, saying it is unfair and makes it more difficult to attract talent.

Just days before signing the law last month, McCrory personally attended PayPal's announcement that it was opening a new operation center in Charlotte, where he was once mayor. On Tuesday, the San Jose, California-based company said it was canceling the $3.6 million plan, which would have created 400 jobs.

""This decision reflects PayPal's deepest values and our strong belief that every person has the right to be treated equally, and with dignity and respect,"" the company said in a statement.

PayPal's announcement came days after Lionsgate decided to move the filming for the pilot episode of a comedy series to Canada. New Jersey-based Braeburn Pharmaceuticals also said it was reconsidering building a $50 million facility in Durham County projected to bring 50 jobs paying an average of $76,000 a year. The NBA raised doubts about whether it would continue plans to hold its all-star game in Charlotte next year.

But PayPal's decision isn't likely to lead to a wave of businesses fleeing the state, said Ryan McDevitt, a Duke University professor who studies how companies compete. Technology companies are particularly outspoken on social issues because they need to attract highly skilled and mobile employees while also appealing to younger customers, he said.

""They've built a lot of their brand or identity on the idea of being inclusive,"" McDevitt said. ""I think this law in particular goes against that, and so no one wants to be seen as implicitly endorsing it by locating in North Carolina now if a segment of their employees and many of their customers are going to be affected by it.""

One test of how upset some businesses may be comes in less than two weeks with the twice-a-year High Point Furniture Market, which brings 20,000 companies and about 75,000 people to the state. The market is responsible for about $5 billion in economic activity each year, organizers estimate.

A slow stream of buyers canceled trips to boycott the law, but few sellers have decided against coming, market spokeswoman Ashley Grigg said. The American Society of Interior Designers still plans its events at this year's market but said it will reassess its relationship next year if things don't change.

Red Ventures, a South Carolina-based sales and marketing company, is in the midst of a 500-job expansion in Charlotte. But the company ""will not move forward with hiring in North Carolina until we understand what is happening with"" the state law, spokeswoman Katie Zach said.

Red Ventures CEO Ric Elias said in a letter he has shifted his political support from McCrory to Attorney General Roy Cooper, a Democrat challenging McCrory in November. Elias and Cooper, who has said he would not defend the law against lawsuits, each issued statements calling for its repeal.

When asked about PayPal's move Tuesday, McCrory repeated earlier comments that he was open to improving the state law but said it was needed to counteract the Charlotte ordinance. The law's backers say it prevents men from molesting women in restrooms and locker rooms while claiming to be transgender. Opponents say that claim is bogus.

The law ""was to ensure that that expectation of privacy would remain in our high schools and our universities and our community colleges,"" McCrory said. ""For those who disagree with that basic norm, they have that decision to make.""

A group that supported the legislation said PayPal pulled out despite being promised millions in incentives. The North Carolina Values Coalition said in a statement that ""a company with its hands in the pockets of the taxpayers of North Carolina shouldn't insert itself into the bathroom policies of the state.""",https://www.foxnews.com/us/paypal-scraps-north-carolina-expansion-plan-over-states-lgbt-law,N/A

FLORIDA SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER TAKES ELEMENTARY SCHOOL STUDENTS ON FIELD TRIP TO GAY BAR: 'SO HONORED'

""We are taking the incident seriously in our ongoing investigation and follow-up actions. It is important to district administrators that the district has the trust and confidence of the community, and we realize that an incident such as this completely undermines that trust,"" the school wrote.

Video and other media alleging to be from the school has gone viral on social media. Fox News Digital could not independently verify the photos and videos attributed to the event.

The school also assured parents that an unnamed individual has been placed on administrative leave until the investigation is complete.

Plan with LGBT bans OK'd by United Methodist judicial panel,"The United Methodist Church's judicial council on Friday upheld major portions of a new plan that strengthens bans on same-sex marriage and ordination of LGBT pastors.

Conservatives welcomed the decision and said key elements of the policy, called the Traditional Plan, could begin taking effect in January. Among liberal and centrist opponents of the plan, there was dismay; one group, Reconciling Ministries Network, called for an upsurge of resistance.

The Traditional Plan was adopted in February on 438-384 vote by delegates at a special UMC conference in St. Louis. Most U.S.-based delegates opposed that plan and preferred LGBT-inclusive options, but they were outvoted by U.S. conservatives who teamed with most of the delegates from Methodist strongholds in Africa and the Philippines.

The nine-member judicial council, at the close of a four-day meeting in Evanston, Illinois, ruled that some aspects of the Traditional Plan — mostly related to enforcement of its rules — were unconstitutional under church law. But the council upheld the bulk of the plan, clearing the way for its implementation in January.

The Rev. Tom Lambrecht, general manager of the conservative Methodist magazine Good News, hailed the council's ruling as a ""strong affirmation"" of the Traditional Plan's core elements.

He suggested that Methodists opposed to the plan should start negotiating to leave the UMC and form a new denomination that would allow them to adopt LGBT-inclusive policies.

Opponents of the Traditional Plan will have a chance to overturn it at the UMC's next general conference in May 2020. But Lambrecht said he agreed with other analysts who predict the UMC's conservative bloc will be even stronger then.

An alliance of Traditional Plan opponents, calling themselves UMC-Next, has been holding meetings to discuss the best path forward for those who share their views.

Its leaders say one option would be for centrists and liberals to leave en masse to form a new denomination. Under another option, opponents of the Traditional Plan would stay in the UMC and resist from within, eventually convincing conservatives that they should be the faction that departs.

Lambrecht dismissed that possibility.

""We're not leaving,"" he said.

Formed in a merger in 1968, the United Methodist Church claims about 12.6 million members worldwide, including nearly 7 million in the United States. It is the largest mainline Protestant denomination in the U.S.

While other mainline denominations have embraced gay-friendly practices, the UMC still bans them, though acts of defiance by pro-LGBT clergy members have multiplied. Many have officiated same-sex weddings; others have come out from the pulpit.

Enforcement of the bans has been inconsistent; the Traditional Plan aspires to beef up discipline against those engaged in defiance.

Under rules upheld by the judicial council, bishops are prohibited from ordaining ""self-avowed homosexuals,"" while clerics who perform same-sex weddings could be suspended without pay for a first offense and ousted from the ministry for a second offense.

Under the ruling, individual churches could disaffiliate with the UMC if two-thirds of the church community agrees, and if the church meets certain financial requirements.

The Reconciling Ministries Network, which supports LGBT inclusion, called its supporters ""to repeatedly state your dissent, to support the work of resistance by United Methodist seminaries, to continue to write open letters and visibly be in solidarity with those on the margins.""

""We call upon the Church to repent of the sin of homophobia,"" it said. ""Now is the time to rise and resist.""

Many Traditional Plan opponents already are expressing their dissatisfaction. Some churches have raised rainbow flags in a show of LGBT solidarity; some are withholding dues payments to the UNC administration in protest.

The Human Rights Campaign, a national LGBTQ-rights group, said the judicial council's ruling ""is deeply disappointing for countless LGBTQ Methodists, including young people and their families, who are yearning for a welcoming church family.""",https://www.foxnews.com/us/plan-with-lgbt-bans-okd-by-united-methodist-judicial-panel,N/A
Pride and prejudice? Race tinges LGBT celebrations,"Gay pride marches in New York City, San Francisco and in between this weekend will have plenty of participants — and also protests directed at them from other members of the LGBT community, speaking out against what they see as increasingly corporate celebrations that prioritize the experiences of gay white men and ignore issues facing black and brown LGBT people.

The protests disrupted other pride events earlier this month. In Washington, D.C., the No Justice No Pride group blocked the parade route. In Columbus, Ohio, four people were arrested after a group set out to protest violence against minority LGBT people and the recent acquittal of a police officer in the shooting death of Philando Castile, a black man, during a traffic stop.

""Nobody wants to feel dropped in a community that prides itself on diversity,"" said Mike Basillas, one of the organizers of the planned New York City protest action by No Justice No Pride.

In Minneapolis, organizers of Sunday's Twin Cities Pride Parade initially asked the police department to limit participation following the acquittal of police officer Jeronimo Yanez in the death of Castile. But organizers changed their minds after meeting Thursday with Janee Harteau, the city's openly gay police chief who called the decision divisive and hurtful to LGBT officers.

On Friday, the organizers apologized and said they had neglected to consider other alternatives. They said the officers are welcome to march after all.

In Philadelphia, where racial relations in the LGBT community are beginning to mend after a year of community protests, the introduction of a rainbow flag — the traditional symbol of LGBT unity and diversity — that added black and brown stripes to represent blacks and Latinos has spilled over into a national debate.

The recent flare-up of racial tensions comes as no surprise to Isaiah Wilson, director of external affairs for the National Black Justice Coalition, one of the few national groups focused specially on black LGBT rights.

He said the broader LGBT-rights movement ""has been whitewashed"" — dominated to a large extent by white gay men.

""Black queer and trans folks have always been there, but our contributions have been devalued,"" Wilson said.

He said major LGBT-rights groups need to be frank in discussing the issue of racism, as well as recruiting and supporting nonwhite leaders.

""Until the mainstream LGBT groups address this, we're not going to move forward and you'll continue to see this pressure,"" Wilson said. ""In my opinion, the pressure is good — it has us talking.""

Shannon Minter, a white attorney who is the legal director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights, said LGBT people of color were justified in challenging racist aspects of the LGBT-rights movement.

""The real test will be, can the LGBT movement own up to its historic legacy of racism and evolve to be more accountable and inclusive of people of color?"" Minter, a transgender man, wondered. ""If not, then it will cease to be a major political movement.""

One reason for the tensions, according to some activists, is a racial divide when it comes to the LGBT-rights movement's agenda. For years, many national groups focused on legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide — a goal achieved in 2015. For many LGBT people of color, there continue to be more pressing issues, such as economic inequality, policing and incarceration.

""In a lot of places, we're just trying to survive,"" said Wilson.

That divide has led to controversy when attempts have been made to address race, as in Philadelphia. The city drew criticism last summer when activists raised concerns that the Gayborhood — the city's main gay enclave — discriminated against blacks. Gay blacks complained of dress codes banning Timberlands and sweatpants, of not being served in a timely manner at bars and of being stopped and asked for identification at clubs while white customers walked in unbothered.

In January, Philadelphia officials issued a report confirming longstanding racism in the Gayborhood and pledged to penalize businesses that did not make changes. Earlier this month, the city unveiled a new flag meant to be a more inclusive reflection of gay pride, with a black and brown stripe added to the existing rainbow motif. The flag's introduction stirred heated commentary from supporters as well as those who felt it was interjecting race unnecessarily.

Pride organizers around the country have taken steps to address the criticisms. In San Francisco, Sunday's pride event will be led by groups including the Bayard Rustin LGBT Club, SF Black Community Matters, African Human Rights, and Bay Area Queer People of Color. In New York City, the march organizers are putting a contingent of groups more focused on protest than celebration at the head of the event.

The LGBT community does need to confront these issues, said Michelle Meow, an Asian-American woman who is board president of San Francisco Pride, and ""the pride celebration is a platform for that dialogue to happen.""

New York City spokesman James Fallarino said if there are any disruptions or protests during the event, ""We're going to make sure we do everything in our power to respect the people who are disrupting or protesting and to respect their message.""

Prominent doc says LGBT opposition got him excised from hospital staff,"A prominent Boston doctor and Harvard Medical School professor says a prestigious hospital canned him because he refused to endorse the LGBT lifestyle, which he believes is dangerous and unhealthy.

Dr. Paul Church clashed with officials at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center for years over the issue, bitterly opposing the hospital's policy of promoting such events as Gay Pride Week and ""LGBT Achievement"" awards ceremonies. The hospital's stance ignored overwhelming evidence that practices common in the LGBT increase the risk of disease and mental illness, according to Church, a Cornell-trained urologist who worked at the hospital for 28 years.

""They chose a social agenda that they wanted to promote,"" said Church, who likened a hospital holding a gay pride event to the same institution organizing an event to promote cigarette smoking.

Church, 66, appeared to run out of options last month when the hospital's 25-member medical executive committee voted to expel him.

The hospital said in a statement to FoxNews.com that Church's behavior was ""inconsistent with BIDMC's established standards of professional conduct.""

""They chose a social agenda that they wanted to promote."" — Dr. Paul Church

""Because this is a medical staff credentialing matter, we do not plan to comment further,"" the statement said.

Church said he was wrongfully removed and that his performance and relationship with patients were never an issue. He acknowledged sending provocative emails to hospital officials, which he said were aimed at fostering dialogue but were met with hostility.

In one 2009 email -- in a response to a BIDMC’s 16th annual LGBT Achievement Award ceremony invitation -- Church citied evidence that he said is “irrefutable.”

“Behaviors common within the homosexual community are unhealthy and high risk for a host of serious medical consequences, including STDs, HIV and AIDS, anal cancer, hepatitis, parasitic intestinal infections, and psychiatric disorders,” his email said. “Life expectancy is significantly decreased as a result of HIV/AIDS, complications from the other health problems, and suicide.”

Church said he asked the hospital to stop sending him emails promoting LGBT culture and events, but he continued to receive them.

Some members of the hospital staff were apparently offended by Church's remarks, some of which cited Bible verses, and an investigation into Church was conducted.

Church said he believes medical institutions must treat all patients, but should not actively promote LGBT values.

Richard Mast, his lawyer at the Liberty Council, said Church is out of options to get his job back with the hospital, but the ruling does not prevent him from practicing medicine. Church is still affiliated with two other hospitals and he also is an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School. He said if there is additional “collateral damage” he intends to fight back.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s website, gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with other men have higher rates of HIV and STDs. For example, these men are 40 times more likely to be HIV-positive than heterosexual men.

“These numbers are not my opinion,” Church said.

Doctors nationwide have tried to find an effective approach for increasing communications between LGBT patients and physicians. The University of Washington conducted a study published in the American Journal of Public Health that showed heterosexual health care providers maintain an “implicit preference” to treat heterosexual patients.”

Dr. Sean Cahill, director of policy research at the Fenway Institute, a Boston-based organization that focuses on research and health issues involving the LGBT community, applauds any hospital’s attempt to reach out to a community that can feel a bias when it comes to medical care. He said it is important that hospitals continue outreach.

“I think it’s a welcome development,” he said. “Anytime you send a message of inclusion -- let’s say having a rainbow sticker at the front desk -- you are making someone feel more accepted.”

Cahill was not familiar with the Church issue, but said recent studies suggest that a number of gays, lesbians and transgender patients have reported a discriminatory experience when receiving medical care. He pointed to a 2013 Fenway Institute and Gay Men’s Health Crisis study in New York that found that 35 percent of participants at the House of Latex Ball experienced discrimination in health care because they identified as LGBT.

Church pointed to his long career and “compassionate” and “respectful care” of dozens of patients who self identify as members of the LGBT community. He said at least one of his gay patients wrote a letter on his behalf during the investigation.

“I approach every patient with the same kind of care and dignity,” he said.

Dr. Jane M. Orient, an internist in Arizona and executive director of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, has covered Church’s story and believes he was treated unfairly.

“From what I’ve read, the internal communication from Church has not been proven untrue,” she said. She said there is little doubt that gay sex between men has proven to be a risky lifestyle.

“It is not the role of a good doctor to lie to a patient and deny that there are inherent risks,” she said.",https://www.foxnews.com/us/prominent-doc-says-lgbt-opposition-got-him-excised-from-hospital-staff,N/A
Restaurant receives one-star Yelp review for hanging LGBT pride flag on storefront,"Patrons rallied around a restaurant owner in Massachusetts after he received a one-star Yelp review that focused on a small LGBT pride flag hanging in his storefront and barely mentioned anything else.

Nino Barbalace, the owner of Caffe Zia Gianna in Dorchester, always wanted his restaurant to be a welcoming place for all.

He recently noticed a one-star Yelp review and wondered what the customer was upset about.

In the review, which has since been taken down, the person said, “After seeing the rainbow flag in the window, I’ve had it with this place and have thrown in the towel…Well, that flag says all and when you delve deeper to see the real customer base here, it’s clearly geared and catered ONLY to those who rally behind the rainbow flag.”

“It was personal,” Barbalace told Boston 25. “If you go to a place and you’re not happy with the food or the service, I understand that if I made a mistake because we all make mistakes. This is a restaurant, not politics.”

The Yelp reviewer wrote that the food is “decent” but that he could “no longer accept patronizing this establishment.”

Yelp's content guidelines state that reviews ""aren't the place for rants about a business' employment practices, political ideologies, extraordinary circumstances, or other matters that don't address the core of the consumer experience.""

The restaurant owner, who was born in Italy, posted a screenshot of the Yelp review on Facebook and said “all are welcome at Zia Gianna, even this gentleman.”

His customers rallied around him.

“We thought we were beyond that at this point,” Tiffany Andrade, a customer, told the Boson Fox affiliate.

Andrade specifically came to the cafe Friday to show her support.

“Luckily we live in the land of the free and people are entitled to their own opinion, but I do think it’s something to understand that we are an open community and there are people who come from all different countries and all different backgrounds and we should be welcoming of everyone,” said Andrade.

“It’s unfortunate that some people are so small minded! Keep it up! You’re doing a great job and what a classy response to this ignorant jerk,” wrote another customer on Facebook.

Another wrote: “No one should have to deal with this. We love everyone there. You guys are great.”

Meanwhile, the LGBT pride flag remains and Barbalace said he’s willing to give the one-star reviewer a second chance.

Tennessee spikes bill allowing LGBT adoption refusals,"Tennessee lawmakers on Tuesday spiked a proposal that would have allowed faith-based adoption agencies to refuse to place children with gay parents and other families because of their religious beliefs.

The bill had been scheduled to be debated by the GOP-dominant Senate. However, at the last minute, the sponsor quietly asked for the proposal to be taken up next legislative session — essentially killing it for the year. There was no debate or explanation why the bill with withdrawn.

Supporters had argued the bill was needed to protect against potential lawsuits hostile to an adoption group's religious beliefs. However, opponents countered the measure would give adoption agencies free reign to discriminate against LGBT families, single parents and non-Christians.

Tuesday's developments came as national advocates have raised concerns about a series of Tennessee bills this session that they argue discriminate against LGBTQ individuals, including the adoption proposal and another to prevent government agencies from considering a business's nondiscrimination policies when selecting a contract.

Notably, Amazon joined a growing a list of major companies urging the Tennessee General Assembly to avoid bills that negatively impact LGBTQ individuals. Over the weekend, the Tennessee Titans announced they also opposed the slate of bills facing national scrutiny, warning that Nashville could risk hosting another NFL Draft — like the one held recently — if the measures were to become law.

Meanwhile, music superstar Taylor Swift donated $113,000 to the Tennessee Equality Project to fight the bills critics say discriminate against LGBTQ people. In a handwritten letter explaining the donation, Swift praised religious leaders who had opposed the anti-LGBTQ bills and were ""standing up against the 'Slate of Hate' in our state legislature.""

While the Senate pulled back the adoption bill, the chamber did advance a watered-down proposal to spell out that Tennessee's public indecency law applies to single-sex, multiperson bathrooms and changing rooms. While the bill had been significantly amended, critics argues there's still risk the bill could be misused to arrest transgender people.",https://www.foxnews.com/us/tennessee-spikes-bill-allowing-lgbt-adoption-refusals,N/A
The Latest: Kansas approves adoption bill seen as anti-LGBT,"The Latest on bills in Oklahoma and Kansas to protect faith-based adoption agencies that won't place children in LGBT homes (all times local):

1:55 a.m.

Kansas lawmakers have joined their counterparts in Oklahoma in passing legislation to grant legal protections to faith-based adoption agencies that won't place children in LGBT homes.

The Kansas Senate approved a bill early Friday that would prevent agencies from being barred from providing adoption services for the state if they refuse to place children in homes violating their religious beliefs.

The vote was 24-15. The House approved it earlier on 63-58 vote. It goes next to Republican Gov. Jeff Colyer, who supports it.

In Oklahoma, the state House approved similar legislation on a 56-21 vote Thursday and sent it to GOP Gov. Mary Fallin.

Supporters argued that the measures would protect the right of adoption agencies to follow their religious beliefs. Critics said they would sanction taxpayer-funded discrimination.

Kansas lawmakers are close to joining their counterparts in Oklahoma in passing legislation to grant legal protections to faith-based adoption agencies that won't place children in LGBT homes.

The Kansas House approved a bill Thursday that would prevent agencies from being barred from providing adoption services for the state if they refuse to place children in homes violating their religious beliefs.

The vote was 63-58. The Senate also had to vote on it, but its approval was expected because senators approved another version of the bill in March.

Republican Gov. Jeff Colyer's administration supports it.

In Oklahoma, the state House approved similar legislation on a 56-21 vote Thursday and sent it to GOP Gov. Mary Fallin.

Supporters viewed both measures religious freedom initiatives. Critics said they would sanction taxpayer-funded discrimination.

The Oklahoma House has given final approval to a bill that would grant legal protections to faith-based adoption agencies that don't want to place children in homes with same-sex couples.

The House voted 56-21 on Thursday for the bill over the boisterous objections of Democrats, who tried several parliamentary maneuvers to derail it. At one point, the presiding officer in the House threatened to have a member forcibly removed.

The bill would protect child-placing agencies that block adoptive parents who do not meet the agencies' religious or moral standards. It now heads to Republican Gov. Mary Fallin, who hasn't indicated if she would sign it.

The vote in Oklahoma comes as Republican legislators in Kansas are trying to break a political stalemate over a similar measure.

Republican legislators in Kansas are trying to break a political stalemate over a bill granting legal protections to faith-based adoption agencies that won't place children in LGBT homes.

House and Senate negotiators Thursday drafted a new version of a bill that would prevent the state from barring agencies from providing adoption services if they refuse to place children in homes violating their religious beliefs.

The Senate passed an earlier version in March but it has stalled in the House. Supporters hoped both chambers could vote on the new version Thursday, with the House going first.

The debate in Kansas occurred as Oklahoma legislators considered a similar proposal.

Trump tweets in support of LGBT people to mark Pride Month,"President Donald Trump is tweeting in support of LGBT people to mark LGBT Pride Month. His tweets come one week after his administration moved to revoke newly won health care discrimination protections for transgender people.

That move was the latest in a series of actions by the Trump administration that aim to reverse gains by LGBTQ Americans in areas including the military, housing and education.

In his tweets Friday, Trump says he wants to ""recognize the outstanding contributions LGBT people have made to our great Nation.""

The president says other nations ""punish, imprison or even execute individuals on the basis of sexual orientation."" He says the U.S. has a ""global campaign to decriminalize homosexuality.""

United Methodist Church on edge of breakup over LGBT stand,"The United Methodist Church teetered on the brink of breakup Monday after more than half the delegates at an international conference voted to maintain bans on same-sex weddings and ordination of gay clergy.

Their favored plan, if formally approved, could drive supporters of LGBT inclusion to leave America's second-largest Protestant denomination.

A final vote on rival plans for the church's future won't come until Tuesday's closing session, and the outcome remains uncertain. But the preliminary vote Monday showed that the Traditional Plan, which calls for keeping the LGBT bans and enforcing them more strictly, had the support of 56 percent of the more than 800 delegates attending the three-day conference in St. Louis.

The primary alternative proposal, called the One Church Plan, was rebuffed in a separate preliminary vote, getting only 47 percent support. Backed by a majority of the church's Council of Bishops in hopes of avoiding a schism, it would leave decisions about same-sex marriage and ordination of LGBT clergy up to regional bodies and would remove language from the church's law book asserting that ""the practice of homosexuality is incompatible with Christian teaching.""

Monday's voting did not kill the One Church Plan but makes its prospects on Tuesday far more difficult.

As evidence of the deep divisions within the faith, delegates Monday approved plans that would allow disaffected churches to leave the denomination while keeping their property.

""This is really painful,"" said David Watson, a dean and professor at United Theological Seminary in Dayton, Ohio, who was at the gathering. ""Our disagreement has pitted friend against friend, which no one wanted.""

Formed in a merger in 1968, the United Methodist Church claims about 12.6 million members worldwide, including nearly 7 million in the U.S. While other mainline Protestant denominations, such as the Episcopal and Presbyterian (U.S.A.) churches, have embraced the two gay-friendly practices, the Methodist church still officially bans them, even though acts of defiance by pro-LGBT clergy have multiplied and talk of a possible breakup has intensified.

The strong showing for the Traditional Plan reflects the fact that the UMC, unlike other mainstream Protestant churches in the U.S., is a global denomination. About 43 percent of the delegates in St. Louis are from abroad, mostly from Africa, and overwhelmingly support the LGBT bans.

""We Africans are not children in need of Western enlightenment when it comes to the church's sexual ethics,"" the Rev. Jerry Kulah, dean at a Methodist theology school in Liberia, said in a speech over the weekend. ""We stand with the global church, not a culturally liberal church elite in the U.S.""

The Africans have some strong allies among U.S. conservatives, including the Rev. John Miles II, senior pastor of First United Methodist Church in Jonesboro, Arkansas, who opposes same-sex marriage and gays in the pulpit.

""I have a very difficult time even though I have gays in my family and in my church,"" he said. ""I know it grieves them and it grieves me to grieve them. But it's just what we believe is the truth.""

In recent years, the church's enforcement of its LGBT bans has been inconsistent. Some clergy members have conducted same-sex marriages or come out as gay from the pulpit. In some cases, the church has filed charges against clergy who violated the bans, yet the denomination's Judicial Council has ruled against the imposition of mandatory penalties, which typically called for an unpaid suspension of at least one year.

The Traditional Plan would require stricter and more consistent enforcement.

Among the outspoken supporters of the more permissive One Church Plan was the Rev. Adam Hamilton, a pastor in Leawood, Kansas, who said it offered a way for Methodists ""to live together — conservatives, centrists and progressives — despite our differences.""

For LGBT Methodists, it is a time of anxiety.

""For me it's about who's in God's love, and nobody's left out of that,"" said Lois McCullen Parr, 60, a church elder from Albion, Michigan, who identifies as bisexual and queer. ""The Gospel I understand said Jesus is always widening the circle, expanding the circle, so that everyone's included.""

United Methodists confront possible split over LGBT issues,"The United Methodist Church's top legislative assembly convenes Sunday for a high-stakes, three-day meeting likely to determine whether America's second-largest Protestant denomination will fracture due to divisions over same-sex marriage and the ordination of gay clergy.

While other mainline Protestant denominations — such as the Episcopal and Presbyterian (U.S.A.) churches — have embraced gay-friendly practices, the Methodist church still bans them, even though acts of defiance by pro-LGBT clergy have multiplied and talk of a possible breakup of the church has intensified.

At the church's upcoming General Conference in St. Louis, 864 invited delegates — split evenly between lay people and clergy — are expected to consider several plans for the church's future. Several Methodist leaders said they expect a wave of departures from the church regardless of the decision.

""I don't think there's any plan where there won't be some division, and some people will leave,"" said David Watson, a dean and professor at United Theological Seminary in Dayton, Ohio, who will be attending the conference.

Formed in a merger in 1968, the United Methodist Church claims about 12.6 million members worldwide, including nearly 7 million in the United States. In size, it trails only the Southern Baptist Convention among U.S. Protestant denominations.

The church technically forbids same-sex marriage and gays serving in the ministry, but enforcement has been inconsistent. Clergy who support LGBT rights have been increasingly defiant, conducting same-sex marriages or coming out as gay or lesbian from the pulpit. In some cases, the church has filed charges against clergy who violated the bans, yet the UMC's Judicial Council has ruled against the imposition of mandatory penalties.

At the heart of the ideological conflict is an official UMC policy, dating from 1972, asserting that ""the practice of homosexuality is incompatible with Christian teaching.""

One of the proposed plans, endorsed by the UMC's Council of Bishops, would remove that language from the church's law book and leave decisions about same-sex marriage and ordination of LGBT clergy up to regional bodies. This proposal, called the One Church Plan, would open up many options for those who support the LGBT-inclusive practices, but it would not compel individual churches or clergy to engage in those practices.

In contrast, the proposed Traditional Plan would affirm the bans on same-sex marriage and the ordination of ""self-avowed practicing homosexuals."" The plan would strengthen enforcement of those bans, and set up procedures for churches and regional bodies to leave the UMC if they could not abide by those rules.

A third option would create three branches of the church reflecting the different approaches to LGBT issues. One branch would maintain the current bans, another would expect all its clergy and regional groups to support full LGBT inclusion, and the third would neither forbid nor require the inclusive practices. This plan would take several years longer to implement than the others.

Those three plans were developed over 17 months of deliberations by a Methodist committee that was formed after conflict over LGBT policies boiled over at a General Conference in 2016. In accordance with Methodists' long tradition of democratic policy-making, delegates in St. Louis will be free to revise any of those plans, or consider some alternative. The UMC's Queer Clergy Caucus will be presenting what it calls ""the Simple Plan"" — which is even more LGBT-affirming than the One Church Plan.

Kenneth Carter, the Florida-based president of the Council of Bishops, is among a majority of the bishops supporting the One Church Plan, hoping it would limit any exodus by creating space for differing views on the LGBT issues.

""We're better together than we are separated and fragmented, but I do understand that the forces that would separate us are very powerful,"" Carter said.

""We've tried to remain together as a global body,"" he added. ""The challenge is simply that there are some nations where homosexuality is taboo.""

Among the supporters of the Traditional Plan is Mark Tooley, who heads a conservative Christian think tank, and has long engaged in the debate over Methodist policy.

He believes a traditionalist alliance of U.S.-based and overseas delegates will be large enough to outvote centrist and liberal delegates.

Unlike other mainline Protestant churches, the UMC is a global denomination; its greatest growth recently has been overseas. About 30 percent of the delegates in St. Louis will be from Africa — a bloc with relatively conservative views on sexuality that in the past has supported the LGBT bans.

If the Traditional Plan does prevail, Tooley says some liberal segments of the church — perhaps its Western U.S. district — might withdraw to form a new denomination.

""It would be very significant,"" Tooley said.

UMC leaders are acutely aware of how searing the lengthy ideological conflict has been. In December, the Council of Bishops issued a pastoral letter expressing remorse that the buildup to the St. Louis meeting has been hurtful to many LGBT people.

""Demeaning and dehumanizing comments and attacks on LGBTQ persons in conversations related to the upcoming February Conference are a great tragedy and do violence to hearts, minds, and spirits,"" the letter said. ""We commit ourselves to helping people who disagree with each other to have conversations that include, honor, and respect people with different convictions.""

A localized example of the church's internal divisions has surfaced in San Francisco, home to the liberal Glide Memorial United Methodist Church, which has 12,000 members.

The UMC's California-Nevada conference removed two of Glide's pastors last summer, then filed a lawsuit in December seeking to assert control over the local church property. A Glide spokesman, Sam Singer, said the regional authorities were displeased with Glide's ""open door policy"" — which includes a variety of social-service programs for the needy and extensive outreach to the local LGBT community.

One of Glide's former senior pastors is Karen Oliveto, who — after eight years at Glide — was elected by the Rocky Mountain regional body in 2016 as the UMC's first openly lesbian bishop and is now based in Colorado. The UMC's judicial council upheld the election result, while ruling that Oliveto's 2014 marriage to a woman violated UMC policies for its clergy.

Oliveto hopes the delegates in St. Louis vote to end the LGBT bans; she's unsure what would ensue if the Traditional Plan prevails.

""What that means for us, I don't know,"" she said. ""I'll be praying very deeply.""

United Methodists edge toward breakup over LGBT policies,"There's at least one area of agreement among conservative, centrist and liberal leaders in the United Methodist Church: America's largest mainline Protestant denomination is on a path toward likely breakup over differences on same-sex marriage and ordination of LGBT pastors.

The differences have simmered for years, and came to a head in February at a conference in St. Louis where delegates voted 438-384 for a proposal called the Traditional Plan, which strengthens bans on LGBT-inclusive practices. A majority of U.S.-based delegates opposed that plan and favored LGBT-friendly options, but they were outvoted by U.S. conservatives teamed with most of the delegates from Methodist strongholds in Africa and the Philippines.

Many believe the vote will prompt an exodus from the church by liberal congregations that are already expressing their dissatisfaction over the move.

UNITED METHODIST DELEGATES REJECT RECOGNIZING GAY MARRIAGE, THREATENING SPLIT IN CHURCH

Some churches have raised rainbow flags in a show of LGBT solidarity. Some pastors have vowed to defy the strict rules and continue to allow gay weddings in Methodist churches. Churches are withholding dues payments to the main office in protest, and the UMC's receipts were down 20 percent in March, according to financial reports posted online.

""It's time for some kind of separation, some kind of amicable divorce,"" said James Howell, pastor of Myers Park United Methodist Church in Charlotte, North Carolina, who posted a video assailing the proposal for its ""real meanness.""

The UMC's nine-member Judicial Council convenes a four-day meeting in Evanston, Illinois, on Tuesday to consider legal challenges to the Traditional Plan. If the plan is upheld, it would take effect for U.S. churches on Jan. 1. If parts of it are struck down, that would likely trigger new debate at the UMC's next general conference in May 2020.

The UMC's largest church — the 22,000-member Church of the Resurrection with four locations in the Kansas City area — is among those applying financial pressure. Its lead pastor, Adam Hamilton, says his church is temporarily withholding half of the $2.5 million that it normally would have paid to the UMC's head office at this stage of the year.

""We'll ultimately pay it,"" Hamilton said. ""But we want to show that this is the impact if our churches leave.""

Hamilton is among the opponents of the Traditional Plan leading an initiative dubbed UMC-Next that seeks the best path forward for those who share their views. Clergy and activists in the alliance have met in Texas and Georgia, and a bigger meeting is planned for May 20-22 at Hamilton's megachurch.

Hamilton, in a telephone interview, said two main options are under consideration.

COLOMBIANS STAGE KISS-A-THON IN SUPPORT OF LGBT RIGHTS

Under one scenario, many centrists and liberals would leave en masse to form a new denomination — a potentially complex endeavor given likely disputes over the dissolution process.

Under the other option, opponents of the Traditional Plan would stay in the UMC and resist from within, insisting on LGBT-inclusive policies and eventually convincing the conservatives that they should be the faction that leaves under what's envisioned as a financially smooth ""gracious exit.""

""There's a sense that some conservatives have been wanting to leave for a long time,"" Hamilton said. ""They're tired of fighting about it.""

Formed in a merger in 1968, the United Methodist Church claims about 12.6 million members worldwide, including nearly 7 million in the United States.

While other mainline Protestant denominations have embraced gay-friendly practices, the UMC still bans them, though acts of defiance by pro-LGBT clergy have multiplied. Many have performed same-sex weddings; others have come out as gay or lesbian from the pulpit.

Enforcement of the bans has been inconsistent; the Traditional Plan aspires to beef up discipline against those engaged in defiance.

Traditional Plan supporter Mark Tooley, who heads a conservative Christian think tank, predicts that the UMC will split into three denominations — one for centrists, another oriented toward liberal activists and a third representing the global alliance of U.S. conservatives and their allies overseas.

""It's a question of how long it takes for that to unfold — and of who and how many go into each denomination,"" Tooley said. ""A lot of churches will be irreparably harmed as they divide.""

Scott Jones, bishop of the UMC's Houston-based Texas conference, says churchgoers in his region are divided in their views, but a majority supports the Traditional Plan's concepts.

""I have urged all of us to love each other, listen to each other and respect each other, even if we disagree,"" said Jones, who holds out hope that the UMC's disparate factions can preserve some form of unity.

Ann Craig of Newburgh, New York — a lesbian activist who has advocated for greater LGBT inclusion in the UMC — thinks a breakup can be avoided, though she's unsure what lies ahead.

""We expect something new to happen, but what that change should be or will be has not jelled yet,"" she said. ""I don't think we're going to break up — it's so cumbersome to figure out a way to divorce.""

The crisis is being followed closely at Methodist-affiliated theology schools based at universities with LGBT-inclusive policies. There are 13 UMC-connected theology schools around the country.

""There's a lot of turmoil and distress,"" said Mary Elizabeth Moore, dean of Boston University School of Theology. ""We're trying to find a future that will be less destructive than where we are now.""",https://www.foxnews.com/us/united-methodists-edge-toward-breakup-over-lgbt-policies,N/A

US Supreme Court is asked to block Mississippi LGBT law,"Advocates of same-sex marriage are asking the U.S. Supreme Court to strike down a new Mississippi law that lets government workers and business people cite their own religious objections to refuse services to LGBT people.

An appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court was filed within hours of when the law took effect Tuesday. Legal experts say it's the broadest religious-objections law enacted by any state since the nation's high court legalized same-sex marriage nationwide in 2015.

The law was championed and signed by Republican Gov. Phil Bryant in 2016, but the law had been on hold amid federal court challenges. It protects three beliefs: that marriage is only between a man and a woman, sex should only take place in such a marriage, and a person's gender is determined at birth and cannot be altered.

In an appeal Tuesday to the Supreme Court, attorneys for some of the gay and straight Mississippi residents who sued the state wrote that the law ""is a transparent attempt to undermine the equal dignity of LGBT citizens established in this court's decisions,"" starting with a 2003 decision that struck down a Texas law against sodomy and continuing to the 2015 decision that effectively legalized same-sex marriage.

""It is an equally transparent attempt to endorse particular religious beliefs as state policy,"" wrote the attorneys from the national gay-rights group Lambda Legal Defense & Education Fund and the Mississippi Center for Justice.

It was not immediately clear whether the Supreme Court would consider the appeal.

The Mississippi law allows clerks to cite religious objections to recuse themselves from issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples, and protects merchants who refuse services to lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender people. It could affect adoptions and foster care, business practices and school bathroom policies. Opponents say it also allows pharmacies to refuse to fill birth control prescriptions for unmarried women.

The Supreme Court will hear a case this term about a Colorado baker who said he should not be forced to violate his own religious beliefs by making a cake for a married same-sex couple. President Donald Trump's administration is supporting the baker, who disagreed with a Colorado law that bars discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. The Mississippi law affects actions by government workers and people working for private businesses.

An Arizona-based Christian group, Alliance Defending Freedom, helped write the Mississippi law. Bryant said Oct. 2 that ""this law was democratically enacted and is perfectly constitutional.""

U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves blocked the Mississippi law from taking effect in July 2016, ruling it unconstitutionally establishes preferred beliefs and creates unequal treatment for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.

A panel of judges from the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals lifted the hold on the law June 22, saying people who sued the state had failed to show they would be harmed. Plaintiffs asked the whole appeals court to reverse that decision, but the court said Sept. 29 that it would not do so. That opened the way for the law to take effect in Mississippi.

The 5th Circuit handles appeals from Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas and is considered one of the most conservative federal appeals courts. Opponents of the law wrote in their appeal to the Supreme Court that the 5th Circuit decision conflicts with decisions from other federal appeals courts and ""it has staggering implications.""

""Under the (appeals) court's reasoning, a state could enact a statute establishing Christianity — or any other religion — as the official religion of the state, and no plaintiff would have standing to challenge that statute,"" the opponents' attorneys wrote. They noted that ""numerous"" bills similar to Mississippi's have been introduced in other state legislatures.

Utah's Hatch urges support for LGBT youth in Senate speech,"Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch called for unwavering love and support for LGBT youth who experience high suicide rates as victims of bullying, discrimination and family estrangement in a somewhat surprising Senate speech this week from the retiring Republican who has long been an opponent of same-sex marriage.

Hatch said Wednesday that the suicide epidemic is especially acute among LGBT teens as he spoke in favor of a proposal that would create a national suicide prevention hotline.

""No one should ever feel less because of their gender identity or sexual orientation,"" said Hatch, according to a recording of the speech. ""LGBT youth deserve our unwavering love and support. They deserve our validation and the assurance that not only is there a place for them in this society, but that it is far better off because of them.""

Hatch last week applauded the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in favor of a Colorado baker who refused to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple. In 1988, he called the Democratic Party the ""the party of homosexuals"" in a derisive comment he later said he regretted.

In recent years, however, he's begun to carve out a more sympathetic position toward gays, lesbians and transgender people that's similar to the tone now taken by leaders of his religion, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The Utah-based religion of 16 million worldwide members has held firm to its opposition of gay marriage and homosexual activity while trying to foster an empathetic stance toward LGBTQ people.

Last year, Hatch defended transgender people after President Donald Trump Tweeted that he would not ""accept or allow"" transgender people to serve in the U.S. military.

""These young people need us — and we desperately need them,"" Hatch said Wednesday. ""We need their light to illuminate the richness and diversity of God's creations. We need the grace, beauty and brilliance they bring to the world.""

His remarks come a week after a new report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that suicide rates inched up in nearly every U.S. state from 1999 through 2016.

In Utah, the number of yearly suicides for youth ages 10 to 17 has spiked to alarming levels in the last five years — more than double the average from the previous decade.

Troy Williams, executive director of the LGBT support group Equality Utah, said it was heartening to hear a senior GOP leader speaking out in support of inclusion for gay, lesbian and transgender youth. He said Hatch has been fair-minded on LGBT issues for some time, but said the speech was unlike anything the senator had previously said.

""It's a tremendous evolution,"" Williams said. ""I believe his heart has been moved.""

Hatch said people should not just ""tolerate, but love,"" no matter if a person is a religious conservative or secular liberal. LGBT youth deserve acceptance for who they are, which he said wasn't a choice but how they were born.

""If there were ever a time to show our LGBT friends just how much we love them, it is now in a world where millions suffer in silence,"" Hatch said. ""We owe it to each other to love loudly.""",https://www.foxnews.com/us/utahs-hatch-urges-support-for-lgbt-youth-in-senate-speech,N/A

In the post, congresswoman Päivi Räsänen, a Christian Democrat, criticized the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland for participating in the Helsinki LGBT Pride events in June. Her criticism was alongside a picture of Romans 1:24-27 that describes same-sex relationships as ""shameful.""

FOUNDER OF CONVERSION THERAPY ORGANIZATION COMES OUT AGAINST IT: 'I WAS WRONG!'

Her post made Räsänen the subject of a pretrial investigation by the Finnish Police for a suspected incitement against sexual and gender minorities.

“The pre-trial investigations have not yet been completed. Police will provide more details once the investigations have been completed or presented to a prosecutor for consideration of charges,"" the Helsinki Police Department officer in charge of the investigation told the Helsinki Times.

Räsänen, who is a member of and is married to a pastor in the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland (ELCF), came under fire for her June Facebook post: ""How can the church's doctrinal foundation, the Bible, be compatible with the lifting up of shame and sin as a subject of pride? #LGBT #HelsinkiPride2019.""

The vast majority, 69 percent, of Finns are members of the ELCF, which has had a steady decline over the last few years, according to Evangelical Focus.

AN UNLIKELY JOURNEY FROM AGNOSTIC GAY MAN IN PRISON TO EVANGELICAL BIBLE PROFESSOR

In mid-August, the Finnish politician tweeted: “I am not concerned on my part, as I trust this will not move on to the prosecutor. However, I am concerned if quoting the Bible is considered even ‘slightly’ illegal. I hope this won't lead to self-censorship among Christians. Rom. 1:24–27.""

Räsänen's minority party holds five seats in the 200-seat Finnish Parliament. She is known for her defense of traditional Christian views on abortion and marriage, but after being called ""homophobic,"" the politician tweeted: ""It is not right to label Christian conviction as phobia.""

Catholic leaders enter final week of debate on how to receive LGBT churchgoers,"Over the past three weeks, Catholic bishops have dissected and debated an array of flashpoint issues impacting young Catholics, and this week are slated to wrap up one of the most divisive: how the church should receive those within the gay and broader LGBT community.

The 25-day synod of bishops will end this week with the adoption of a final document, as voted on by the 26 bishops, priests and cardinals from all over the world, along with a letter directed to the Catholic youth surmising decisions made.

Prior to the synod, a number of youth delegates mandated that the highly-anticipated document convey an exclusive message. The Vatican seemingly embraced that possibility in its preemptory document, acknowledging “LGBT” – which stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender – for the first time in its history.

Nonetheless, the issue remains subject to fierce debate within the Church leadership.

While some top brass is supportive of the language use, including Papua New Guinea Cardinal John Ribat who noted at a press conference Saturday that “the youth are talking about it freely” and they are “encouraging us” to “call us, address us as this because this is who we are,” others are more firmly opposed.

Philadelphia Archbishop Charles Chaput asserted his speech, according to the Associated Press, that “there is no such thing as an ‘LGBTQ Catholic’ or a ‘transgender Catholic’ or a ‘heterosexual Catholic,’ as if our sexual appetites defined who we are.”

Islamic group chief calls for Muslims to join Christians, Jews in Jerusalem meeting

Prior to the synod of bishops, a coalition of religious and LGBT activists launched an online campaign Equalfuture2018.com to raise “awareness of the damage done to children when they feel that being LGBT would be a misfortune or a disappointment.”

The activist site states that “Catholic Church leaders need to consider the role that the Church’s teaching on LGBT has had in giving children and young people the feeling that being LGBT would be a misfortune or a disappointment” and urged youth to contact their delegates in advance of the meeting to share their views.

Since Pope Francis uttered the phrase “who am I to judge?” in a July 2013 reference to gay Catholics, the comment has been viewed as a milestone moment and a potent break from tradition within the Church – igniting both commendation and criticism.",https://www.foxnews.com/world/catholic-leaders-enter-final-week-of-debate-on-how-to-receive-lgbt-churchgoers,N/A
"Christian charity worker faces potential jail time, fine after speaking about leaving LGBT lifestyle","A Christian charity worker in Malta could face jail time after he claimed that his faith enabled him to turn away from a homosexual lifestyle he no longer wanted.

Matthew Grech, 33, faces potential fines and imprisonment for allegedly falling afoul of his country's ban on ""conversion practices"" when he explained to a local media outlet last year how he left homosexuality behind because he came to believe it was wrong.

""I was invited by this new emerging platform in Malta called PMnews to share my story and to discuss sexuality in general,"" Grech told Fox News Digital, noting that he was ""surprised"" when police later called him early on a Sunday morning and ultimately served him with a prosecution order summoning him to court on Feb. 3.

Legal counsel for Grech maintains that his case is the first of its kind and threatens to set in motion a legal ""domino effect"" that could endanger freedom of speech and religious liberty throughout the Western world.

THOUSANDS OF CHURCHES RAISE ALARM ABOUT SCOPE OF NEW CANADIAN ‘CONVERSION THERAPY’ BAN

‘Domino effect’

According to a transcript of his interview with PMnews Malta, at no point did Grech invite anyone to attend therapy to change their sexual orientation or gender identity, though he was critical of the Maltese law and explained how he came to believe that homosexuality is not an identity, but rather a practice that was incompatible with his Christian faith.

""They knew my stance around homosexuality and sexuality in general, so they wanted to hear a little bit more about it because many shun the other side of the story,"" Grech said. ""But these guys wanted to explore it because they're for freedom of speech, and they don't like it when viewpoints are shut down simply because they are unpopular.""

Grech said that after LGBT activists with ties to the Maltese government and the Malta Gay Rights Movement (MGRM) reported him to police for the interview, he now faces up to €5,000 in fines or up to five months in prison if convicted of violating Article 3 of Malta’s Affirmation of Sexual Orientation, Gender and Gender Expression Act, which makes it ""unlawful for any person"" to ""advertise conversion practices."" The journalists who interviewed him also have upcoming court dates and face potential criminal sanctions for their part in conducting the interview.

MGRM did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment by time of publication.

Grech is slated to appear before the Court of Magistrates in Valletta on Feb. 3, where he will be assisted in legal defense by the Christian Legal Centre (CLC), a London-based nonprofit that focuses on cases of religious discrimination against Christians.

Andrea Williams, chief executive of the CLC, said in a statement provided to Fox News Digital that Grech’s treatment by Maltese authorities is discriminatory and violates ""his Christian freedoms and fundamental right to free speech.""

Grech's lawyers plan to argue that his prosecution is a violation of his right to freedom of expression guaranteed under both the Constitution of Malta and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).

""The domino effect of ‘conversion therapy’ bans began in Malta,"" said Williams, who warned that the case threatens to set a precedent that could spread to other Western countries ""unless robust action is taken.""

Malta, an island nation between Sicily and the coast of North Africa, was the first country in the European Union to criminalize practices that would seek to ""change, repress or eliminate a person's sexual orientation, gender identity and/or gender expression.""

BIDEN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO CRACK DOWN ON ‘CONVERSION THERAPY,’ ACCUSE REPUBLICANS OF SEEKING TO ‘BULLY KIDS’

The legislation, which passed unanimously in 2016, resembles conversion therapy bans throughout the world, including in 20 states and more than 100 municipalities in the U.S.

Many such bans in the U.S. apply only to minors and carve out exemptions for religious counseling, though some in other countries prohibit consenting adults from seeking help from anyone for unwanted sexual attractions and behaviors.

""They want to ban Christian counseling in churches simply because it does not conform to their religion. They claim not to be religious, but I can tell you that they are just as religious as everybody else."" — Matthew Grech

In Canada, therapists who provide any form of counseling to repress or reduce ""non-heterosexual attraction or sexual behavior"" or ""non-cisgender identity"" could face up to five years in prison, according to a law put in place last year that prompted protests from thousands of churches throughout North America because of its scope.

The Conservative Party-led U.K. government announced this week a plan to debate legislation to add transgender identity to Britain's proposed conversion therapy ban, which before applied only to sexual orientation.

The United Nations has deemed conversion therapy as tantamount to torture, and U.N. Independent Expert on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Victor Madrigal-Borloz called for a global ban on it in 2020.

‘Simply barbaric’

During a 2020 interview similar to that which led to his prosecution, Grech recalled how his gentle personality and boyhood musical interests made him a target growing up among other boys, who bullied him and mocked him as gay.

He said he would assume that label as an identity and go on to become involved in sexual relationships with other men in an attempt to find male acceptance, but that he began to desire a new lifestyle upon becoming a Christian.

Grech became involved with the U.K.-based International Federation for Therapeutic and Counseling Choice (IFTCC), an organization that aims ""to promote a caring, nonjudgmental environment where people who choose to move away from their unwanted feelings and behaviors can find the support they’re seeking,"" according to its website.

He is also a trustee of Core Issues Trust, a group that works closely with IFTCC and supports ""men and women with homosexual issues who voluntarily seek change in sexual preference and expression.""

Grech says there many others like him who have ""very valid reasons"" for seeking to move away from unwanted sexual feelings, but fears such individuals are increasingly being marginalized and driven underground by the effects of overbroad conversion therapy bans.

""To deny people access to spiritual or secular support in any context is barbaric,"" he said. ""It's simply barbaric.""

AMERICANS OPPOSE TRANSGENDER SURGERIES, ANTI-PUBERTY BLOCKERS FOR MINORS: POLL

Grech believes the activists propelling the sort of conversion therapy ban enforcement he is facing ""don't just want to ban forced help or support, they want to ban our views altogether.""

""They want to ban Christian counseling in churches simply because it does not conform to their religion,"" he said. ""They claim not to be religious, but I can tell you that they are just as religious as everybody else. They do have a belief system, they do have a very specific vision.""

Despite its small size, Grech noted that Maltese culture is seen as a ""forerunner"" and ""pioneer"" in Europe, consistently ranking at the top of ILGA-Europe's list of most progressive countries.

Parliamentary Secretary Rebecca Buttigieg announced last week that Malta is strengthening its conversion therapy law by adding an amendment to redefine the advertising clause ""to include the publishing, advertising, displaying, distributing, referral and circulation of any material promoting the practice,"" according to the Times of Malta.

""So it is concerning the other countries will follow suit, but we need to alert other nations and to show them what the real face of a conversion therapy ban is,"" Grech said. ""It's just a foothold for these LGBT lobbies to get into churches and to get the pastors and get the gospel ministers to shut up and conform, and it's just simply not sustainable.""

‘The idol of our generation’

Grech noted the irony that the first case of his kind should be in Malta, which has a notable position in the history of his faith. One of the first Roman colonies to convert to Christianity, the island featured in the New Testament as the place where the apostle Paul was shipwrecked and left unharmed from the bite of a venomous snake that emerged from a fire.

""That story speaks to us to this day, because when Paul arrived in Malta, a fire was set because it was cold, and a snake fastened itself against his arm,"" Grech said, referencing the story in Acts 28. ""He shook it off, told it where it needs to go, and it went back to the fire.""

""People at first thought he was being judged by the gods because that snake fastened itself around his arm, but when they saw that nothing happened to him, they changed their minds,"" he said.

DETRANSITIONING TIKTOKER WAS 'HORRIFIED' AFTER LGBT ACTIVIST CLAIMED ‘DETRANSITIONING’ IS NOT ‘A REAL THING’

Grech likened the biblical story to his legal battle and the spiritual struggles of people like him who fight to maintain their faith despite their feelings amid what he sees as the tightening grip of opposition from government and the culture.

""I believe that as we survive this snake that is trying to poison us and harm us, as we look toward God, who is able to save us and redeem us, people will shift their perspective,"" he said.

""We believe in the best for our nation, but there has been an idol that has been set up, and it needs to come down,"" Grech added.

Christian mom sues after 4-year-old was allegedly forced to participate in LGBT pride march: 'Just horrific',"A Christian mother in the U.K. is having her case heard in London on Wednesday after she took legal action when her 4-year-old son was allegedly compelled to participate in his school's LGBT pride march against her will.

Izoduwa Montague made headlines in 2018 when she claimed the headteacher at Heavers Farm Primary School in Croydon, South London, aggressively informed her that her son was not allowed to opt out of the march despite her family's religious beliefs.

When she made an appointment to discuss the issue at the school, she said the deputy head, who was also the headteacher's daughter, showed up wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the phrase: ""Why be racist, sexist, homophobic, or transphobic when you could just be quiet?""

""It was shocking, to be honest,"" Montague told Fox News Digital.

UK SCHOOL CHAPLAIN SUES AFTER BEING FIRED, REPORTED AS TERRORIST FOR SERMON QUESTIONING LGBTQ ACTIVISTS

With the aid of the London-based Christian Legal Centre, Montague sued on the grounds of direct and indirect discrimination, victimization and breach of statutory duty under the Education Act 1996 and the Human Rights Act 1998. Her case is slated to be heard until Feb. 10.

Montague's case is potentially a landmark one that will be the first time a court in the U.K. will examine the legal basis of imposing LGBT ideology on primary schools, according to the Christian Legal Centre, which noted the issue has also led to tensions between schools and members of the Jewish and Muslim communities in the country.

""My child was forced to celebrate Pride, forced to partake in a Pride parade, and we thought that it was going to end there, which was sadly wrong,"" Montague said. ""The school just went crazy. They were so angry that any parent was annoyed about this, they just decided that they were just going turn the whole school into a big LGBT-friendly school.""

Montague said the school became replete with books, flags, posters and other materials promoting the LGBT lifestyle to its youngest pupils. A photo reportedly emerged on the school's website of a young student expressing hope that someday boys and girls could use the same restroom. She said after her meeting with school leadership, her son was placed in a three-hour detention and segregated from his peers.

""So after that, he had to be removed from the school,"" she said. ""It was just horrific.""

Montague ultimately placed her son in a Catholic primary school, but also decided to take legal action.

CASE TOSSED OUT AGAINST CHRISTIAN PREACHER ARRESTED FOR ALLEGED HOMOPHOBIA

""Even though I had already made up my mind that he was going to leave the school anyway, I definitely felt that that was just taking it to a whole new level, where you're pretending that you're promoting tolerance and peace, and then you end up bullying people for not sharing the same belief that you do on sexual lifestyles,"" she explained.

""Those who preach tolerance and diversity the loudest do not appear to be interested in practicing it."" — Christian Legal Centre executive director Andrea Williams

""I think that is ridiculous, and all parents should not be forced to take on a school's sexual beliefs or any social beliefs on the fear that you will get bullied and segregated,"" she said. ""Children should be protected in school.""

Montague said the state of free speech in her country is ""really scary,"" and she speculated that she would have faced more pushback for her stance if she lived in a more liberal part of London. She noted that she and others in the U.K. have had the police called on them for expressing opinions that oppose LGBT ideology.

UK WOMAN ARRESTED FOR PRAYING NEAR ABORTION CENTER WARNS MORE ARRESTS MAY COME

Andrea Williams, executive director of the Christian Legal Centre, said in a statement provided to Fox News Digital that Montague's case ""epitomizes the chaos we can expect to see in the coming years in our schools and is another example of the ‘totalitolerance’ that has become so prevalent in our society. Those who preach tolerance and diversity the loudest do not appear to be interested in practicing it.""

""The treatment of parents at Heavers Farm Primary School represents some of the most chilling breaches of parental rights I have ever seen in my many years of working on educational issues,"" Williams continued, adding that the school's actions ""showed disrespect, dismissiveness and hostility"" toward parents.

""A particular agenda is being forced onto children inside the school gates and parents are being given no means to ensure that their children are being taught in line with their religious and philosophical beliefs,"" she added.

Colombians stage kiss-a-thon in support of LGBT rights,"next Image 1 of 2

prev Image 2 of 2

Dozens of same sex couples kissed simultaneously outside an upscale shopping mall in Colombia's capital Wednesday, in the latest demonstration calling for LGBT rights in the South American country.

The ""kiss-a-thon"" was held just days after two gay men in their early 20s were harassed at the Andino shopping center by a man who pushed the couple, screamed profanities at them and accused them of fondling each other in front of a group of children.

Esteban Miranda and Nicolas Tellez denied doing that, saying they were only hugging and holding hands just like many heterosexual couples strolling the mall's flashy corridors. They quickly called the police to seek protection from the enraged man but were instead fined for indecent exposure.

The incident was caught on video by bystanders and shared widely on social media, sparking a wave of support for the young gay couple.

On Wednesday night, hundreds of activists waving rainbow flags gathered around one of the mall's entrances and screamed chants in support of gay rights.

Paola Gutierrez, 21, hugged her girlfriend and gave her a heartfelt kiss on the lips, after a protest organizer with a megaphone urged participants to express their ""freedom"" to love.

""Kissing someone is no crime,"" said Gutierrez, who wore a pair of rainbow colored suspenders. ""All we want is for there to be less divisions in this society, and no discrimination against people over their sexual preferences.""

Colombia is one of South America's more liberal countries when it comes to LGBT legislation. Same-sex couples in the Andean nation can form civil unions and adopt children, something they are not allowed to do in neighboring countries like Venezuela and Peru.

But experts say homosexuality is still perceived negatively by much of Colombia's population, leading to frequent cases of discrimination.

Gutierrez said that she and her girlfriend get cat-called by men when they hold hands in the street.

Another protester, Nicolas Lara, said he was once sent to a psychiatrist at a public hospital after he told a doctor there that he had relationships with other men.

""There's no place for these incidents in the 21st century,"" Lara said. ""We need to work toward a more tolerant society.""",https://www.foxnews.com/world/colombians-stage-kiss-a-thon-in-support-of-lgbt-rights,N/A
Fears rise over LGBT discrimination in conservative Paraguay,"next Image 1 of 2

prev Image 2 of 2

Mariana Sepulveda has been stabbed on the street, detained by police and expelled from her high school — all for being transgender in Paraguay, one of the most sexually conservative countries in Latin America.

""I've felt hate for not being heterosexual,"" said Sepulveda, 32, who now works for an advocacy group. ""Raising a family, having a partner, adopting children seems out of reach because there are no legal conditions for us in Paraguay.""

A lack of legal protections and prevalent macho attitudes have long stoked discrimination against lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgender people in the poor, mostly Roman Catholic country. Advocacy groups fear the stigma and attacks on the LGBQT community could get worse now that the education minister has banned classes about sexual diversity in schools and even volunteered to help burn all books related to the subject.

The ban was implemented in October after the United Nations Children's Fund issued a guidebook for teachers on avoiding discrimination between girls and boys and achieving gender equality.

""We're not going to promote gender ideology,"" Education Minister Enrique Riera told local media earlier this year. ""We're going to base ourselves on what is expressed in the constitution, which says that marriage is between a man and a woman.""

Gay rights groups say the ban goes against Paraguay's constitution because it is discriminatory and ignores the recommendations by UNICEF and other international organizations.

""We're living a sad time of religious fundamentalism, intolerance and hate that places this country as the most homophobic one of the region,"" Somos Gay, a Paraguayan gay rights group, said in a statement. It added that ""this situation has an impact on human lives. Hate crimes, bullying and violence are the disastrous consequences of this encouragement of homophobia.""

Attitudes about LGBQT rights in Paraguay stand in sharp contrast to other countries in the region.

Neighboring Argentina lets people change their legal and physical gender identity without having to undergo judicial, psychiatric and medical procedures and has appointed its first transgender police chief. Uruguay's first transgender senator assumed her seat in October. Chile's center-left government is pushing an array of proposed laws to bolster gender rights, such as allowing transgender people to change their legal identities without a judge's approval and reserving 1 percent of state jobs for transgender applicants.

But conservative institutions such as the Catholic Church retain a strong influence in Paraguay.

""There's the indifference of the state toward sexual minorities to avoid confronting the church,"" said Ramon Corvalan, a Paraguayan anthropologist. ""The lay state thing is just a statement in the constitution. The church is still strong here.""

He said that ""homophobia in Paraguay has a cultural origin based in male chauvinism"" that dates back to wars that shaped the country.

Nearly two of every three Paraguayans died in a disastrous war against Argentina and Brazil in 1865-70. The victorious 1932-35 Chaco War with Bolivia was also devastating. Both left a heavy imbalance between the male and female populations.

""There was an availability of many women for the men who had survived the wars in an effort to repopulate the country,"" Corvalan said.

Earlier this year, the U.N. Human Rights Council recommended Paraguay pass a law to eliminate discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, but it has not done so.

""Perhaps international organizations like the U.N. and its agencies are worried about this issue of rejection for non-heterosexuals, but in Paraguay it's not a key issue,"" said political analyst Ignacio Martinez.

President Horacio Cartes has also been criticized for his attitudes toward the LGBQT community. Just months before he was elected in 2013, he compared gay people to monkeys and said he would rather shoot himself in the testicles before his son married a man. Cartes later apologized, but the comments have not seemed to hurt his political career.

The ban on teaching about sexual diversity may further stall Paraguay's embrace of LGBQT rights.

At a school on the outskirts of Asuncion, students wrote a report seeking to prove that homosexuality is a ""social problem."" After it went viral on social media, the school principal, Margarita Aquino, apologized and acknowledged that in Paraguay's ""public schools, sexual education doesn't exist.""

But the leaders of some communities say they prefer it this way.

""We don't support same-sex marriage because it's not natural, and we oppose that in our schools they teach our boys and girls that being gay, trans or lesbian is a choice,"" said Carolina Aranda, mayor of the city of Mariano Roque Alonso. ""I'm not homophobic; I have gay friends. But I don't want them to teach kids things that are not normal.""",https://www.foxnews.com/world/fears-rise-over-lgbt-discrimination-in-conservative-paraguay,N/A
Hundreds of Muslim parents protest school in Britain over LGBT curriculum,"Hundreds of Muslim parents and their children – dressed up as superheroes – protested outside a primary school in Britain on Thursday against planned lessons on LGBT rights.

More than 200 protesters organized the demonstration against Parkfield Community School in Birmingham over the school program called “No Outsiders” that includes teachings about homosexuality, including same-sex relationships and marriages, and challenges homophobia.

The organizers accused assistant head Andrew Moffatt, who is gay, of promoting LGBT rights against the wishes of the parents, who carried placards reading “Say no to sexualizing children” and “respect and be respected.”

Thursday’s protest came even as the school, where virtually every child has Muslim parents, reportedly suspended the curriculum in response to the outrage and protests. About 600 children were withdrawn from the school in a day as a result of the program, which also teaches about race, religion, gender identity, age and disabilities.

“Up to the end of this term, we will not be delivering any No Outsiders lessons in our long-term year curriculum plan, as this half term has already been blocked for religious education (RE),” the school said in a letter to parents, the Guardian reported. “Equality assemblies will continue as normal and our welcoming No Outsiders ethos will be there for all.”

The school denied that it caved to the protesters and said that the class on gay rights stopped at half-term as planned.

But the school admitted that before the return of the classes they will need to have a discussion with parents and teachers about it, according to the BBC.

Some parents during the protest spoke to the crowd through a megaphone, saying the lessons weren’t “age appropriate” and accused the school of violating not only children’s but also their religious beliefs, as Islam doesn’t approve homosexuality.

Protesters said they will continue to protest every week until the school nixes whole program.

"LGBT members of migrant caravan reach US border, say they endured verbal abuse by other migrants","A group of LGBT migrants arrived in Tijuana this weekend after reportedly breaking off from the larger U.S.-bound caravan due to verbal harassment and poor living conditions.

About 76 LGBT members of the caravan, which has about 3,600 members, described inter-caravan persecution and poor planning interfering with the members' ability to eat and bathe on a regular basis, according to Telemundo 20 in San Diego.

“Even taking a bath was a major problem,” a caravan member who is Honduran told Telemundo. “When we wanted to shower there was no water for us…for food it was the same thing.”

An anonymous group paid for the small group of LGBT migrants to take a bus to the border. They said just like in their native country, they endured verbal abuse while they traveled with the large migrant group, which is expected to reach the U.S. border in about 2-3 weeks.

MIGRANT CARAVAN LEAVES MEXICO CITY, WITH EYES ON US BORDER

The LGBT group plans on requesting political asylum at either the San Ysidro or Otay Mesa ports of entry, according to Telemundo.

“We are waiting for our representative,” the unidentified migrant said. “We want to do things right.”

Tuesday marks one month since about 160 people gathered in San Pedro Sula in Honduras to plan a trip to the U.S. border. That group eventually swelled into the thousands, drew international attention and became a lightning rod in U.S.-Mexico relations.

Sunday night, the rest of the caravan spent the night in Guanajuato, with plans to head to Guadalajara on Monday. The caravan continues to be spread out, with young men 100 miles or so ahead and women, children and families following behind.

A second caravan of 1,800 people is in Puebla, three days behind the main caravan, according to Mexican media reports. A third caravan of 2,000 people is about four days behind the main caravan.

Most members of the caravan have traveled about 130 miles per day.

During the weekend, federal police could be seen encouraging travelers to pick up migrants and take them to nearby shelters.

"Reporters face jail for interviewing Christian who left LGBT lifestyle, warn of assault on free speech","Two independent journalists in Malta are raising the alarm about attacks on freedom of speech ahead of their scheduled court appearance to answer for their recent interview with a Christian who left his homosexual lifestyle.

Editor Mario Camilleri and journalist Rita Bonnici of PMnews Malta were slapped with a prosecution order after conducting an interview last year with Matthew Grech, a 33-year-old Christian who explained that he abandoned homosexual behavior because of his faith.

Camilleri, Bonnici and Grech face charges of allegedly advertising conversion therapy in violation of Article 3 of Malta’s Affirmation of Sexual Orientation, Gender and Gender Expression Act, which makes it ""unlawful for any person"" to ""advertise conversion practices."" The offense carries €5,000 in fines or up to five months in prison.

According to a transcript of the interview, at no point did Grech invite anyone to attend therapy to change their sexual orientation or gender identity, but explained how he came to believe that homosexuality is not an identity, but rather a practice that was incompatible with his Christian faith. Both Camilleri and Bonnici at times pushed back against some of Grech's assertions during the interview.

CHRISTIAN CHARITY WORKER FACES POTENTIAL JAIL TIME, FINE AFTER SPEAKING ABOUT LEAVING LGBT LIFESTYLE

Bonnici said her outlet launched in part as a response to the clampdown on information amid the pandemic and interviewed a doctor who questioned the government's response to it, which she believes put a target on their back even before the interview with Grech.

""We were asking questions as individuals at that time, and we didn't have any media supporting us,"" she said. ""So we decided to get our own media and to give voice to people who would like to ask questions and share experiences of what they were going through.""

""I think that we got targeted because we believe in freedom of expression, freedom of speech and freedom of choice most of all. But it seems that because we are allowing this to happen, they are trying to do whatever they are doing to keep our mouth shut.""

TUCKER: CENSORSHIP NOW DEFINES AMERICA'S PUBLIC CONVERSATION

Camilleri said that in addition to the anonymous complaints over the Grech interview that have landed them in court, PMnews Malta has also faced suppression on Facebook. He noted Maltese press has been silent on their case, but he is confident they will win. ""We are going to fight it at all costs until our last drop of blood as all this goes against the fundamental right of speech,"" he said.

""[R]ather than acting to be a watchdog, as it were, rather than speaking truth to power, they're pandering to power, and this news outlet is one of the very few that's actually pushing in its way to guarantee a bit of freedom of speech.""

Rodolfo Ragonesi, a Maltese journalist and researcher who has contributed to PMnews Malta, said in recent years ""there has been pushback against freedom of speech on these islands, and in Europe in general.""

""And unfortunately, even though the free press is supposed to be there to basically keep power under control, it's not been happening. And what we've been seeing in the last two or three years is that a lot of the media outlets in this part of the world have become compromised and captured simply because they haven't been doing very well financially.""

CENSOR OR ELSE: DEMOCRATIC LAWMAKERS WARN FACEBOOK NOT TO ‘BACKSLIDE’ ON CENSORSHIP

Ragonesi noted the difficulty outlets around the world are facing from the power of Big Tech, which he said is ""in bed"" with state actors via government grants to establish ""fact-checking"" algorithms.

""So rather than acting to be a watchdog, as it were, rather than speaking truth to power, they're pandering to power, and this news outlet is one of the very few that's actually pushing in its way to guarantee a bit of freedom of speech,"" he said.

""Independent of the subject matter, I think it's a bit of a first for Malta that a news outlet is being dragged into court because they have organized a program on a subject""

Ragonesi, who is also an attorney involved in a constitutional case against the country's superintendent of public health, believes that the state of free speech in Europe has not been under so much threat since the end of World War II.

The case against PMnews Malta especially indicates ""the whole ethos of media has changed,"" he said.

""I've had the opportunity to be involved as a correspondent submitting pieces on international law, international affairs, research and history for over 20 years, and I've seen how the media here in Malta has started to close ranks and started to carry out some censorship of others,"" he said.

""I think that what we used to see as taking a bit of initiative, to speak truth to power,"" he continued. ""That's not happening the way it used to, and that is a cause of major concern.""

The Latest on the banned LGBT march in Istanbul (all times local):

6:45 p.m.

Turkish police have prevented people from gathering in large numbers for LGBT pride in Istanbul as small groups continue to make ad hoc demonstrations despite a ban issued by the governor.

Organizers of the 2017 Istanbul LGBTI+ Pride called for the march in central Taksim Square, using a Turkish hashtag for ""we march."" The Istanbul governor's office on Saturday banned the event — for the third year in a row — citing reasons of safety and public order.

Police established checkpoints in the area on Sunday, preventing groups from entering Istiklal Avenue and turning back people who they deemed were associated with the march.

At least a hundred protesters gathered in the nearby Cihangir neighborhood, beating drums and chanting slogans: ""Don't be quiet, shout out, gays exist!""

Police also used tear gas to disperse crowds and activists say plastic bullets were used.

4:44 p.m.

Police barricades, riot-control vehicles and buses were dispatched to the area where activists for lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and intersex rights say they plan to launch a pride march that the governor banned.

The governor's ban cited safety concerns and ""serious reactions by different segments of society"" as several nationalist and religious groups called for the march's cancellation.

But Pride organizers said in a statement Sunday that the threats themselves should be dealt with rather than limiting demonstrations.

The statement said: ""Our security will be provided by recognizing us in the constitution, by securing justice, by equality and freedom.""

LGBT activists have long lobbied unsuccessfully to have sexual orientation and gender identity covered by Turkish laws protecting civil rights and prohibiting hate speech.

Homosexuality has been legal in Turkey since the republic's founding more than nine decades ago.

1:55 p.m.

Activists for lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and intersex rights say they will march for Pride in Istanbul, despite a ban by the governor's office.

Organizers of the 2017 Istanbul LGBTI Pride said Sunday the gathering would begin at 5 p.m. (14:00 GMT) in central Taksim Square, using a Turkish hashtag for ""we march.""

The Istanbul governor's office on Saturday banned the event — for the third year in a row — citing safety and public order fears. The statement also said the governor's office had not received a valid parade application — a claim rejected by organizers.

For more than a decade, Turkish authorities allowed Pride marches to take place. Up to 100,000 people attended Istanbul Pride in 2014 but Turkish police dispersed Pride crowds in 2015 and 2016 using riot-control methods.",https://www.foxnews.com/world/the-latest-tear-gas-checkpoints-greet-lgbt-pride-in-turkey,N/A
"UK police forces spend thousands on rainbow cars, flags supporting LGBT community: 'woke nonsense'","Police forces across the United Kingdom have spent £66,000, or nearly $80,000, on merchandise such as rainbow-themed cars and flags to support the LGBTQ community, a report found.

""Police chiefs have been caught red-handed wasting money on woke nonsense,"" Tom Ryan, a researcher at the Taxpayers’ Alliance, told the Telegraph.

The Telegraph reported that 27 police departments in England and Wales spent £66,689 on rainbow-themed merchandise between 2019 and 2022, according to data released under freedom of information laws.

The data, according to the Telegraph, found the South Wales Police force was the biggest spender, forking over £24,000, or roughly $29,000, for rainbow-themed T-shirts, badges, pens, whistles, flags, water bottles and even sporks.

Other departments spent funds to deck cars out with rainbow-themed stickers, on items called ""rainbow fuzzy bugs,"" as well as for fans and stickers.

The National Police Chiefs’ Council has previously said that rainbow-themed patrol vehicles act as ""hate-crime cars"" and encourage members of the public to report hate crimes, including social media posts, according to the Telegraph.

The Taxpayers’ Alliance, a nonpartisan group that advocates for lower taxes in the UK, slammed the spending, noting that crime is on the rise and funds should instead be used to bolster public safety.

""With crime on the up, it will bring little comfort to Brits knowing that bobbies are kitted out with rainbow merchandise,"" Ryan told the Telegraph. ""Police forces should put a stop to this pointless spending and focus funds on the frontline.""

Various institutions in the UK have come under fire in recent months for reportedly embracing ""woke culture,"" including London’s transportation agency after it published new guidelines last year for staff that ban words such as ""bicycles"" and ""accident"" for more welcoming and inclusive language.

The director of The Heritage Foundation's Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom, Nile Gardiner, told Fox News Digital at the time that the pervasive ""wokism"" in the country is a ""nefarious destructive ideology.""

""It is just completely ridiculous the rise of wokism in the U.K. It’s a nefarious destructive ideology that is advanced by the far left but adopted by a large number of British institutions. And it has no place in British society. It is hugely divisive and fundamentally un-British,"" he said.",https://www.foxnews.com/world/uk-police-forces-spend-thousands-rainbow-cars-flags-supporting-lgbt-community,N/A
